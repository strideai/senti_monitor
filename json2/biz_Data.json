Bank and Men\u2019s Wearhouse has finally come to an end, with the former \u2014 the smaller of the two companies \u2014 securing an admirable $1.8 billion offer from the latter. The saga will be remembered in the retail sector record books, industry watchers said.\n\nBoth companies\u2019 stocks reached record highs on Tuesday. For Men\u2019s Wearhouse \/quotes\/zigman\/233713\/delayed \/quotes\/nls\/mw MW , investors were excited about the cost synergy, cross-merchandising and other growth opportunities that are expected to make Men\u2019s Wearhouse a stronger No. 4 player in the U.S. men\u2019s apparel space.\n\nJos. A. Bank\u2019s maneuvering is being called a brilliant move. Let\u2019s recap: the company launched its initial bid in October, which Men\u2019s Wearhouse rejected and then countered with its own offers. Each party launched its own poison pill, and Jos. A. Bank \/quotes\/zigman\/56759\/delayed \/quotes\/nls\/josb JOSB agreed to buy Eddie Bauer to up the game \u2014 an \u201camazing\u201d piece of boardroom maneuvering, analysts said.\n\nMen\u2019s Wearhouse\u2019s final $65 per-share offer marked a 56% premium over Jos. A. Bank\u2019s closing price on Oct. 8, a day before it first made a move on its larger rival.\n\n\u201cThis has been, assuming everything stays on track, a master class example of how to maximize value for your shareholders,\u201d Customer Growth Partners President Craig Johnson told MarketWatch, adding the premium was far richer than the 30% premium Saks got in its sales to Hudson\u2019s Bay Co. in a high profile recent acquisition. \u201cI can\u2019t think, within retail, of a similarly well-choreographed value-creation waltz like we\u2019ve seen here.\u201d\n\nIn his over 40 years as a mergers and acquisition lawyer, Jerry Reisman, a partner at Garden City, New York-based law firm Reisman, Peirez, Reisman and Capobianco, said the deal marked an unusual example of a successful \u2018Pac Man\u2019 defense engineered by Men\u2019s Wearhouse.\n\n\u201cEach one was strategically moving to take steps to block the other,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cA Pac Man defense is unusual. Ultimately Men\u2019s Wearhouse succeeded. Jos. A. Bank (also) got a fantastic offer. I\u2019d give them a 10 for what they accomplished. They did well for Jos. A. Bank shareholders. They might have reached this price long term on their own, but not in the short term. Men\u2019s Wearhouse paid a top price.\u201d\n\nSo who is the biggest winner in this deal?\n\nThat would be hedge fund Eminence Capital. As Men\u2019s Wearhouse\u2019s largest shareholder with a nearly 10% stake, it also is the fourth largest shareholder of Jos. A. Bank, with a 4.9% stake.\n\n\u2013 Follow Andria on Twitter @AndriaCheng.\n\nMore from Behind the Storefront:\n\nMen\u2019s Wearhouse to buy Jos. A.

Bank will combine to create the nation\u2019s fourth largest seller of men\u2019s wear.\n\nMen\u2019s Wearhouse Inc. said Tuesday that it\u2019s buying its rival Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc. for $1.8 billion. The company will pay $65 a share, a 5 percent premium to Jos. A. Bank\u2019s most recent closing price. As part of the deal, Jos. A. Bank also said it\u2019s terminating its deal to acquire the parent company of Eddie Bauer, which sells rugged outerwear.\n\nShares of both companies rose on the news: Men\u2019s Wearhouse\u2019s shares were up nearly 5 percent to $57.13, while shares of Jos. A. Bank increased nearly 4 percent to $64.22.\n\nThe acquisition comes after months of the two chains publicly fighting over who would acquire whom. Industry watchers had speculated that a merger was inevitable given the challenges the companies face in the increasingly competitive men\u2019s wear landscape. With more than 1,700 U.S. stores and $3.5 billion in annual sales, the combined company\u2019s reach in men\u2019s clothing will fall behind only Macy\u2019s, Kohl\u2019s and J.C. Penney.\n\n\u201cTogether, Men\u2019s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank will have increased scale and breadth,\u201d Doug Ewert, president and CEO of Men\u2019s Wearhouse, said in a statement.\n\nJos. A. Bank made the first move in October when it offered to buy its larger rival for $2.3 billion, just a few months after Men\u2019s Wearhouse ousted its founder and chairman. Men\u2019s Wearhouse shot down that offer, and turned the tables, offering to buy its rival for $1.54 billion. But after Jos. A. Bank turned down that bid, Men\u2019s Wearhouse increased its offer to $1.6 billion, and then again to $1.78 billion.\n\nIn the middle of the back-and forth, Jos. A. Bank said last month that it was buying the parent of Eddie Bauer, but left the door open for a deal with Men\u2019s Wearhouse. At the time, it said if it received a superior acquisition offer, it would pay a termination fee to end the Eddie Bauer deal.\n\nBy early March, Men\u2019s Wearhouse had an offer of $63.50 per share on the table but said it may raise the bid to $65 per share if some conditions were met.\n\nDespite, the rough courting period, both companies say they expect a smooth integration. In a joint press release, they said shareholders of both companies will benefit from about $100 million to $150 million in savings realized over three years as it streamlines its duplicative corporate function and improves its sourcing and merchandising. A spokesman for Men\u2019s Wearhouse declined to comment on any layoffs or comment on management changes beyond what the release said: \u201cmanagement will consist of the most qualified individuals from both organizations. \u201d\n\n\u201cOur board has been rigorously focused on pursuing a path for our shareholders that maximizes value created,\u201d said Robert N. Wildrick, chairman of Jos. A. Bank\u2019s board. \u201cThe transaction we are announcing today clearly reflects the success of our efforts.\u201d\n\nAnalysts say there\u2019s a bright future for the combined company. The suit business, which generated $2.3 billion in revenue last year, has been relatively healthy. The business has been up 4 percent over the past three years, after being flat or down since the recession, according to market research firm NPD Group. That has been fueled by tight-fitting suits that have attracted young males.\n\nThe companies also have complementary businesses. Men\u2019s Wearhouse, which sells men\u2019s sportswear and suits through its 1,200 stores at its Men\u2019s Wearhouse, Moores and K&G chains, caters to young male customers looking for their first suit. Meanwhile Jos. A. Banks focuses on a more established clientele that\u2019s looking for a good deal at its 623 stores with promotions like \u201cbuy one suit or sport coat and get three free.\u201d\n\nBut the industry is still competitive, and to grab men\u2019s shopping dollars, analysts say both chains have had to compete with fierce promotions.\n\nStifel Nicholaus analyst Richard Jaffe said that the acquisition means that both companies can lower costs, whether it\u2019s buying shopping bags or buying TV ads. He also noted each could borrow their expertise. He could see Jos. A. Bank selling tuxedos, for instance, or Men\u2019s Wearhouse improving on its sportswear offerings.\n\n\u201cThere are real cost savings and opportunities to turn around the business,\u201d he said.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close by the third quarter."},"Doc_sentiment":{"0":{"score":-2.59,"sentiment":"Ne"},"1":{"score":3.19,"sentiment":"P"},"2":{"score":-2.96,"sentiment":"Ne"},"3":{"score":-2.96,"sentiment":"Ne"},"4":{"score":8.7,"sentiment":"VP"},"5":{"score":0.0,"sentiment":"N"},"6":{"score":0.7,"sentiment":"N"},"7":{"score":1.32,"sentiment":"P"},"8":{"score":2.14,"sentiment":"P"},"9":{"score":0.39,"sentiment":"N"}},"Subject_sentiment":{"0":{"sentiment_map":[{"category":"positive","text":"Mark Montagna","negative_score":0,"positive_score":7.86},{"category":"positive","text":"deal","negative_score":0,"positive_score":1.2},{"category":"positive","text":"Montagna","negative_score":0,"positive_score":2.0},{"category":"mixed","text":"Jos .
