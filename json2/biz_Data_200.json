Bank and Men\u2019s Wearhouse has finally come to an end, with the former \u2014 the smaller of the two companies \u2014 securing an admirable $1.8 billion offer from the latter. The saga will be remembered in the retail sector record books, industry watchers said.\n\nBoth companies\u2019 stocks reached record highs on Tuesday.

Bank will combine to create the nation\u2019s fourth largest seller of men\u2019s wear.\n\nMen\u2019s Wearhouse Inc. said Tuesday that it\u2019s buying its rival Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc. for $1.8 billion. The company will pay $65 a share, a 5 percent premium to Jos. A. Bank\u2019s most recent closing price. As part of the deal, Jos. A. Bank also said it\u2019s terminating its deal to acquire the parent company of Eddie Bauer, which sells rugged outerwear.\n\nShares of both companies rose on the news: Men\u2019s Wearhouse\u2019s shares were up nearly 5 percent to $57.13, while shares of Jos. A. Bank increased nearly 4 percent to $64.22.\n\nThe acquisition comes after months of the two chains publicly fighting over who would acquire whom. Industry watchers had speculated that a merger was inevitable given the challenges the companies face in the increasingly competitive men\u2019s wear landscape. With more than 1,700 U.S. stores and $3.5 billion in annual sales, the combined company\u2019s reach in men\u2019s clothing will fall behind only Macy\u2019s, Kohl\u2019s and J.C. Penney.\n\n\u201cTogether, Men\u2019s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank will have increased scale and breadth,\u201d Doug Ewert, president and CEO of Men\u2019s Wearhouse, said in a statement.\n\nJos. A. Bank made the first move in October when it offered to buy its larger rival for $2.3 billion, just a few months after Men\u2019s Wearhouse ousted its founder and chairman. Men\u2019s Wearhouse shot down that offer, and turned the tables, offering to buy its rival for $1.54 billion. But after Jos. A. Bank turned down that bid, Men\u2019s Wearhouse increased its offer to $1.6 billion, and then again to $1.78 billion.\n\nIn the middle of the back-and forth, Jos. A. Bank said last month that it was buying the parent of Eddie Bauer, but left the door open for a deal with Men\u2019s Wearhouse. At the time, it said if it received a superior acquisition offer, it would pay a termination fee to end the Eddie Bauer deal.\n\nBy early March, Men\u2019s Wearhouse had an offer of $63.50 per share on the table but said it may raise the bid to $65 per share if some conditions were met.\n\nDespite, the rough courting period, both companies say they expect a smooth integration. In a joint press release, they said shareholders of both companies will benefit from about $100 million to $150 million in savings realized over three years as it streamlines its duplicative corporate function and improves its sourcing and merchandising. A spokesman for Men\u2019s Wearhouse declined to comment on any layoffs or comment on management changes beyond what the release said: \u201cmanagement will consist of the most qualified individuals from both organizations. \u201d\n\n\u201cOur board has been rigorously focused on pursuing a path for our shareholders that maximizes value created,\u201d said Robert N. Wildrick, chairman of Jos. A. Bank\u2019s board. \u201cThe transaction we are announcing today clearly reflects the success of our efforts.\u201d\n\nAnalysts say there\u2019s a bright future for the combined company. The suit business, which generated $2.3 billion in revenue last year, has been relatively healthy. The business has been up 4 percent over the past three years, after being flat or down since the recession, according to market research firm NPD Group. That has been fueled by tight-fitting suits that have attracted young males.\n\nThe companies also have complementary businesses. Men\u2019s Wearhouse, which sells men\u2019s sportswear and suits through its 1,200 stores at its Men\u2019s Wearhouse, Moores and K&G chains, caters to young male customers looking for their first suit. Meanwhile Jos. A. Banks focuses on a more established clientele that\u2019s looking for a good deal at its 623 stores with promotions like \u201cbuy one suit or sport coat and get three free.\u201d\n\nBut the industry is still competitive, and to grab men\u2019s shopping dollars, analysts say both chains have had to compete with fierce promotions.\n\nStifel Nicholaus analyst Richard Jaffe said that the acquisition means that both companies can lower costs, whether it\u2019s buying shopping bags or buying TV ads. He also noted each could borrow their expertise. He could see Jos. A. Bank selling tuxedos, for instance, or Men\u2019s Wearhouse improving on its sportswear offerings.\n\n\u201cThere are real cost savings and opportunities to turn around the business,\u201d he said.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close by the third quarter.","11":"The next time you're looking to negotiate a deal, give the folks at Jos. A. Bank a call.\n\nAfter five months of back and forth, Jos. A. Bank agreed to be acquired by in a deal worth $1.8 billion. Men's Wearhouse will pay $65 per share in cash to purchase its smaller rival.\n\nMen's Wearhouse and Jos have been playing hard to get with one another since October. That was when Jos made the first move and bid for its larger rival. Men's Wearhouse rejected the offer, but it then chased Hampstead, MD-based Jos. A. Bank for months, making three bids for the company. It was rejected by Jos each time before finally scoring the deal today.\n\n\"This was an exciting cat and mouse game in a relatively boring, low-growth industry,\" says Brian Sozzi, CEO & chief equities strategist at Belus Capital Advisors.\n\nWhile Men's Wearhouse is finally getting what it wants by picking up its smaller suit-selling competitor, Jos A. Bank is the real winner of this M&A saga.\n\nThough Men's Wearhouse was making the most of the bids (it even took a hostile approach in January), Jos. A. Bank was the true aggressor throughout the process. Jos made the first move when it made a bold $2.3 billion bid, and when Men's Wearhouse reciprocated with bids of its own, Jos pushed back hard saying it wasn't interested.\n\nRobert N. Wildrick, chairman of Jos. A. Bank, said back in January, \"Our Board of Directors firmly believes that the Men's Wearhouse offer is inadequate and significantly undervalues Jos. A. Bank and its near- and long-term potential.\"\n\nBut even as it continued to reject the bids, Jos was likely interested in a deal with Men's Wearhouse all along. Why? It wanted the best possible offer. \"Jos played Men's Wearhouse like a fiddle,\" Sozzi says.\n\nJos. A. Bank even went as far as to make an offer for Eddie Bauer in February for $825 million. \"They had no intention of buying Eddie Bauer. It was an effort to get the last dime out of Men's Wearhouse,\" Sozzi addds.\n\nIt worked.\n\nLess than two weeks later, Men's Wearhouse increased its offer to $63.50 per share from its previous $57.50 offer. Days later, Jos was ready to talk and agreed to exchange confidential financials with Men's Wearhouse. Today's deal has Men's Wearhouse paying $65.00, or total consideration of $1.8 billion. That's up from the first offer from Men's Wearhouse at $55 per share, which represented an implied enterprise value of approximately $1.2 billion.\n\n\"This was Jos. A. Bank's show and Men's Wearhouse was living in it,\" says Sozzi, who predicted in October the two retailers would eventually agree to a deal.\n\nThe agreement is giving shareholders of both companies something to cheer about. Jos shares are up 3.9% while Men's Wearhouse shares are up 5.2% this afternoon.\n\nJames Gellert, CEO of Rapid Ratings, whose company rates public companies on their financial health, scores them from 0 to 100. Jos. A. Bank and Men's Wearhouse score a 69 and 62, respectively. Gellert says both companies have something to gain in the deal.\n\n\"Neither is generating impressive revenue but both have good margins meaning they are good at cost efficiencies,\" he says. The two companies will have a chance to cut costs further after they merge, specifically in their supply chain, Gellert adds.\n\nThere are still more crucial details that will need to be hammered out. Among them: What will the future management team look like? Leadership was reportedly a point of contention during the five-month back and forth.","12":"Our sincere apologies!

Bank is based in Hampstead, Md.\n\nThe acquisition comes after months of the two chains publicly fighting over who would acquire whom. Industry watchers had speculated that a merger was inevitable given the challenges the companies face in the increasingly competitive men\u2019s wear landscape. With more than 1,700 U.S. stores and $3.5 billion in annual sales, the combined company\u2019s reach in men\u2019s clothing will fall behind only Macy\u2019s, Kohl\u2019s and J.C.

In a joint press release, they said shareholders of both companies will benefit from about $100 million to $150 million in savings realized over three years as it streamlines its duplicative corporate function and improves its sourcing and merchandising. A spokesman for Men\u2019s Wearhouse declined to comment on any layoffs or comment on management changes beyond what the release said: \u201cmanagement will consist of the most qualified individuals from both organizations. \u201d\n\n\u201cOur board has been rigorously focused on pursuing a path for our shareholders that maximizes value created,\u201d said Robert N.

The suit business, which generated $2.3 billion in revenue last year, has been relatively healthy. The business has been up 4 percent over the past three years, after being flat or down since the recession, according to market research firm NPD Group. That has been fueled by tight-fitting suits that have attracted young males.\n\nThe companies also have complementary businesses. Men\u2019s Wearhouse, which sells men\u2019s sportswear and suits through its 1,200 stores at its Men\u2019s Wearhouse, Moores and K&G chains, caters to young male customers looking for their first suit. Meanwhile Jos. A. Banks focuses on a more established clientele that\u2019s looking for a good deal at its 623 stores with promotions like \u201cbuy one suit or sport coat and get three free.\u201d\n\nBut the industry is still competitive, and to grab men\u2019s shopping dollars, analysts say both chains have had to compete with fierce promotions.\n\nStifel Nicholaus analyst Richard Jaffe said that the acquisition means that both companies can lower costs, whether it\u2019s buying shopping bags or buying TV ads. He also noted each could borrow their expertise. He could see Jos. A. Bank selling tuxedos, for instance, or Men\u2019s Wearhouse improving on its sportswear offerings.\n\n\u201cThere are real cost savings and opportunities to turn around the business,\u201d he said.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close by the third quarter.","26":"We're sorry, but the page you were seeking does not exist.

Bank Clothiers, the companies announced today. The two suit-sellers had spent the last five months attempting to buy one another, as well as other, smaller properties in the men\u2019s clothing and apparel sector, in a zigzagging pursuit that was relatively small in dollar terms and big in entertainment value.\n\nMen\u2019s Wearhouse will pay $65 per share for Jos. A. Bank, creating an enterprise with an estimated 1,700 stores and sales of $3.5 billion, the company said in a statement. The two companies\u2019 boards put aside the rancor of the dealmaking process to unanimously approve the cash transaction.\n\nThe most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Jos. A. Bank started the process in October with an offer to buy its larger rival. Men\u2019s Wearhouse brusquely shot that bid down, then mounted what\u2019s known as a \u201cPac-Man defense\u201d by attempting to purchase its former suitor. Jos. A. Bank upped the zaniness factor in February by agreeing to buy Eddie Bauer for $825 million in an effort to make itself too big for Men\u2019s Wearhouse to take on. The Eddie Bauer deal is now canceled, the companies said.\n\nMen\u2019s Wearhouse had lodged a aggressive lawsuit against the Eddie Bauer transaction last month, calling out Jos. A. Bank Chairman Robert Wildrick \u201cand his cronies on the JOSB, comprised principally of Mr. Wildrick\u2019s longtime friends from Palm Beach and people who have worked for him for decades.\u201d\n\nMen\u2019s Wearhouse Chairman Doug Ewert was more diplomatic in today\u2019s press release: \u201cAll of us at Men\u2019s Wearhouse have great respect for the Jos. A. Bank management team and are eager to work with Jos. A. Bank\u2019s talented employees. I am confident that, together, we will create a truly great company for all of our stakeholders.\u201d\n\nThe companies said they expect to save $100 million to $150 million per year from combining operations. Existing Men\u2019s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank stores will keep their branding.\n\nHedge fund Eminence Capital, which owned 4.9 percent of Jos. A. Bank as of Dec. 31 and 9.87 percent of Men\u2019s Wearhouse as of Feb. 24, saw its investments rise on news of the deal. Shares of both companies popped as it was announced:\n\nThe combination pales next to this year\u2019s mergers-and-acquisitions activity, such as Comcast\u2019s $45 billion offer for Time Warner Cable and Facebook\u2019s $19 billion purchase of WhatsApp.","32":"Men's Wearhouse announced Tuesday that it is buying its suit-selling rival Jos. A. Bank for $65 a share in cash after months of wrangling between the two competitors, greatly expanding the size of the menswear chain.\n\nAfter the merger of Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank, the two together will have more than 1,700 stores in the United States, with approximately 23,000 employees and annual sales of about $3.5 billion. The deal totals out at $1.8 billion, with the boards of directors of both companies unanimously approving the transaction.\n\nThe two companies have been attempting to take each other over for months. Jos. A. Bank. sought to acquire Men's Wearhouse for $48 a share, or $2.3 billion in a surprise bid in October, but dropped its offer by mid-November. In December, Men's Wearhouse struck back with $1.5 billion bid that led to the current agreement.\n\nJos. A. Bank board chairman Robert N. Wildrick the final $65-per-share deal was satisfactory to his shareholders. Jos. A. Bank's stock has never traded for the $65 per share, and over the past year\u2014its strongest 12 months\u2014it traded between $40 and $60 per share.\n\n\"The transaction we are announcing today clearly reflects the success of our efforts, providing a substantial premium over any price at which our stock has ever traded, including a 56% premium since our interest in Men's Wearhouse became public last October, and allowing our shareholders to receive immediate consideration for their holdings,\" Wildrick said in a statement.\n\nAs part of the deail, Jos. A. Bank agreed to scrap its agreement with Everest Holdings LLC to buy subsidiary Eddie Bauer.\n\nDespite the contention between the two companies, Men's Wearhouse CEO Doug Ewert struck a conciliatory tone. \"All of us at Men's Wearhouse have great respect for the Jos. A. Bank management team and are eager to work with Jos. A. Bank's talented employees,\" he said.","33":"Sorry, the page you're looking for cannot be found.\n\nThe page may have moved, you may have mistyped the address, or followed a bad link.\n\nVisit our homepage, or search for whatever you were looking for\u2026","34":"The Men's Wearhouse (NYSE: MW) and Jos.

Bank for $65.00 per share in cash, or total consideration of $1.8 billion. The boards of directors of both companies have unanimously approved the transaction.\n\nTogether, Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank will have more than 1,700 stores in the U.S., with approximately 23,000 employees and sales of $3.5 billion on a pro forma basis.\n\n\"We are pleased to have reached this agreement with Jos.

We expect the transaction will be accretive to Men's Wearhouse's earnings in the first full year.\"\n\nMr. Ewert continued, \"The combined company will have the operational flexibility to successfully execute on strategic plans at both brands.

Bank, said, \"Our Board has been rigorously focused on pursuing a path for our shareholders that maximizes value creation. We have been committed to pursuing a range of strategic alternatives to achieve that goal. The transaction we are announcing today clearly reflects the success of our efforts, providing a substantial premium over any price at which our stock has ever traded, including a 56% premium since our interest in Men's Wearhouse became public last October, and allowing our shareholders to receive immediate consideration for their holdings. On behalf of our Board and management team, I would like to express our deep appreciation to our employees for their hard work in making Jos. A. Bank the great company it is today. We look forward to working together with Men's Wearhouse to ensure a smooth transition.\"\n\nStrategic and Financial Benefits of the Combination\n\no Provides compelling value for both companies' shareholders: The combination provides Jos. A. Bank's shareholders immediate liquidity and substantial value for their investment. The transaction represents a 65% premium over Jos. A. Bank's unaffected enterprise value and a 56% premium over Jos. A. Bank's closing share price on October 8, 2013, the day prior to the public announcement of Jos. A. Bank's proposal to acquire Men's Wearhouse. Further, the transaction represents a 10x enterprise value to last twelve months (\"LTM\") Adjusted EBITDA[1] multiple (assuming an estimated $137 million of Adjusted EBITDA for Jos. A. Bank's fiscal 2013 ending February 1, 2014).[2]\n\nMen's Wearhouse shareholders will benefit from approximately $100 to $150 million of run-rate annual synergies realized over three years, through improving purchasing efficiencies, optimizing customer service and marketing practices, and streamlining duplicative corporate functions. Additionally, Men's Wearhouse's vertical direct sourcing model will be leveraged to improve combined merchandising and sourcing across the combined company and rationalize inventory over time.\n\no Combined company positioned to succeed: The combined company will be the fourth largest U.S. men's apparel retailer with pro forma sales of approximately $3.5 billion. This transaction brings together a high-value collection of national and owned brands. Building on the two companies' complementary business models, the combined company will better serve an expanded customer base in more locations and optimize merchandising and sourcing capabilities.\n\no Smooth transition expected: Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank expect a smooth integration, as there will be no rebranding or remodels required \u2013 Jos. A. Bank's store banner will remain in place. In addition, the Men's Wearhouse management team has a proven track record of successful acquisitions, having integrated approximately 600 stores and over 7,000 employees in connection with its previous acquisitions of Joseph Abboud, After Hours and Moores. Men's Wearhouse expects to implement the best practices of both companies to drive further operational and financial success. Management will consist of the most qualified individuals from both organizations.\n\nTerms of the Transaction\n\nMen's Wearhouse will acquire Jos. A. Bank for approximately $1.8 billion in cash. Today, Men's Wearhouse announced that it has extended the expiration date of its tender offer to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Wednesday, March 19, 2014, unless extended. Men's Wearhouse will amend its pending tender offer prior to that expiration date in accordance with, and to reflect, the terms of the Merger Agreement, including to reflect the increase in the purchase price to be offered to $65.00 per share and other changes contemplated by the Merger Agreement between Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank.\n\nJos. A. Bank's Board of Directors unanimously determined that the definitive merger agreement with Men's Wearhouse and the terms of the Men's Wearhouse tender offer are fair to and in the best interests of Jos. A. Bank and its shareholders, and recommends that Jos. A. Bank shareholders tender their Jos. A. Bank shares to Men's Wearhouse. Jos. A. Bank will amend its Schedule 14D-9 previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to reflect the recommendation of its Board of Directors. The transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including the valid tender of sufficient shares, which, when added to shares owned by Men's Wearhouse and its affiliates, constitute a majority of the total number of common shares outstanding on a fully-diluted basis. Any shares not tendered in the offer will be acquired in a second step merger at the same cash price as in the tender offer.\n\nIn conjunction with this transaction, Jos. A. Bank has terminated its agreement to acquire Everest Holdings LLC, the parent company of Eddie Bauer. As a result of the termination of its agreement to purchase Everest Holdings LLC, the terms and conditions of the offer were not satisfied. Effective immediately, Jos. A. Bank is also withdrawing its previously announced tender offer to purchase for cash up to $300 million in value of its common stock.\n\nFinancing and Approvals\n\nThe Men's Wearhouse tender offer is not conditioned on financing, and the Company expects to finance the transaction with a combination of balance sheet cash and committed debt financing from BofA Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The strong free cash flow generated by the combined company is expected to enable rapid deleveraging.\n\nThe transaction, which is expected to close by the third quarter of 2014, is subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act. Both Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank are working cooperatively with the Federal Trade Commission to obtain approval of the transaction as soon as possible.\n\nAdvisors\n\nBofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC are serving as financial advisors to Men's Wearhouse, and Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP is serving as legal advisor.\n\nGoldman, Sachs & Co. and Financo, LLC are serving as financial advisors to Jos.

(NYSE: MW) announced Tuesday morning that it has entered a definitive agreement to acquire Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc. (NASDAQ: JOSB) in an all-cash deal for $65.00 a share, or total consideration of $1.8 billion. The final price is $1.50 per share more than Men\u2019s Wearhouse offered in late February.\n\nThe story began last October when the smaller Jos. A. Bank offered to acquire Men\u2019s Wearhouse for $48 a share, an offer that was rejected and soon withdrawn. Then Men\u2019s Wearhouse offered $55 a share to acquire Jos. A. Bank. As part of that offer, Men\u2019s Wearhouse said that it \u201cexpect[ed] a smooth integration as there will be no rebranding or remodels required \u2014 Jos. A. Bank\u2019s store banner will remain in place. Management will consist of the most qualified individuals from both companies.\u201d\n\nIn the final deal, Men\u2019s Wearhouse kept its bargain, saying there will be no re-branding and that management \u201cwill consist of the most qualified individuals from both companies.\u201d The combined stores will have more than 1,700 locations and pro forma revenue of about $3.5 billion.\n\nMen\u2019s Wearhouse\u2019s offer represents a premium of 56% to Jos. A. Bank\u2019s closing price when the smaller store first made its offer for Men\u2019s Wearhouse. Jos. A. Bank has terminated its agreement to acquire Eddie Bauer as a condition of the merger, which could result in a claim from Bauer\u2019s owner, Everest Holdings. Jos. A. Bank also terminated its previously announced tender offer to purchase up to $300 million worth of its outstanding stock.\n\nThe Men\u2019s Wearhouse tender offer to Jos. A. Bank stockholders has been extended to a new expiration date of March 19, and the cash paid per share has been raised from $63.50 to $65.00. The merger is expected to close in the third quarter of this year, pending required regulatory approvals.\n\nMen\u2019s Wearhouse stock was up about 5.6% at $57.54, after posting a new 52-week high of $58.80 earlier in the morning. The 52-week low is $28.95.\n\nJos. A. Bank shares were up about 3.8% to $64.15, after posting a new high of $64.63. The 52-week low is $38.36.","41":"Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc. was worth far less than Men\u2019s Wearhouse Inc. when Jos. A. Bank Chairman Robert Wildrick launched a $2.3 billion takeover offer for the company. Men\u2019s Wearhouse scoffed, calling the offer \u201copportunistic\u201d and \u201csubject to unacceptable risks and contingencies.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Mr. Wildrick got his combination, at a price that will reward him and his shareholders handsomely. But the buyer is Men\u2019s Wearhouse, not Jos. A. Bank.\n\nThe tie-up, valued at $1.8 billion, ends a six-month war of words between the two suit sellers, one that even drew commentary from comedian Jerry Seinfeld. He quipped about Jos. A. Bank: \u201cCould they advertise more? Could they sell less?\u201d\n\nThe shareholders of both companies are the ones with the last laugh. Men\u2019s Wearhouse said Tuesday it would pay $65 a share for Jos. A. Bank. That\u2019s a premium of about 55% to the share price on Oct. 8, before Jos. A. Bank\u2019s original effort surfaced. Meanwhile, shares of Men\u2019s Wearhouse are up 62% over the same period, showing shareholders of both companies wanted the deal.\n\nThe tie-up, code-named Dapper by Men\u2019s Wearhouse and Suits by Jos. A. Bank, still needs to get past regulators, who are expected to look closely at whether the two big players in men\u2019s suits will have too much market power as a combined company. The Federal Trade Commission previously requested more information from the companies about their possible combination, a signal that the agency plans to take a detailed look at the deal.\n\nShould it be blessed, the new company will have more than 1,700 stores in the U.S., about 23,000 employees and annual sales of some $3.5 billion.\n\nMr. Wildrick studied psychology in college and had planned to pursue a career in the field after being drafted into the army. In an interview in October with The Wall Street Journal, he said \u201cI wanted to be a psychologist or work at a mental hospital, but this deal process is like working in one.\u201d\n\nHe saw a deal as important, however, fearing that Jos. A. Bank had limited growth prospects on its own. The century-old retailer from Hampstead, Md., had proposed in September to buy its larger rival. Mr. Wildrick, from Palm Beach, Fla., personally called Men\u2019s Wearhouse Chief Executive Doug Ewert to relay what was in the letter his board was sending to Mr. Ewert\u2019s.\n\nHe was met with weeks of silence after Mr. Ewert said he would need time to consider the approach.\n\nThe night of Oct. 8 he called Mr. Ewert again, this time in a scramble, according to a person familiar with the call.\n\nReporters had caught wind of the deal. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d asked Mr. Wildrick. The next day Men\u2019s Wearhouse put out a public statement saying that it rejected its rival\u2019s offer.\n\nThat set off a monthslong, often tense, public war of words between the two suit makers, each of whom wanted a combination that most analysts and investors agree makes financial and operational sense and would give rise to significant cost savings. The question was price, and who would run the combined company.\n\nThe tension boiled over last month, when Jos. A. Bank agreed to buy Eddie Bauer, a deal Men\u2019s Wearhouse went to court to stop, calling it a tactic aimed at thwarting the takeover. (Jos. A. Bank is abandoning that purchase as part of its Men\u2019s Wearhouse agreement.) People close to Men\u2019s Wearhouse also said Jos. A. Bank was vastly overpaying for Eddie Bauer.\n\nWhether intentional or not, the move appeared to nudge Men\u2019s Wearhouse into raising its bid for Jos. A. Bank, possibly out of fear that the Eddie Bauer deal would put its quarry out of reach.\n\nIt is unclear who will run the combined company, which will retain both brands. Mr. Wildrick, though, won\u2019t have a role, people familiar with the matter said Tuesday.\n\nThe deal caps 20 years for Mr. Wildrick with Jos. A. Bank. The avid golfer and surfer, who has a 39-foot boat named \u201cThe Intrepid,\u201d joined Jos. A. Bank\u2019s board in 1994 after rising through the ranks at department stores including Belk Inc. and doing a stint as president of Venture Stores Inc.\n\nAround four years ago, as its stock began to stagnate, Jos. A. Bank began scouring for a takeover deal. It compiled a list of potential targets in areas including women\u2019s clothing and active wear. Jos. A. Bank approached more than 20 companies and had serious talks with about half of them, according to a person familiar with the matter. But the talks always fizzled for one reason or another.\n\nMen\u2019s Wearhouse was the \u201clast hurrah\u201d in this effort, according to this person. If the Fremont, Calif., company wasn\u2019t interested, Jos. A. Bank planned a big share buyback, in hopes of lighting a fire under shares that had gone sideways for three years.\n\nMen\u2019s Wearhouse wasn\u2019t on Jos. A. Bank\u2019s target list until the summer of 2013, when Men\u2019s Wearhouse ousted its founder and Chairman George Zimmer in a nasty public boardroom spat. Mr. Wildrick\u2019s bankers at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and retail specialist Financo LLC told him he should take advantage of turbulence at the company and launch a bid.\n\nBut ultimately Jos. A. Bank turned from predator into prey.\n\nWrite to Dana Mattioli at dana.mattioli@wsj.com","42":"\n\nIn October 2013 Jos A Bank Clothiers, Inc made an unsolicited $2.3 billion offer to acquire The Men's Wearhouse, Inc, which precipitated a flurry of competing acquisition offers and takeover defences by the competing clothing retailers.

After Jos A Bank withdrew its offer, Men's Wearhouse's largest stockholder, Eminence Capital, stated publicly that it was in favour of a transaction between the two companies, and that it would seek to vote out certain incumbent Men's Wearhouse directors if no deal occurred. Shortly after Jos A Bank withdrew its offer, Men's Wearhouse dusted off the so-called 'Pac-Man defence', which was a popular takeover defence tactic in the 1980s, and offered to acquire Jos A Bank for $1.5 billion, or $55 per share. Mirroring Men's Wearhouse's prior response, Jos A Bank rejected the offer as insufficient and lowered the trigger on its shareholder rights plan from 20% to 10%. Men's Wearhouse subsequently raised its unsolicited offer to $57.50, and commenced a hostile tender offer for Jos A Bank shares at that price, with the tender offer set to expire on March 28 2014. Eminence Capital has publicly supported Men's Wearhouse's renewed offer, and has stated its intention to nominate two directors to the Jos A Bank's board. As of this update, Jos A Bank's board is considering this new proposal and has requested that its stockholders not participate in the hostile offer until the board determines how to proceed.\n\nFor further information on this topic please contact Peter L Welsh or Jane D Goldstein at Ropes & Gray LLP's Boston office by telephone (+1 617 951 7000), fax (+1 617 951 7050) or email (peter.welsh@ropesgray.com or jane.goldstein@ropesgray.com).

Bank Clothiers Inc. said Tuesday it would merge with rival Men's Wearhouse Inc. in a $1.8 billion deal, closing out a bitter five-month saga less than two weeks after the retailers finally met at the bargaining table.\n\n\n\nUnder the terms of the all-cash deal, Jos. A.

A. Bank Clothiers finally liked the look of Men's Wearhouse's takeover offer as the Hampstead-based retailer accepted a $1.8 billion buyout Tuesday.\n\nThe deal would pay Bank's stockholders $65 a share cash, $10 more than Men's Wearhouse initially offered in November, but their gain could mean more job losses in Maryland, where Bank traces its roots to 1905.\n\nThe combination of the nation's two biggest men's apparel specialty chains would create a $3.5 billion retail powerhouse with 1,700 stores across the United States and about 23,000 employees that analysts said could compete better with department stores and online sellers.\n\nMen's Wearhouse said it would keep the Jos. A. Bank brand, and Bank terminated its recent agreement to acquire outdoor apparel retailer Eddie Bauer.\n\nThe deal ends months of acrimonious tug of war between the two rivals that started when Bank made a surprise $2.3 billion offer to buy Houston-based Men's Wearhouse in September. Spurning Bank's overtures, Men's Wearhouse turned the tables and moved to buy Bank in a series of bids that turned hostile in January.\n\nLeaders of both companies struck much friendlier tones Tuesday after their boards of directors approved the transaction.\n\nMen's Wearhouse CEO Doug Ewert said his chain has \"great respect for the Jos. A. Bank management team and is eager to work with Jos. A. Bank's talented employees. Together, Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank will have increased scale and breadth, and Jos. A. Bank's strong brand and complementary business model will broaden our customer reach.\"\n\nBank Chairman Robert N. Wildrick said the retailer's board has been focused on finding a strategic alternative that would maximize value for shareholders.\n\n\"The transaction we are announcing today clearly reflects the success of our efforts, providing a substantial premium over any price at which our stock has ever traded,\" Wildrick said.\n\nBank's shares rose nearly 4 percent Tuesday, closing at $64.22.\n\nWhile the higher price is a boon to shareholders, it will bring increased pressure to trim expenses, said Steven Isberg, a finance professor at the University of Baltimore's Merrick School of Business.\n\n\"This is a much higher price than originally talked about, and they will not make it back through revenue enhancements,\" he said.\n\nIsberg said all business processes will be on the table for being eliminated, from back-office operations to the supply chain, including reducing the number of distribution faculties.\n\n\"To generate the value they're paying, they're going to have to create some significant cost reductions, more significant than the earlier proposal,\" he said.\n\nThe companies expect expense savings of $100 million to $150 million over three years. The savings are expected to come from more efficient merchandise buying, improved customer service and marketing, and streamlining of corporate functions, they said.\n\nJos. A. Bank employs about 780 people in Carroll County between its headquarters and three distribution centers, making it the county's fourth-largest employer behind the school system and two hospitals.\n\nIt could be months before any decisions are made about the fate of those facilities. Any big changes would be unlikely before the deal closes, which is expected by the third quarter, analysts said.\n\nState economic development officials said Tuesday that it is too early to know how the acquisition might impact Maryland jobs.\n\n\"We are hopeful that it will not have an impact and that those jobs will remain in Maryland,\" said Karen Glenn Hood, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Business and Economic Development. \"We just don't have those details.\"\n\nConsumers probably won't see significant changes.\n\n\"There will be no rebranding or remodels required \u2014 Jos. A. Bank's store banner will remain in place,\" the companies said.\n\nStill, the merger could be tricky, analysts said, as the retailer navigates an increasingly competitive retail climate while trying to become more efficient and combine two disparate corporate cultures yet retain brand identity and customer loyalty.\n\n\"They speak to two different types of customers,\" said Christine Carter, president of Baltimore-based Epps Consulting, a retail marketing firm. \"Jos. A. Bank has more of a mom-and-pop feel, even though it's national, and more intimate relationships, where Men's Wearhouse comes across as a big box, one-size-fits all retailer. The challenge will be retaining the Jos. A. Bank customers.\"\n\nA big challenge will be avoiding losing loyal customers who might perceive the merger as eliminating the brand they favor, said Roy DeYoung, senior vice president for Paradysz PM Digital, a New York-based marketing firm.\n\n\"There could be some customer apprehension about why are they doing this to my brand?\" he said. \"They're going to need to make a statement real soon to the customers \u2014 why we did the deal, what's in it for you, and join us in celebrating. They don't want an exodus.\"\n\nDeYoung said that while a combined chain can expect a bigger share of the growing men's apparel market, it still faces stiff competition, not only from traditional department stores but from a growing number of online-only and catalog retailers.\n\nEach chain will benefit from the other's strengths, said Mark Montagna, a senior research analyst with Avondale Partners LLC, a Nashville-based investment bank. Bank will get a boost for its tuxedo rental business, while Men's Wearhouse will get the advantage of lower costs and higher quality in sourcing products.\n\nThe deal still must be approved by shareholders and will get an antitrust review.\n\n\"It's a slam dunk \u2014 shareholders will approve this,\" Montagna said. \"I think it's a good deal. It's a positive for shareholders of both companies.\"\n\nMontagna said he doubted that the merger would be held up by antitrust issues because the combined company would represent only about 5 percent of the total menswear business.","46":"The Men's Wearhouse (MW) and Jos.

The photographs of the three objects, the largest of which measures around 24 metres by 22 metres, were taken on Sunday, the day after the plane vanished, but were only published on Wednesday. The wingspan of the missing Boeing 777 is around 61 metres. The satellite images place the objects 150 miles (250km) or so from the aircraft's last known position over the South China Sea and 250 miles from an oil rig on which a worker reported seeing a burning object in the sky on Saturday morning.\n\nHe also urged Malaysia to step up search efforts, saying: \"The Chinese government has asked relevant parties to enhance co-ordination, investigate the cause, locate the missing plane as quickly as possible and properly handle all related matters.\"\n\nEarlier, China's foreign ministry complained that there was \"too much confusion\" regarding information released about the plane's flight path.\n\nThe plane vanished late on Friday, about an hour after it took off from Kuala Lumpur.\n\nNo distress signal or message was sent from the flight, which was carrying 153 Chinese nationals among its passengers.\n\nEarlier, Malaysian authorities revealed that the last communication from the jet suggested everything was normal on board.\n\nFlight MH370 replied \"All right, roger that\" to a radio message from Malaysian air control, authorities said. Minutes later all contact with the plane was lost.","57":"Beijing: Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said on Thursday that Beijing has \u201czero tolerance\u201d for corruption however senior the culprit, as the country\u2019s leaders press forward with a much-publicised anti-graft campaign.\n\nBut he did not address reports that one of the ruling Chinese Communist Party\u2019s former top officials may be under investigation, telling his once-a-year press conference only that \u201ceverybody is equal before the law\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe will show zero tolerance to those corrupt behaviours and corrupt officials,\u201d Li said at the close of the annual session of the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC), China\u2019s rubber-stamp legislature.\n\n\u201cChina is a country that is under the rule of law,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cNo matter who he is and how senior his position is, if he violates party discipline and law of the country, he will be seriously dealt with and punished to the full extent of the law, because everybody is equal before the law.\u201d\n\nReporters attending the annual event are normally required to submit their questions in advance.\n\nNeither Li nor any of the selected questioners mentioned Zhou Yongkang, the former domestic security tsar and member of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), China\u2019s most powerful body, who is widely rumoured to be under investigation.\n\nIf the Zhou probe is confirmed it would be the first time in decades that such a high-ranking figure has been targeted in a formal inquiry, and would send shockwaves through China\u2019s elite.\n\nPSC members have generally been regarded as untouchable even after retirement.\n\nNews outlets were warned by the Chinese Foreign Ministry not to ask questions about Zhou at the press conference or \u201cthey would face being blacklisted from asking questions in the future\u201d, Hong Kong\u2019s South China Morning Post reported Thursday.\n\nIn his remarks on corruption, Li made apparent reference to the motivational book, Who Moved My Cheese?, a US best-seller that counsels businesspeople on how to adapt to change.\n\n\u201cIn the course of reform, the vested interests will be shaken, and some people\u2019s cheese will be moved, so to speak,\u201d Li said.\n\n\u201cFor example, in the course of power delegation, some government departments will find fewer powers in their own hands, and in boosting market competition and easing market access, some existing companies will feel greater pressure.\u201d\n\nLi also addressed China\u2019s environmental challenges, returning to his rhetoric last week that China would \u201cdeclare war\u201d on pollution.\n\n\u201cTo declare a war against smog doesn\u2019t mean that we are going to declare a war against nature,\u201d Li said.\n\n\u201cRather, what we mean is that we are going to declare a war against our own inefficient and unsustainable model of growth and way of life.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cthose overseeing agencies that turn a blind eye to polluting activities and fail to perform their duties of overseeing will be held accountable\u201d.\n\nAs China faces rising tensions with its Asian neighbours \u2014 particularly Japan \u2014 over a series of maritime disputes, Li asserted Beijing\u2019s \u201cunshakeable will\u201d in safeguarding its territorial sovereignty.\n\n\u201cWhen neighbours interact with each other, it\u2019s only natural that sometimes they will run into problems of one kind or another,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut as long as they respect each other, properly manage differences and pursue mutual benefit, there will be harmonious sounds instead of jarring noises.\u201d","58":"BEIJING--China will be able to keep economic growth in a reasonable range in 2014, Premier Li Keqiang said Thursday.\n\n\"Currently we see more difficulties [than last year]...but the Chinese economy has great potential and resilience,\" Mr. Li said at a news conference on the closing day of Beijing's annual National People's Congress.\n\nMr. Li didn't make any specific projection on economic growth on Thursday but the government has set a target of about a 7.5% increase in gross domestic product for this year, which is far below the double-digit growth levels of recent years.

Last year, we promulgated ten measures to control air pollution and monitor PM2.5 in 161 cities. On one hand, it aims to improve people's awareness, on the other hand, it urges related authorities to take their responsibilities more seriously.\" Li further explained to the press.\n\nThe government says it will severely punish those who emit pollutants illegally. Likewise, supervising authorities must be accountable if they turn a blind eye on polluting activities or fail to perform their duties.\n\n\"It takes time to tackle this problem, but we can't wait for wind and rain to drive smog away. I hope that our government, businesses and each and every individual will act together and make persistent efforts to win this battle.\" Li said.","62":"China\u2019s rapid growth has dragged hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. But it\u2019s also had one very nasty side effect \u2013 a massive increase in pollution.\n\nUntil recently, most Chinese were happy to accept more pollution in return for faster growth. In any case, the political system left them with little choice.\n\nBut over the past few years there have been increasing protests about conditions. And with growth now slowing, people will have more time to get angry about the downsides of the country\u2019s economic transformation.\n\nA popular revolt is the last thing the communist leadership wants. So last week, premier Li Keqiang declared a \u201cwar on pollution\u201d.\n\nThis will have a major impact on several industries. So how can you profit?\n\nA pack-a-day cigarette habit \u2013 even for non-smokers\n\nChina\u2019s most visible problem is its poor air quality. The problem is that China gets over two-thirds of its energy from coal.\n\nCoal plants emit a lot of sulphur and soot. When this combines with vehicle exhaust and pollution from factories, it produces smog. According to official statistics, all but three cities in the whole of China breach international air quality standards.\n\nNowhere is this problem more obvious than in Beijing, China\u2019s capital, which is regularly covered in smog for days at a time. During the last spell, which blanketed even the tallest buildings, flights had to be cancelled and factories shut. Similar problems have also been seen in Shanghai, which recently even took the unprecedented step of closing schools.\n\nThings are so bad that some Chinese people wear protective masks, ranging from simple paper filters to industrial grade respirators, as they go about their day-to-day lives. And you can hardly blame them. The World Health Organisation reckons that in 2010, poor air quality contributed to the early deaths of 1.2 million Chinese citizens. And a study by Professor Michael Greenstone of MIT suggests that the effects of living with all that pollution are similar to smoking a packet of cigarettes a day.\n\nThe air is bad, but the water is worse\n\nChina\u2019s air is obviously bad, and a very visible sign of pollution. But experts think its water may be even worse. Thanks to lax or non-existent controls, firms discharge all sorts of waste into rivers without treating it first.\n\nAs a result, over half of China\u2019s rivers are classed as \u2018poor\u2019 or \u2018very poor\u2019. A fifth are considered toxic. Even ministers call it \u201cgrim\u201d.\n\nAs with the polluted air, this is having a serious impact on the cities, towns and villages who depend on the water for drinking and washing. One of the most notorious cases is the river Huai. This river is so polluted that villagers living next to its tributaries can\u2019t open their windows because of the smell. They can\u2019t even use the water to irrigate their crops \u2013 it poisons them.\n\nThe Huai, and other rivers just as bad, has also been held responsible for a string of \u2018cancer villages\u2019, where rates of the disease are far above the norm. Water pollution has also been linked with birth defects and mutations.\n\nAlongside air pollution, it is responsible for the third of Chinese children with high levels of lead in their blood \u2013 which has been linked with learning problems and criminal behaviour.\n\nThe other problem is that China already has too little water to go around. The fact that a large part of its supply is unusable has made this problem far worse. In 200 cities, water shortages are a critical problem.\n\nFixing the problem \u2013 and how to profit\n\nSo what will the \u2018war on pollution\u2019 involve?\n\nChina admits that the problem may take over a decade to solve. But it has already started to tackle the problem, with a major programme announced last year.\n\nFirstly, there will be tougher standards and bigger penalties for polluters who break them. Secondly, there will be more spending on anti-pollution infrastructure, such as \u2018scrubbers\u2019 for power plants.\n\nIt seems likely that China will follow through on this, too. Apart from worries over popular uprisings, even the most corrupt government official can\u2019t relish the idea of waking up in a penthouse swathed in smog, or of sending their child out to school with a gas mask in their school bag.\n\nThere are several ways to profit, and we\u2019ll be looking at them in more detail in MoneyWeek magazine in the near future (if you\u2019re not already a subscriber, you can get your first three issues free here).\n\nBut there\u2019s one quite obvious play that we\u2019ve covered a few times recently \u2013 and you don\u2019t have to invest in Chinese stocks to benefit from it. The government plans to spend a lot more on nuclear power to reduce reliance on coal. That\u2019s set to have a knock-on effect on uranium prices (which are still at a pretty low ebb). Uranium is also set to benefit from increased Indian interest, and Japan restarting its nuclear power plants. One way to profit is through uranium miner Cameco (NYSE: CCJ), which has large reserves.\n\n\u2022 This article is taken from our free daily investment email, Money Morning.

To say this is a real press conference is something of an overstatement \u2014 like all government events, it is stage-managed, with all questions carefully vetted and selected in advance. But it is still a rare opportunity to at least hear directly from the otherwise unapproachable Chinese leadership. And though Li offered few details (as usual) and his language was vague (as usual), he did indicate that the government\u2019s attitude toward the economy is changing in extremely important ways for the nation\u2019s future.\n\nHere we can find good news in the Premier\u2019s bad news. The substance of Li\u2019s comments suggested that China is heading for a rough patch, but he and his policy team are not going to pump it up at all costs. \u201cWe are not pursuing GDP growth alone,\u201d he declared . This is an especially meaningful statement. In the past, China\u2019s government felt compelled to supersize growth rates as soon as the economy showed any signs of faltering, as they did after the 2008 global financial crisis. But that has led to all sorts of problems for the economy \u2014 rising levels of debt, a shaky financial system and unhealthy excess capacity. Economists almost universally agree that Beijing has to start balancing its desire for growth with tough reforms to fix the negative fallout from that growth. In that way, China\u2019s economy would be set upon a more stable future.\n\nLi indicated that the days of blindly building GDP are over. Though he confessed that \u201cChina's economy still faces severe challenges this year,\u201d he went on to admit that \u201cthe space for wielding fiscal and monetary policy has limits, and [macroeconomic] regulation certainly faces many hard choices.\u201d Instead, Li acknowledged that the economy has serious problems that must be addressed \u2014 terrible pollution, too much debt, inefficiency \u2014 and that the government needs to strike a balance between ensuring economic expansion and repairing its weaknesses. \u201cWe need to face up to the difficulties and challenges and make the most of the favorable conditions,\u201d Li said . \"Only a sharpened ax can cut through firewood.\"\n\nHowever, the question he left open is: How sharp is his ax? Li\u2019s prudent comments are exactly what economists and investors want to hear \u2014 that Beijing will start to prioritize reform to set the stage for healthier growth rather than sacrificing everything for growth. Yet how committed are they to that course? Some economists are forecasting growth rates well below the government\u2019s 7.5% target. How far will Li and his team allow growth to slip? Li left open the possibility that the government would jump in. \"The acceptable lowest limit of GDP growth needs to ensure enough employment and that people's incomes are increasing,\" he said.\n\nIf the economy continues to slow over the course of 2014, Beijing may have to make a difficult choice \u2014 growth or reform \u2014 that will likely shape the direction of the economy for years to come. So, as usual, Li told people what they wanted to hear. We\u2019ll have to see if he means it.","70":"Amid growing tensions with its neighbours over territorial disputes, Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday said China has an unshakable will to safeguard its sovereignty but at the same time would enhance common interests and narrow differences with neighbouring countries.\n\nChina at present is involved in maritime disputes with several of its neighbours in the South China Sea and with Japan over the disputed islands in the East China Sea, besides the long standing border dispute with India.\n\n\"China has unwavering commitment to pursuing peaceful development and unshakable will in safeguarding its sovereignty and territorial integrity, both for the sake of upholding stability and creating a favourable environment for its development,\" Li said addressing a press conference at the end of the annual parliamentary session ended.\n\n\"When neighbours interact with each other, it is only natural that sometimes they will run into problems of some kind or another,\" Li said.\n\n\"As long as they respect each other, properly manage differences and pursue mutual benefits, there will be harmonious sound instead of jarring noises,\" he said responding to a question on his visits to several neighbouring countries after he took power last year.\n\nLi visited India first to show the importance Chinese leadership attached to bilateral relations followed by Pakistan and other countries.\n\nHis visit was reciprocated by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh making 2013 a rare year when premiers of both countries\n\nvisited each other in the same year.\n\nDuring his annual press meet today, Li recalled his visit to Vietnam while references to India were conspicuously absent in his response to the question on China's relations with neighbours.\n\nLi said peace and friendship and peaceful coexistence represent common aspirations of all people in China and its neighbouring countries, he said.\n\nAs a developing country, China needs a favourable neighbouring and international environment for its modernisation drive, he said.

A Wall Street Journal consensus estimate had pegged industrial production to expand at 9.5 percent and retail sales to grow at 13.5 percent.\n\nAnalysts at Societe Generale attributed the fall in retail sales to \u201canti-corruption drive and disinflation\u201d while pinning the slowing of industrial production on rising inventories, according to MarketWatch.\n\nEarlier, Premier Li Keqiang reportedly gave his vote of confidence to the future of the Chinese economy at a press conference to mark the conclusion of the National People\u2019s Congress.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese economy has great potential and resilience.

The Hang Seng index, which had rallied to trade up 0.5 percent subsequently fell to trade down 0.4 percent.","78":"Chinese Premier Li Keqiang signalled on Thursday that Beijing was willing to accept some debt defaults in the world's second-largest economy as it struggles to clean up its multi-trillion-dollar \"shadow banking\" sector.\n\nHis comments come after the country's first-ever default on a domestic corporate bond last week and as investors grow worried that other firms could follow suit.\n\nLi said authorities \"pay very high attention\" to financial and debt risks, as he held his once-a-year news conference after the close of the annual session of the National People's Congress (NPC), the Communist Party-controlled legislature.\n\nHe could not possibly \"want to see\" defaults on financial products, he said at the Great Hall of the People.\n\n\"But I'm afraid sometimes certain individual cases of such defaults are hardly avoidable,\" he added.\n\nShanghai-based Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co. said Friday it was unable to make bond interest payments of 89.8 million yuan ($14.7 million), sending it into a landmark default.\n\nAnd on Tuesday power equipment maker Baoding Tianwei Baobian Electric Co. said its bonds would be suspended from trading after it posted two consecutive years of losses.\n\nHowever, analysts said the Chaori default could benefit the market in the long term by raising awareness of risk and making investors more selective.\n\n\"Allowing Chaori to default on its bond was in fact an obvious sign that the government has started to make some adjustments (in policy),\" said Zhou Hao, Shanghai-based economist for ANZ Bank.\n\n\"Previously, it wanted to avoid defaults, but now it hopes to rely more on market-oriented measures to ease some risk,\" he told AFP.\n\nRatings agency Moody's said: \"We believe the default will spur needed development in the onshore bond market.\"\n\n\"The lack of intervention is consistent with the central Chinese government's adoption of more market-oriented policies, which include increased tolerance for corporate bond defaults, as it reforms the country's financial markets,\" it said.\n\nEarly this year, worries surfaced in China over other financial products issued by trust companies, which have drawn comparisons to American \"junk bonds\" of the 1980s.\n\nIn one case, a $160 million investment product structured by Jilin Province Trust and backed by a coal firm failed to make capital and interest payments.\n\nSeparately, a $500 million investment product structured by China Credit Trust avoided default in January after an unknown party made good on principal payments to hundreds of investors, though they did not received pledged interest.\n\nSuch products are part of a murky \"shadow banking\" system -- a vast network of lending outside formal channels and beyond the reach of regulators. They include activities by online finance platforms, credit guarantee companies and microcredit firms.\n\nThe \"shadow banking\" sector was as large as $4.8 trillion in 2012, more than half the country's gross domestic product, according to a previous estimate by Moody's.\n\nLi said authorities have a grip on financial risks to the economy and played down worries over huge debts run up by local governments which have splurged on infrastructure and other investments.\n\nSome local authorities, which have long used debt to fuel economic growth in their regions, have pursued projects that are economically unviable or unsustainable.\n\n\"What we should do is to step up monitoring, properly handle relevant measures and be sure that there will be no regional and systemic financial risks,\" Li said.\n\nIn late December, China revealed in a long-awaited debt audit that liabilities carried by local governments had ballooned to 17.9 trillion yuan as of the end of June 2013.\n\nThe figure, released by the National Audit Office, compared with 10.7 trillion yuan at the end of 2010 -- an increase of 67 percent.\n\n\"We have released to the public the results of this comprehensive audit as it is, and the result shows that the risks are on the whole under control,\" Li said.","79":"Premier Li Keqiang vowed to build a sound social security net for the public, including an integrated pension arrangement for rural and urban residents.\n\nMore than 800 million of China's populace are covered by different pension programs, Li said.\n\nThe government will gradually enhance the pension level and merge scattered pension arrangements to promote equal access to social welfare, he said.\n\nThe government will also work harder to provide assistance and help for underprivileged social groups, including those who experience difficulty after being hit by natural disasters or disease, he added.","80":"The page has moved to: this page","81":"Premier Li Keqiang was positive about the Chinese economy's growth potential this year and confident with the government's ability to deal with challenges ahead.\n\nIn the press conference this morning presided over by Li during the on-going annual conference of the National People's Congress, one third of the media's questions were about the economy and financial sector and reform.\n\nA Reuters reporter asked what were the biggest challenges to realize the 7.7 percent economic growth last year and what are the pressing issues for Li to solve now?\n\n\"The downward pressure for Chinese economic growth is the largest challenge last year,\" Li said.\n\nThe central government's revenue even registered a negative growth.

This is not going to be easy,\" Li acknowledged.\n\n\"We need to face up to the difficulties and challenges and make the most of the favorable conditions. This holds the secret of our success,\" he said, citing a Chinese proverb that \"only a sharpened axe can cut through firewood.\"\n\nAlthough China's 7.5 percent growth target is the same as previous years, its importance is fading as many believe the government will no longer view the figure as the necessary minimum as it usually did in the past.\n\nSenior leaders and officials have on various occasions backed up the macro-economic control strategy featuring the idea of \"a proper range,\" -- a lower limit to ensure steady growth and job creation and an upper limit to avert inflation, which was first proposed by Li in July.\n\nFinance minister Lou Jiwei joined the chorus last Thursday, calling for more comprehensive understanding on the country's growth target instead of merely fixating on the 7.5-percent figure.\n\nGDP growth, inflation and employment are all key factors that should be taken into consideration when assessing economic conditions, Lou told a press conference, adding that a growth of 7.3 percent or 7.2 percent can still be counted within that range.","83":"BEIJING, March 13 -- Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday said that his government will give a priority to the promotion of social fairness and the improvement of people's livelihood.\n\n\n\n\"We need to meet people's basic living needs, to provide the last resort for people to fall back on in case of special difficulty, and to promote social fairness,\" Li said at a press conference shortly after the conclusion of China's annual legislative session, calling them three major tasks for the government this year.\n\n\n\n\"Those topics related to people's livelihood presents priority on the government's work agenda,\" he said.\n\n\n\nLi said the government will endeavor to make China's medical insurance and basic old insurance schemes \"truly portable and transferrable\" to further expand their coverage in urban and rural areas.\n\n\n\nThe government is going to explore the possibility of raising the basic pension benefits at a proper time, he said.\n\n\n\nThe premier urged all the government employees to put the special needs of the people, such as those who run into special difficulty because of serious illnesses or sudden disasters, on the top of their mind.\n\n\n\n\"The government needs to take more effective measures to ensure equal opportunities in finding jobs and to level the playing field for people who want to start their own business,\" Li said.\n\n\n\nHe also said that the government needs to pay particular attention to education to ensure fairness at the very starting point.\n\n\n\n\"This year we have set the target of raising the proportion of rural students from poor areas enrolled in key universities and colleges by over 10 percent,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe premier also vowed to further improve the poorly built and low performing schools in China's poor areas.\n\n\n\n\"The government needs to create conditions to ensure that each and every individual has an equal shot at a better life through hard work and that fairness and justice are truly realized even at the most primary level of society,\" he said.","84":"2014\/03\/13 16:01\n\nBEIJING, March 13 (Yonhap) -- Chinese Premier Li Keqiang urged the United States on Thursday to focus on mutual interests, admitting some \"frictions\" in their bilateral ties amid tensions with Washington over Beijing's increasingly assertive naval reach in Asia and maritime disputes with its neighbors.\n\nSpeaking at his annual press conference, Li, however, gave a relatively upbeat assessment about the prospect of the relationship between the world's top two economies and militaries, saying, \"There is much more that we can do to further unleash the potential of China-U.S. cooperation.

Under the leadership of President Xi Jinping and Premier Li, China has launched an anti-corruption crackdown that has netted hundreds of wayward officials. President Xi has promised to nab both lowly \u201cflies\u201d and high-ranking \u201ctigers.\u201d If Zhou, he of the Mafioso slicked-back hair and steely gaze, is indeed probed, he would be the mightiest tiger to be felled in decades. After all, he was a member of China\u2019s elite ruling circle: the then nine (now seven) men of the party\u2019s Standing Committee who determine the course of the People\u2019s Republic.\n\nOver the past year, a slew of officials high and low who worked under Zhou in three main spheres \u2014 the state-owned oil industry, the populous province of Sichuan and the Public Security Ministry \u2014 have been detained. His son and top aides have been implicated in nefarious financial dealings. Zhou himself may be under house arrest. All of which led some China-watchers to expect that Premier Li would use a pre-approved question at his press conference to at least indirectly refer to the state\u2019s possible case against Zhou.\n\nLi did not. In an annual press conference remarkably devoid of actual news, the Premier did take on a question about corruption; it was the third one asked of him and was lobbed Li\u2019s way by a reporter from the online arm of People\u2019s Daily , the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s mouthpiece. Li\u2019s voice took on a stern tone as he swore \u201czero tolerance\u201d for corrupt cadres. He vowed that no matter \u201chow senior his position is [corrupt officials] will be severely dealt with and punished to the full extent of the law.\u201d Li promised that \u201ceveryone is equal before the law.\u201d But, despite the People\u2019s Daily reporter asking specifically whether there was anything systemic that could be changed, Li declined to tout an easy tool to combat corruption among party ranks: asset disclosure. Granted, releasing such financial information is a rather touchy subject in a political culture where profiting from power is almost expected.\n\nMore importantly, no names \u2014 certainly not Zhou\u2019s \u2014 were named. Two years ago, at the final press conference by outgoing Premier Wen Jiabao, he launched a not-so-oblique attack on Bo Xilai, the former party chief of the southwestern metropolis of Chongqing and an aspirant to the Standing Committee. One day after Wen\u2019s press conference, the Bo purge began. It was a dramatic downfall that involved a poisoned British businessman, a murderous wife and a cache of absconded public funds. Bo\u2019s case turned into China\u2019s biggest political scandal in decades. (Zhou was considered to have been Bo\u2019s political patron.)\n\nAs the minutes ticked by in Li\u2019s presser, expectations rose. After all, former Premier Wen had dispatched his tirade aimed at Bo toward the end of his press conference. Before answering his penultimate question, Li noted that it was time for lunch. Journalists must be hungry. A question followed on China\u2019s trading relations with Europe \u2014 specifically to do with high-speed rails, nuclear power and solar panels. Then came the last question, the subject of which I\u2019ve frankly forgotten. Suffice it to say it was not about Mr. Zhou. Reporters were dismissed for lunch.\n\nOn Weibo, China\u2019s lively although occasionally censored microblogging service, people digested the press conference. One popular strain of commentary wondered why no mention had been made of Zhou. Wrote one Weibo user: \u201cI\u2019m very puzzled, why did the journalists, especially the foreign journalists, not cherish their opportunity to ask questions? Don\u2019t they know Master Kang is the most delicious one?\u201d (Zhou\u2019s name is blocked on Weibo searches so Chinese online use creative nicknames like Master Kang to evade the state censors.) Apparently the Weibo commenters were not aware of the scripted ritual. In fact, in a meeting with a senior Chinese official some weeks back, some of us in the foreign press community had already been warned that a question on Zhou was verboten.\n\nMeanwhile, the day before Li\u2019s press conference began, a bloodied man was found dead in the stairwell of a securities\u2019 firm off Beijing\u2019s Financial Street, one of the Chinese capital\u2019s business areas. Police said the man had ended his own life with a knife. His will was discovered. The dead man, according to Chinese media reports, is related to a former secretary to a senior leader currently under investigation. The Chinese press did not name the disgraced politician but he appears to be none other than Zhou Yongkang.\n\n\u2014with reporting by Gu Yongqiang\/Beijing","88":"Useragent Blocked\n\nYour user agent has been blocked from this site.

economic growth lower than its stated target of 7.5 per cent and signalled the government is comfortable with the \"hardly avoidable\" prospect of debt defaults within the nation's risky shadow banking sector.\n\nSpeaking at the closing press conference of the National People's Congress in Beijing on Thursday, China's No.2 leader said he was confident in the health of the country's economy, and that bearish talk of a 'hard landing' had consistently been proven wrong.\n\nMr Li conceded the \"downward pressure\" on the economy was the toughest challenge he faced last year, and said the challenge may prove even harder this time round as China continues to push through a painstaking restructuring of its economy.\n\n\"There is no denying we may encounter a more complex situation this year,\" he said, raising the difficult balancing act of maintaining jobs growth, keeping inflation in check, alleviating environmental problems, all while improving the efficiency and quality of China's economic growth.\n\n\"We need to strike a proper balance among all these goals and objectives.\"\n\nMr Li also ruled out pumping short-term financial stimulus into the economy to artificially inflate growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Without taking any additional short term stimulus measures we succeeded in meeting our [economic growth] targets last year,\" he said. \"Why can't we do that this year?\"\n\nHe said despite some domestic resistance, Chinese banks would not get a lower reserve requirement ratio to allow more credit to flow into the market.\n\n\"This is a must for us,\" he said. \"We do not want to let today's stepping stone become tomorrow's stumbling block.\"\n\nWeak Chinese economic data has triggered steep falls in iron ore and copper prices this week, amid heightened concerns about financial stresses in China's so-called shadow-banking sector, and reports of steel mills struggling to repay their debts.\n\nAlso on Thursday, China released data showing industrial production grew at its slowest pace for more than four years during January and February, while retail sales and fixed asset investment were significantly lower than expected.\n\nIron ore prices have dropped 10 per cent in the past week on fresh fears of weakening Chinese demand and tighter credit conditions in an already cash-strapped domestic steel industry.\n\n\"Heightened speculative activity in Chinese steel prices has accentuated the iron ore price declines and while sentiment remains weak, we can't discount further price falls,\" ANZ's head of commodity strategy, Mark Pervan, said in a research note.\n\nChinese retail investors have in recent years piled into wealth management products that fund borrowers the nation's banks shy away from.\n\nChinese retail investors have in recent years piled into its so-called shadow banking sector, including higher-return wealth management products that fund borrowers the nation's banks shy away from.\n\nOne reason the country's $1.2 trillion trust market has grown so large is a widespread belief the government and state-run banking sector will not allow the companies whose loans back the wealth products to fail.\n\nBut in January, a Chinese financial trust product narrowly avoided default when it was bailed out at the last minute, avoiding what some western analysts had feared could have triggered a Lehman Brothers-like domino effect on the global economy.\n\nMr Li said while China paid \"very high attention to financial and debt risks\" he believed defaults were probably unavoidable, but that it was unlikely to result in \"regional and systemic\" risks.\n\n\"How can I possibly want to see such defaults?\" he said. \"But I'm afraid that some individual cases of such defaults are hardly avoidable.\"\n\n\"What we should do is to step up monitoring, handle matters in time, and ensure that there are no regional and systemic financial risks.\"\n\nIn his first government work report delivered to the NPC as Premier last week, Mr Li said China would aim for economic growth of \"about 7.5 per cent\", which prompted some analysts to express concern that China was not determined enough to sacrifice short term economic growth in order to push through reforms that will help restructure the economy away from its current over-reliance on investment and credit.\n\n\"The 'about' shows there's a level of flexibility here,\" Mr Li said on Thursday, while declining to provide what he believed was a lower threshold of acceptable growth. While he said the focus of the Chinese government was to improve the quality of economic development rather than growth for growth's sake, he said the GDP figures needed to provide for an additional 16 million to 17 million jobs per year.\n\nFinance Minister Lou Jiwei has also previously indicated that economic growth of 7.2 per cent or 7.3 per cent would be acceptable, as long as unemployment didn't spike.\n\n\"What we care more about is the livelihood of our people behind the GDP growth figure, and the employment of people behind GDP growth,\" Mr Li said.","95":"Read more in Special Coverage:\n\n\n\nChina and the United States should expand common interests while respecting each other's core interests and major concerns and properly managing differences to raise the level of bilateral relationship, Premier Li Keqiang said hin Beijing Thursday.The Sino-US relationship is in essence the one between the largest developing country and the largest developed country in the world, Li told a press conference after the conclusion of the annual legislative session.Last year, President Xi Jinping and President Barack Obama had a meeting in California and reached consensus of building a new model of major-country relationship between China and the United States.The new model of relationship has a defining feature of non-conflict and win-win cooperation, Li said.Due to different historical and cultural backgrounds and development stages, it is natural for the two countries to have some differences on certain matters and frictions in cooperation, but these are just \"pains\" amid growing cooperation, Li said.\"As long as the two sides respect each other's core interests and major concerns, properly manage their differences and engage in equal consultations, and in particular, continue to expand their common interests, the two countries will be able to further raise the level of their relationship,\" said Li.The common interests between China and the United States far outweigh their differences, said Li, adding the volume of bilateral trade registered over 520 billion US dollars last year.\"There is much more that we can do to further unleash the potential of Sino-US cooperation. We need to make the most of our complementarity,\" said Li.\"The wise people will seek their common interests, while the unwise ones will focus on their differences,\" said Li,citing a Chinese saying.Whatever change may take place, it should be conducive to both countries and the sound and steady development of Sino-US ties, said Li.\"China and the US need to focus more on common ground in pursuit of long-term benefits,\" Li said.","96":"Read more in Special Coverage:\n\n\n\nChinese Premier Li Keqiang said Thursday that fiscal, tax and financial reforms had been set as a priority on the country's overall reform agenda in 2014.\"In the course of comprehensively deepening reform, we certainly need to be focused on key reforms and initiatives and we need to see breakthroughs in key areas,\" Li said.\"We will press ahead with fiscal, tax and financial reforms as our priorities this year,\" said the premier at a press conference shortly after the conclusion of China's annual legislative session.The authorities will continue to streamline administration and delegate power to ensure that the market fully play its role in an effective and well-regulated manner, he said.The premier also listed reforms in other areas, including taking new steps to ease the tax burden of micro-and-small businesses, deepening reforms of state-owned enterprises, and vigorously developing mixed-ownership economy.Market access would also be eased, especially in the service sectors, such as healthcare, old-age support and financial services, so as to bring greater competition in the market, he said.\"The ultimate goal of all the reforms is to fully energize the market and the creativity of society,\" said the premier.He warned that, \"In the course of reforms, the vested interests will be shaken and some people's cheese will be moved.\"However, the country would \"carry out the reforms without hesitation\" in order to further release the dividends of reform and bring greater benefits to the people, he added.Since last year, the State Council had convened 40 executive meetings, 30 of which were directly related to reform topics, according to the premier.","97":"Read more in Special Coverage:\n\n\n\nChina and the European Union (EU) can work out a solution to their trade disputes through mutual respect and proper consultations, said Premier Li Keqiang in Beijing on Thursday.Being each other's biggest trading partners, it is natural that the two come across some trade frictions, said Li at a press conference held after the annual parliamentary session ended.\"As long as the two sides respect each other and engage in proper consultations, problems can be solved,\" Li said, citing last year's trade dispute case of photovoltaic products as a successful example.Trade disputes are individual cases and account for a small percentage in the two-way trade, he added.Both China and EU are strong advocators of multipolar world and greater investment facilitation, so it is an irresistible trend that companies from the two sides enter each other's market and invest mutually, he said.Li expected that China and EU can carry on the negotiation of an investment treaty in a fair, reciprocal and facilitating way, so that there will be greater mutual investment and deeper economic integration between the two sides.Speaking of the export to EU, Li promoted China's equipment industry at the press conference, saying that Chinese companies can deliver the equipment for building high-speed railways and nuclear plants in the fastest way and at the minimum cost.China is upgrading its economy, including the export, he said.\"We can't just export toys, apparel and shoes,\" he said.The export of Chinese equipment is mutually beneficial for all partners, he said, adding that Chinese producers can test and improve their products through international competition while many Chinese equipment have components outsourced globally and use technologies bought abroad.","98":"Read more in Special Coverage:\n\n\n\nPremier Li Keqiang on Thursday called for new progress in relations between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan.At a press conference following the conclusion of the annual parliamentary session, Li said people-to-people exchanges and business cooperation are important components of ties across the Taiwan Strait.\"I hope to see even greater, new progress in cross-Strait ties this year,\" Li said.Li said a record 8 million visits were recorded between the mainland and Taiwan last year, adding that he wished such good momentum could be kept in the future.He also hoped that follow-up talks on implementing the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), a wide-ranging cross-Strait economic pact signed in 2010, could bear fruit earlier, \"so that greater benefits can be delivered to people and businesses of both sides.\"Li noted that press from both the mainland and Taiwan selected the Chinese character \"jin\" - or \"progress\" in English - as their respective word of the year.\"This (selection) shows the trend of peaceful development of cross-Strait ties and represents the common wish of people on both sides,\" Li said.","99":"Chinese President Xi Jinping (left) and Chinese Premier Li Keqiand arrive for the closing ceremony of the annual National People's Congress in Beijing on Thursday.\n\nmore-in\n\nChina's Premier Li Keqiang said Thursday during his annual interaction with the media that his government wanted to build a \u201cfavourable\u201d neighbouring environment and narrow differences with neighbours, amid recently flaring territorial disputes.\n\nMr. Li said China had an \u201cunshakeable will\u201d in safeguarding its territory and sovereignty, but at the same time also had \u201can unwavering commitment\u201d to ensuring a peaceful periphery.\n\n\u201cAs a developing country, China needs a favorable neighbouring and international environment for its modernisation,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen neighbours interact with each other, it is only natural that sometimes they will run into problems of some kind or another. As long as they respect each other, properly manage differences and pursue mutual benefits, there will be harmonious sound instead of jarring noises.\u201d\n\nHe cited the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence or Panchsheel \u2014 an idea jointly put forward by India and China \u2014 as defining China's neighbourhood diplomacy. His comments come amid rising concerns among many of China's neighbours about its assertiveness over several territorial disputes. China is currently involved in boundary disputes with India; with Japan over disputed East China Sea islands and with a number of countries over the South China Sea.\n\nOver the past year, tensions with Japan have risen over disputed islands and over questions of wartime history, with ties between the two countries simmering in recent months.\n\nChina has, however, sought to tone down disputes over the South China Sea and with India. Mr. Li visited India last year \u2014 his first overseas visit since taking office \u2014 and hosted Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in October, when both sides signed a border defence cooperation agreement to formalise and expand confidence building measures.\n\nWhile neither India nor Japan found mention in Mr. Li's remarks, the Premier instead highlighted China's warming ties with Vietnam \u2014 one among many claimants in the South China Sea dispute \u2014 as reflected in a joint maritime cooperation agreement signed during his visit to the country last year.\n\nAt his annual interaction with domestic and foreign journalists \u2014 a carefully choreographed affair where the questions are pre-screened by the Chinese Foreign Ministry \u2014 the Premier fielded several questions on economic issues, as well as on ties with the U.S., Europe, Taiwan and Hong Kong.\n\nHe also pledged to ramp up the battle against official graft, saying the government would show \u201czero tolerance\u201d to the corrupt. \u201cNo matter how senior an official is, if he violates party discipline and the law of the country he will be seriously dealt with and punished,\u201d he said.\n\nRising pollution\n\nOn the environment, he said the government would take steps to tackle rising pollution, with increasing public anger at the worsening smog enveloping many of China's cities.\n\nHe acknowledged that air pollution had become a \u201cmajor issue for people's lives\u201d. \u201cFor many people, the first thing to do [in the morning] is to check the PM 2.5 figure,\u201d he said, referring to particulate matter pollution readings.\n\nIn a government work report issued last week outlining policies for the coming year, Mr. Li promised to \u201cdeclare war on smog\u201d. He said Thursday this did not mean \u201ca war against nature\u201d, but a \u201cwar against our own efficient and unsustainable model of growth and way of life\u201d.\n\nGDP growth\n\nHe reiterated confidence in the Chinese economy and indicated it would achieve the target of \u201cabout 7.5 per cent\u201d growth, but added the government was \u201cnot preoccupied with GDP growth\u201d. \u201cThe growth that we want,\u201d he said, \u201cis one that brings real benefits to the people, raises quality and efficiency of development, and contributes to energy conservation and environmental protection\u201d","100":"CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

Beijing has launched an all-out search and rescue mission, with eight vessels scouring waters around MH370's last confirmed location and 10 satellites providing technological support in the space.\n\nThe China Maritime Search and Rescue Center said Thursday that Chinese search teams searched 23,282 square km of waters as of 6 p.m. (1000 GMT) Wednesday and will cover 19,768 square km on Thursday.\n\nThe latest clue emerged Wednesday evening when China's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence (SASTIND) said a Chinese satellite has found three floating objects at a suspected site.\n\nThe images, which were captured around 11 a.m. Sunday, show that the objects measure 13 by 18 meters, 14 by 19 meters and 24 by 22 meters, respectively, said SASTIND, adding that the discovery is being analyzed.\n\nAccording to the agency, the objects were spotted in the South China Sea at 6.7 degrees north latitude and 105.63 degrees east longitude and spread across an area with a radius of 20 km.\n\nIt remains unclear whether the suspicious items originate from the missing plane. Previously detected pieces of debris have all turned out to be false alarms.\n\nIn yet another twist of the mystery around MH370, Malaysian Air Force chief Rodzali Daud told reporters in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday that an unidentified object was plotted on military radar at 2:15 a.m. Saturday over the northern Malacca Strait.\n\nThe last definitive sighting on civilian radar was recorded around 1:30 am on Saturday, less than an hour after the plane took off from Kuala Lumpur, as it flew northeast over Vietnamese waters.\n\n\"I am not saying it's flight MH370.

It was an unidentifiable plot,\" Daud said.\n\nThe air force chief denied reports that military radar tracked MH370 flying over the Strait of Malacca, but he did not rule out the possibility that the aircraft might have turned back before disappearing.\n\nIn order to help unravel the mystery and find the plane as soon as possible, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) has proposed sending an expert team to Malaysia.\n\nMalaysia's special envoy, Ong Ka Ting, said the Malaysian government will give priority to China's proposal and open a communication channel between the aviation authorities of the two sides swiftly.\n\nMore than 80 ships and planes from around a dozen contributors are now combing the waters on both sides of the Malaysian peninsula to locate the missing plane.\n\nThe most urgent task now is to speed up the search and rescue operations, said Guo Shaochun, head of a Chinese task force, at a press conference held in the Chinese embassy in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nHe also urged the Malaysian side \"to listen carefully to the next of kin of the Chinese passengers and take swift actions to respond to the needs of the families.\"\n\nMalaysia Airlines said it has deployed a total of 112 care-givers to provide the family members of MH370 passengers and crew \"with emotional support and ensure their basis needs are met to try and make this difficult time relatively bearable.\"\n\nIn its latest statement, the carrier said the MH370 and MH371 flight codes will be retired from its Kuala Lumpur-Beijing route \"as a mark of respect\" to the passengers and crew of the missing plane.\n\n\n\nRead more in Special Coverage:\n\n\n\n","103":"BEIJING Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said on Thursday that there was \"friction\" with the United States, and the world's two biggest economies must respect each other's core interests.\n\nWashington and Beijing have grappled over a range of issues, including human rights, cyber hacking, trade disputes and China's growing military assertiveness over seas contested with its neighbors.\n\n\"It's a fact that some friction exists in the course of cooperation, but this is the trouble with cooperation,\" Li told a news conference at the close of China's annual parliamentary session on Thursday.\n\n\"Of course, China and the United States, because their history and cultural background are different, and their stage of development is different, there are differences on some issues.\"\n\nLi did not mention specific issues in U.S.-China relations, steering clear of sensitive domestic and international issues facing China's ruling Communist Party.\n\nThe United States is uneasy about what it sees as China's effort to gain creeping control over waters in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nChina is in the midst of a sovereignty dispute with U.S.-ally Japan over a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea.\n\nChina also has conflicting territorial claims with the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei across a waterway in the South China Sea that provides 10 percent of the global fisheries catch and carries $5 trillion in ship-borne trade.\n\nFor its part, Beijing has expressed concern over the U.S. military \"pivot\" towards Asia.\n\nDespite the tensions, both sides have an overriding interest in maintaining the health of the world economy.\n\n\"As long as we respect each other, respect each other's core interests and major concerns, control well our differences, have equal consultations, and especially pay particular attention to expanding our common interests, then (we will) be able to enhance the level of our bilateral relations,\" Li said.\n\n(Reporting By Sui-Lee Wee, Ben Blanchard and Megha Rajagopalan, Writing by Michael Martina;

From high-tech products to cutting-edge scientific research and development, China's drive to shift its role from \"the factory floor of the world\" to an inventor and innovator has become a hot topic at home and abroad. Xinhua reporters carried out a series of interviews around the world to sketch out how the foreigners think of the the China-developed products and the related developments. DIALOGUE 1 Xinhua: Do you have anything developed and produced in China? How do you feel about them? \"I don't know it was made by China,\" said a Californian commuter Passti, referring to the BYD E-bus she is on. \"It's very comfortable, very clean and quiet, I love it ... It would be perfect if it has more space.\" The bus driver Derrick Smith also expressed his fondness for the bus. \"I actually like driving BYD's electric buses over any gas-fueled or CNG-fueled buses. They ride a lot smoother, cleaner; they feel a lot lighter, and the driver area is more comfortable,\" he said. Beside electronic busses, China-designed cellphones have also edged into the Western society. \"Of course I use the ZTE phones. I am proud to use it,\" said Nicklas Sivander, sales director of ZTE's Sweden office. \"It has all the features I need ... I also control my whole home music system with this smartphone. So it's my everyday tool.\" DIALOGUE 2 Xinhua: What are the competitive edges and weaknesses of Chinese manufactured products compared with their international competitors? \"The (Chinese) technology is very good,\" said Brenden Riley, sales chief of BYD's North American office. \"My only concern with Chinese new tech is that I don't find the design so pretty yet, but that will come with time.\" Chinese-made products \"need to be cooler, prettier,\" Riley noted. \"The life cycle of high-tech products is short, so the international competition requires a different way, more localized ... I think it's coming but just not there yet.\" However, to Sivander, the tempting quality and price of Chinese mobiles made them successful in local market. \"We have all the features that any advanced smartphone has on the market right now,\" he said, \"The good thing with this phone is we can offer it with attractive price here in north Europe, which means that we are competing with the major player but giving more value for money.\" \"What we need to improve our performance here is to work on our brand, to inform the consumers that ZTE exists and has designed proper products,\" Sivander suggested. DIALOGUE 3 Xinhua: How is Chinese scientific groups' papers publication doing, in terms of originality, forwardness and growing rate? According to data provided by Natasha D. Pinol, senior communications officer of science, almost 70 published original research papers have listed authors from China in 2010. But to 2013, the number has rocketed to 104. Dr. Nick Campbell, executive editor of Nature, also said increasing research papers from China have been published in his journals in recent years. \"From 2008 to 2012 we saw the contribution from Chinese authors to papers in Nature rapidly increase to 2.5 percent in 2012 compared to 1.5 percent in 2008,\" he said. \"Over the same period China' share of papers in all Nature journals were more than doubled, from 1.5 percent to 4.2 percent.\" The editor told Xinhua that the Chinese Academy of Sciences has replaced the University of Tokyo in January 2013 as the largest institutional contributor to Nature in the Asia-Pacific. \"All indications at this stage are that this pattern of growth has continued,\" said Campbell. \"Our criteria for selection focus on original findings of outstanding significance that are of interest to an interdisciplinary readership... in broad terms, an improvement in the number of Chinese researchers that are meeting these exacting standards in their papers.\" DIALOGUE 4 Xinhua: China has made considerate investment in scientific R&D. Can you tell us how is China's research output compared with that of the West? What should be underlined in China's reform of its scientific and research system in your opinion? \"Government support for science clearly helps to speed scientific advancement,\" said Pinol. \"Adequate federal support for research and development is essential to innovation. China's leaders clearly recognize the connection between increased government support for science and the discoveries that drive economic prosperity.\" As for Campbell, he said research-output efficiency is not a trivial thing to measure. \"We would never suggest that you should use publications in Nature journals,\" he said. \"Nonetheless we can at least look at how countries do relative to their total number of researchers. These figures show that China's contribution to these journals is lower than smaller Asia-Pacific countries such as Australia and Singapore, and the largest global contributors to Nature journals, the USA and UK.\" However, the executive editor argued that there is no perfect way of organizing a research funding system. \"Many nations are struggling to strike an appropriate balance bet,\" he said. \"Like all nations, China needs to continue to focus on improvements that reward high quality research outcomes and help leverage that research to ultimately make a substantive positive impact on broader society.\"","115":"NEW YORK (MarketWatch) \u2014 U.S. stock futures got a boost on Thursday from a duo of reports, which showed a surprise drop in weekly jobless claims and a rise in retail sales in February.\n\nShares of Plug Power Inc. and Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc. both jumped in premarket on earnings reports.\n\nValue Portfolio: Tech, energy, & industrial stocks (4:05) Barron's Top Financial Advisor John Barrett tells Jack Otter where he's putting his clients' money now, and why it's too early to get back into emerging markets.\n\nFutures for the S&P 500 index US:SPH4 rose 4.2 points to 1,871.90, while those for the Dow Jones Industrial Average US:DJH4 added 31 points to 16,370.

The share price will be cut in half from Wednesday's lofty per-share level of $1,207.30 , but investors will see their ability to have a say in the company greatly reduced.\n\nThe changes kick off on April 2, when Google will, using newly created class C stock, pay a dividend to existing holders of the company's class A and class B shares. The new class C shares will carry no voting rights, making them unusual relative to the common shares issued by most companies.\n\nS&P Dow Jones Indices has reversed course on the way it will deal with the situation in the S&P 500. Originally, the index provider was going to replace Google's class A shares in the index with class C.

Those criteria include tests of liquidity and materiality levels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nS&P Dow Jones Indices is reviewing the companies in the S&P 500 that already have several classes of stock that trade and will decide which ones will be added to the index by September 2015.\n\nCurrently, there are nearly 50 companies in the S&P 500 that have multiple classes of stock that trade, including Berkshire Hathaway, Brown-Forman and CBS. More companies are considering multiple classes of stock to give management tools to fend off shareholder activists, maintain control and prioritise who gets dividends, says Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones indices.\n\nGoogle currently has two classes of stock. The class A shares, which are held by the public, carry one vote per share. The class B shares, controlled by the company's founders, receive 10 votes.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\n\nNEW YORK World stock indexes declined for a fourth day and copper dipped to near four-year lows before rebounding on Wednesday as worries about China's economic slowdown intensified.\n\nThe concerns over China also pressured the Chilean peso and other currencies closely linked to commodities markets, while increasing investor appetite for safe-haven assets boosted U.S. government bonds and gold.\n\nThe moves follow China's first domestic bond default, which has raised concerns about a possible unraveling of the many loan deals which have used copper as collateral.\n\nChinese firms that have difficulty raising loans have often bought copper as security for funds they borrow, but the 14 percent drop in copper's value this year is making banks more wary about the practice.\n\nData, including China's recent weak export numbers, has underscored worries that the world's second-largest economy is slowing. This has added to strains on emerging markets already hit by the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to scale back its economic stimulus.\n\n\"People are reluctant to make big bets right now,\" said Marc Chandler, chief global currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co in New York. \"People are just reducing their short position in emerging market exposure.\"\n\nCopper on the London Metal Exchange slid to a session low of $6,376.25 a tonne, its weakest level since July 2010, before recovering to end at $6,505, up 0.5 percent from Tuesday's close. Three-month LME copper has shed more than 11 percent this year, including a 2.6 percent drop on Tuesday.\n\n\"Most people are still cautious so we can't expect a quick rebound,\" said Andrey Kryuchenkov, analyst at VTB Capital. \"On a fundamental point of view we have to wait and see in the second quarter how China stimulates its economy.\"\n\nOn Wall Street, the S&P 500 reversed early losses and ended nearly flat amid signs of progress in diplomatic attempts to ease tensions in Ukraine.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 11.17 points or 0.07 percent, to 16,340.08, the S&P 500 gained 0.57 points or 0.03 percent, to 1,868.2 and the Nasdaq Composite added 16.144 points or 0.37 percent, to 4,323.332.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, in London on Friday ahead of a referendum Sunday on whether Ukraine's Crimean peninsula will join Russia.\n\n\"People are just kind of reassessing, they are looking at that headline and thinking maybe it is not going to turn out to be a disaster in Russia and Ukraine,\" said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O'Neil Securities in New York.\n\nShares of Fannie Mae FNMA.OB and Freddie Mac FMCC.OB fell sharply, a day after leaders of the Senate Banking Committee announced an agreement on legislation to wind down the government-owned mortgage financiers. Fannie Mae dropped 12.2 percent to $3.54, while shares of Freddie Mac tumbled 16.8 percent at $3.36.\n\nThe difference in yield on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds over Treasuries declined on the view the Senate plan would assure the government's guarantee of their existing debt. The yield gap between five-year Fannie Mae notes due February 2019 over five-year Treasuries narrowed 0.005 percentage point to about 0.15 percentage point.\n\nIn Europe, shares .FTEU3 closed down 1.1 percent, with shares in big exporters among the hardest hit.

The International Air Transport Association expects the profit this year to be $18.7 billion, down from the $19.7 billion it forecast in December, due mainly to the impact of rising jet fuel prices.

The dollar fell against the yen and was nearly unchanged against the euro.\n\nGENEVA (AP) \u2014 The global airlines industry has lowered its profit forecast for 2014 due to rising jet fuel prices, but says Venezuela\u2019s financial policy, Ukraine\u2019s political upheaval and a vanished Malaysian jetliner add to the uncertainty. Tony Tyler, director-general and CEO of the International Air Transport Association, says the profit this year is expected to be $18.7 billion, a downgrade from the $19.7 billion it forecast in December.

The search giant has been expected to split their stock for quite some time, though nothing has come of it until now. In addition to the split, they will have three categories of stock for purchase. The lower-end pricing after the split is still expected to be well out of the reach of most of us, though.\n\nThe stock will now be split into three categories, with the third being the new listing. Here\u2019s how it will shake out:\n\nClass A stock: This is already traded on the market.\n\nClass B stock: Employee stock, which has ten times the voting power of Class A stock.\n\nClass C stock: New. Offered publicly, Class C has no voting power.\n\nIn splitting the stock, Google is effectively listing themselves twice on the stock exchange (Class A and C), which had some concerned the S&P 500 would drop one of them. In a surprise move, the S&P notes they\u2019ll offer both Google stocks, which is a change to their policy of only having a company\u2019s stock listed once on their index. Though there will still be 500 companies on the index, the S&P is choosing to list additional stock, potentially opening themselves up to other stock splits to those on their index.\n\nEven with a split, the stock should still be right around $600 for both A and C. The split is designed to keep Larry and Sergey in control, which was the idea behind a different split years ago. By offering ten times the voting power, and holding a big portion of stock, the two can effectively run Google as they like.

Here, certainly China is a big part of it and the Ukraine situation is really not cleared in any way.\"\n\nUkraine's government appealed for Western help on Tuesday to stop Moscow annexing Crimea, but the Black Sea peninsula, overrun by Russian troops, seemed fixed on a course that could formalize rule from Moscow within days.\n\nEU member states have agreed the wording of sanctions on Russia, including travel restrictions and asset freezes against those responsible for violating the sovereignty of Ukraine, according to a draft document seen by Reuters.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 38.75 points or 0.24 percent, to 16,312.5, the S&P 500 lost 5.64 points or 0.3 percent, to 1,861.99 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 10.967 points or 0.25 percent, to 4,296.221.\n\nEPL Oil & Gas Inc jumped 29.8 percent to $37.78 after the company agreed to be acquired by larger rival Energy XXI Ltd for $2.3 billion, including debt. Energy XXI shares lost 5.7 percent to $22.03.\n\nExpress Inc dropped 9.4 percent to $16.52 after the apparel retailer reported fourth-quarter earnings and forecast a profit for the current quarter that fell far short of analyst expectations.\n\nOxigene Inc surged 94.2 percent to $4.67. The company said its experimental drug Zybrestat, combined with Roche's cancer drug Avastin, significantly slowed progression of recurrent ovarian cancer better than Avastin alone in a midstage clinical trial.\n\nGeron Corp plunged 65 percent to $1.54. The company said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ordered a halt to trials of its cancer drug imetelstat over concerns about potential liver damage."},"Doc_sentiment":{"0":{"score":-2.59,"sentiment":"Ne"},"1":{"score":3.19,"sentiment":"P"},"2":{"score":-2.96,"sentiment":"Ne"},"3":{"score":-2.96,"sentiment":"Ne"},"4":{"score":2.76,"sentiment":"P"},"5":{"score":8.7,"sentiment":"VP"},"6":{"score":0.0,"sentiment":"N"},"7":{"score":0.7,"sentiment":"N"},"8":{"score":1.32,"sentiment":"P"},"9":{"score":2.14,"sentiment":"P"},"10":{"score":0.39,"sentiment":"N"},"11":{"score":-1.03,"sentiment":"Ne"},"12":{"score":3.85,"sentiment":"P"},"13":{"score":0.55,"sentiment":"N"},"14":{"score":8.7,"sentiment":"VP"},"15":{"score":-2.4,"sentiment":"Ne"},"16":{"score":-1.13,"sentiment":"Ne"},"17":{"score":0.54,"sentiment":"N"},"18":{"score":-2.23,"sentiment":"Ne"},"19":{"score":0.79,"sentiment":"N"},"20":{"score":1.08,"sentiment":"P"},"21":{"score":-0.43,"sentiment":"N"},"22":{"score":-1.13,"sentiment":"Ne"},"23":{"score":1.84,"sentiment":"P"},"24":{"score":-2.62,"sentiment":"Ne"},"25":{"score":0.39,"sentiment":"N"},"26":{"score":-1.71,"sentiment":"Ne"},"27":{"score":-1.36,"sentiment":"Ne"},"28":{"score":-0.55,"sentiment":"N"},"29":{"score":0.6,"sentiment":"N"},"30":{"score":-1.76,"sentiment":"Ne"},"31":{"score":-0.07,"sentiment":"N"},"32":{"score":0.0,"sentiment":"N"},"33":{"score":-4.35,"sentiment":"Ne"},"34":{"score":3.09,"sentiment":"P"},"35":{"score":-4.7,"sentiment":"Ne"},"36":{"score":1.08,"sentiment":"P"},"37":{"score":0.75,"sentiment":"N"},"38":{"score":-0.07,"sentiment":"N"},"39":{"score":3.85,"sentiment":"P"},"40":{"score":0.2,"sentiment":"N"},"41":{"score":-4.38,"sentiment":"Ne"},"42":{"score":1.13,"sentiment":"P"},"43":{"score":0.38,"sentiment":"N"},"44":{"score":-1.5,"sentiment":"Ne"},"45":{"score":0.14,"sentiment":"N"},"46":{"score":2.96,"sentiment":"P"},"47":{"score":2.33,"sentiment":"P"},"48":{"score":3.15,"sentiment":"P"},"49":{"score":0.35,"sentiment":"N"},"50":{"score":-0.11,"sentiment":"N"},"51":{"score":3.28,"sentiment":"P"},"52":{"score":0.78,"sentiment":"N"},"53":{"score":-0.38,"sentiment":"N"},"54":{"score":3.89,"sentiment":"P"},"55":{"score":5.53,"sentiment":"VP"},"56":{"score":1.04,"sentiment":"P"},"57":{"score":-1.19,"sentiment":"Ne"},"58":{"score":1.23,"sentiment":"P"},"59":{"score":4.49,"sentiment":"P"},"60":{"score":-0.26,"sentiment":"N"},"61":{"score":-3.09,"sentiment":"Ne"},"62":{"score":-1.76,"sentiment":"Ne"},"63":{"score":7.7,"sentiment":"VP"},"64":{"score":7.7,"sentiment":"VP"},"65":{"score":3.42,"sentiment":"P"},"66":{"score":0.71,"sentiment":"N"},"67":{"score":-8.4,"sentiment":"VNe"},"68":{"score":1.25,"sentiment":"P"},"69":{"score":0.62,"sentiment":"N"},"70":{"score":5.71,"sentiment":"VP"},"71":{"score":3.85,"sentiment":"P"},"72":{"score":3.85,"sentiment":"P"},"73":{"score":-1.5,"sentiment":"Ne"},"74":{"score":-0.61,"sentiment":"N"},"75":{"score":0.34,"sentiment":"N"},"76":{"score":1.35,"sentiment":"P"},"77":{"score":0.11,"sentiment":"N"},"78":{"score":0.6,"sentiment":"N"},"79":{"score":-0.6,"sentiment":"N"},"80":{"score":0.0,"sentiment":"N"},"81":{"score":3.14,"sentiment":"P"},"82":{"score":1.56,"sentiment":"P"},"83":{"score":3.63,"sentiment":"P"},"84":{"score":1.5,"sentiment":"P"},"85":{"score":0.83,"sentiment":"N"},"86":{"score":-0.26,"sentiment":"N"},"87":{"score":1.42,"sentiment":"P"},"88":{"score":0.82,"sentiment":"N"},"89":{"score":0.11,"sentiment":"N"},"90":{"score":3.86,"sentiment":"P"},"91":{"score":-1.0,"sentiment":"Ne"},"92":{"score":-3.2,"sentiment":"Ne"},"93":{"score":3.93,"sentiment":"P"},"94":{"score":0.51,"sentiment":"N"},"95":{"score":0.84,"sentiment":"N"},"96":{"score":5.75,"sentiment":"VP"},"97":{"score":2.36,"sentiment":"P"},"98":{"score":3.65,"sentiment":"P"},"99":{"score":0.93,"sentiment":"N"},"100":{"score":-3.2,"sentiment":"Ne"},"101":{"score":1.85,"sentiment":"P"},"102":{"score":0.83,"sentiment":"N"},"103":{"score":0.58,"sentiment":"N"},"104":{"score":2.63,"sentiment":"P"},"105":{"score":3.37,"sentiment":"P"},"106":{"score":-6.6,"sentiment":"VNe"},"107":{"score":1.2,"sentiment":"P"},"108":{"score":6.23,"sentiment":"VP"},"109":{"score":7.7,"sentiment":"VP"},"110":{"score":4.35,"sentiment":"P"},"111":{"score":2.39,"sentiment":"P"},"112":{"score":3.01,"sentiment":"P"},"113":{"score":8.4,"sentiment":"VP"},"114":{"score":0.34,"sentiment":"N"},"115":{"score":-0.03,"sentiment":"N"},"116":{"score":-6.75,"sentiment":"VNe"},"117":{"score":-1.5,"sentiment":"Ne"},"118":{"score":-0.5,"sentiment":"N"},"119":{"score":-0.11,"sentiment":"N"},"120":{"score":-0.32,"sentiment":"N"},"121":{"score":-4.35,"sentiment":"Ne"},"122":{"score":-0.17,"sentiment":"N"},"123":{"score":-1.5,"sentiment":"Ne"},"124":{"score":0.0,"sentiment":"N"},"125":{"score":0.55,"sentiment":"N"},"126":{"score":0.0,"sentiment":"N"},"127":{"score":-1.2,"sentiment":"Ne"},"128":{"score":3.61,"sentiment":"P"},"129":{"score":0.0,"sentiment":"N"},"130":{"score":0.0,"sentiment":"N"},"131":{"score":0.53,"sentiment":"N"},"132":{"score":-0.3,"sentiment":"N"},"133":{"score":-0.55,"sentiment":"N"},"134":{"score":0.25,"sentiment":"N"},"135":{"score":0.0,"sentiment":"
