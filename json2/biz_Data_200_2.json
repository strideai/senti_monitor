Eight Chinese companies listed in the US last year and only two in 2012, research company zero2ipo said in a report.\n\nDavid Ethridge, senior vice-president and head of capital markets at NYSE Euronext Inc, said earlier this year that 15 to 20 Chinese companies, most of them tech companies, are expected to list at the exchange.\n\nAlibaba said an IPO in the US would \"make us a more global company and enhance the company's transparency, as well as allow the company to continue to pursue our long-term vision and ideals\".\n\nShould circumstances permit, Alibaba will extend its public status in the domestic capital market to share its growth with the people of China, the statement said.\n\nThe decision to seek an IPO in New York has put an end to rumors about its choice of venue, after the Internet behemoth wrapped up major buyouts to stay agile against cutthroat competition in the mobile Internet age.\n\nThe company had yet to decide a timetable, the underwriter, or the amount of money it hopes to raise through a listing, Alibaba spokesman Yang Lei said.\n\nAlibaba failed to persuade Hong Kong regulators to accept its governance structure as it sought a listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.\n\nAlibaba's special request to keep a unique shareholder structure, allowing a group of top managers and founders to nominate and control the company's board, violated the exchange's principle of \"one share, one vote\".\n\nAlibaba's founding members own about 13 percent of the company, while Japan's Softbank controls 37 percent and Yahoo, from the US, 24 percent.\n\nThe proposed US listing is the most anticipated IPO since social networking site Facebook raised $16 billion in 2012. Analysts polled by Reuters have put Alibaba's market value at around $140 billion and the value of the IPO at $15 billion.\n\nThe move came just two days after micro-blogging company Sina Weibo filed to raise $500 million via a US IPO. Alibaba holds 18 percent of Sina Weibo's shares.\n\nAblibaba's announcement of an IPO plan suggested it has fulfilled specific requirements of either the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, Li from Analysys International said.\n\n\"The dual-class stock structures, allowed by some US exchanges, can enable insiders to hold the controlling power even after a company becomes public. Companies of such structure issued shares to founders and prioritized investors that have multiple votes,\" she said.\n\nBut adjustments should still be made accordingly if Alibaba wishes to float its shares, Hong said.\n\n\"In a typical dual-class structure, the voting weight is subject to changes of its share-holding percentage. However in Alibaba's case, the 28-person partnership will have the absolute right to nominate a majority of the directors, even if their shares are diluted in the future,\" he said.\n\nHangzhou-based Alibaba has facilitated online transactions for multinational chain stores and mom-and-pop vendors. Gross merchandise traded on Alibaba reached $240 billion in 2013, while the figure for its equivalent Amazon was $100 billion, according to Forrester Research.\n\nIts payment spinoff, Alipay, offers online saving funds with higher returns and online-to-offline payment solutions.\n\nBut such dominance is being eroded by rival Tencent, which rolled out mobile payment services via chat app WeChat and encroached on many services that overlap with Alibaba's portfolio. Analysts regarded the listing as timely since the current valuation may reach its peak level.\n\n\"The going-mobile war has just started and it's too early to tell who has a better chance to edge out, leaving investors the opportunity to put a bet on Alibaba,\" Li said.\n\nBut Li Yi, secretary-general of the China Mobile Internet Industry Association, said Alibaba's prospects are not so rosy, as it is short of effective mobile access points.\n\n\"It's easy to move from social networking to e-commerce. But the reverse goal, which Alibaba is struggling to do, is hard to achieve,\" he said.","4":"Stock exchange chief Charles Li Xiaojia says the city must be ready to reform its share-listing rules if it wants to stay a globally competitive financial centre, but it was right to stick to principles that saw it lose out yesterday to New York for the potential HK$100 billion listing of Alibaba.\n\nLi spoke to the South China Morning Post hours after mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba said it had picked New York after months of wrangling with Hong Kong regulators over its management structure that the Securities and Futures Commission said breached its \"one shareholder, one vote\" governance rules.\n\n\"Everything has a cost. Our persistence has a cost too,\" Li told the Post, but added that Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing would continue with the review of its existing listing rules - which began after a stalemate with Alibaba last autumn - even though the deal was now dead.\n\nWe would not bend our existing rules just for one applicant\n\nCharles Li Xiaojia\n\n\"The reform review in the HKEx will not stop because Alibaba has decided to list elsewhere,\" Li said. \"We would not bend our existing rules just for one applicant, but Alibaba's proposal has propelled the management to review our operating model. The eventual loss may be even larger if we don't undergo reforms [of the] listing regime.\"\n\nHowever, the stock exchange chief was careful to back regulation that many international investors - and the SFC - say define Hong Kong as a respected market in which to trade and invest.\n\n\"We feel proud of Hong Kong as we ensure that our rule of law and investor protection remain intact,\" Li said.\n\nHangzhou -based Alibaba, led by former English teacher Jack Ma Yun, said yesterday that it would begin the process for an initial public offering in New York.\n\nHong Kong's regulators had rejected Alibaba's wish for an amendment to the city's listing rules to accommodate a partnership structure that gives Ma and other senior managers the right to nominate a majority of board members, despite owning only around 10 per cent of the firm's stock. Exchanges in the US allow such dual-class structures. The other major stock holders in Alibaba are Yahoo and Softbank.\n\nAlibaba is expected to raise US$15 billion in New York in the highest-profile listing since Facebook's US$16 billion IPO in 2012.\n\nThe estimate is based on the firm's current expected market value of between US$100 billion and US$120 billion.\n\nAlibaba said on its corporate blog yesterday that the steps towards a US IPO would make the firm \"more global and enhance the company's transparency, as well as allow the company to continue to pursue our long-term vision and ideals\".\n\nInvestment banks, including Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley, are said by market participants to be the lead managers for the Alibaba listing.\n\nThe US listing will provide a swift means for Alibaba to lower the cost of capital since the deal-hungry internet firm has spent more than US$3 billion in a buying spree over the past year.","5":"Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, one of the world\u2019s biggest Internet companies, said Sunday that it will go public on a U.S. stock exchange, a move analysts predict could raise up to $15 billion.\n\n\n\nThe announcement confirming plans for an IPO in the United States ended months of speculation over where the company would list its shares after talks for a Hong Kong stock sale fell apart last year.\n\nAlibaba, based in Hangzhou, China, has said that more than $150 billion worth of merchandise changes hands on its online platforms each year, more than Amazon and eBay combined.\n\nThe company was founded in 1999 by former English teacher Jack Ma, whose 17 employees worked out of his apartment to link Chinese suppliers with retailers abroad. It grew into an online retail behemoth, with offices around the world and more than 20,000 employees, controlling around 80 percent of China\u2019s e-commerce.\n\nAlibaba doesn't report its finances. But Yahoo, which owns a 24 percent stake in the company, said Alibaba's revenue for the quarter ending in September rose 51 percent from a year earlier to reach $1.8 billion.\n\nAnalysts estimate Alibaba has a value of at least $140 billion, and the IPO proceeds could exceed $15 billion. Facebook's IPO in June 2012 raised $16 billion and at the time valued the company at more than $100 billion.\n\nWhile the company didn\u2019t offer any details about the timing or size of the IPO or on which exchange it would list its shares, sources told Reuters that Alibaba is planning the public offering in the third quarter of 2014.\n\n\n\nAlibaba's decision to go to the U.S. is a blow to the Hong Kong stock exchange, which was initially the company's preferred venue for the IPO. The semiautonomous Chinese financial center's stock exchange refused to change its rules to accommodate the company's unusual management structure, in which it allows top executives owning 10 percent of the company to retain control of the board.\n\nHowever, Alibaba hinted that the door has not completely shut on listing its stock in Hong Kong.\n\n\"Should circumstances permit in the future, we will be constructive toward extending our public status in the China capital market in order to share our growth with the people of China,\" the company said in a release.\n\nThe listing will be closely watched by Alibaba's two largest shareholders \u2014 Yahoo and Japan's Softbank Corporation, which controls 37 percent of the company. Yahoo initially invested in Alibaba in 2005, but has said it plans to trim its stake in the company through the IPO.\n\nAlibaba is one of a number of Chinese Internet heavyweights planning to cash in with IPOs amid rapid growth. The announcement comes two days after Chinese Internet company Sina filed plans for a potential U.S. IPO for Weibo, its microblog unit. Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, indicated it plans to raise $500 million. Another Chinese online retailing giant, JD.com, filed in January for a U.S. stock listing.\n\nWire services","6":"Over the weekend, Alibaba Group confirmed recent speculation it would file for a U.S. IPO, although the company didn't file paperwork or provide details including which exchange it would trade on.On its website, Alibaba Group said:Alibaba could offer as much as $20 billion in the IPO, making it the largest in history according to PrivCo. Also with an expected valuation of at least $150 billion, this would also be the largest in history.The news is seen as a boon for Yahoo!

This will make us a more global company and enhance the companys transparency, as well as allow the company to continue to pursue our long-term vision and ideals.\"\n\nIt added that, \"Should circumstances permit in the future, we will be constructive toward extending our public status in the China capital market in order to share our growth with the people of China.\"\n\nSources cited by the Wall Street Journal estimated that the IPO could raise $\u00daS15 billion, but said it won't include the company's Alipay payment service or its money-market fund.\n\nYahoo remains a major shareholder in the Alibaba Group, a fact that is seen by many analysts as bolstering the US company's stock price at a time when its core business remains challenged.\n\nIn 2012, Yahoo reduced its stake from 40 per cent to 20 per cent, and the two companies amended their agreement so that Alibaba Group has the right to repurchase half of Yahoos remaining stake \"upon a qualifying initial public offering in the future,\" according to a statement issued at the time.","8":"We Use Cookies\n\nThis website uses cookies to store information on your computer.\n\nBy using this website you accept the use of cookies as explained in the terms of our cookie policy.","9":"Alibaba founder Jack Ma.

Alibaba revealed last month that it was launching an online shopping site in the US through its subsidiaries Vendio and Auctiva.

Such a structure, giving the founding partners control of the board, would violate Hong Kong\u2019s existing \u201cone shareholder, one vote\u201d rules.\n\nWhile Charles Li, chief executive of the Hong Kong Exchange, defended the decision not to compromise over Alibaba\u2019s demands, he warned that unless rules are changed the territory will continue to lose out in the race to list companies that are proposing alternative shareholder structures.\n\n\u201cInsisting on your principle is never without cost,\u201d Mr. Li said in an interview. \u201cBut we have to continue to innovate and dare to have the courage to reform, have the courage to do what is right, and to the extent we need to make the changes to anything we will do it,\u201d he said.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s exchange continues to capture the majority of listings by mainland Chinese companies and touts a busy pipeline of planned IPOs. But a focus on its commodities and derivatives business has drawn scrutiny after the exchange has missed out on a wave of Chinese tech companies that have instead listed in the U.S. Nine of the 10 biggest IPOs by Chinese Internet-related companies since 2009 have been in the U.S., according to data provider Dealogic.\n\nMr. Li said the exchange will need to do more to attract \u201cnew economy\u201d or tech companies, including how to accommodate structures that differ from those traditionally offered in the city.\n\n\u201cThese companies have not historically been treating Hong Kong as one of their top destinations, that is a fact,\u201d Mr. Li said.\n\nA planned review of the exchange\u2019s listing rules would need to consider change to rules such as those around a company\u2019s profit history and on the compliance requirements that have discouraged companies from picking Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cWhether those changes are something that needs to be taken into account is something we need to look at,\u201d he said.\n\nHong Kong was the world\u2019s No. 2 IPO market in 2013 behind the New York Stock Exchange, according to Dealogic, bouncing back after slipping to fourth place in 2012 following three years as No. 1. It has made a strong start to 2014 by attracting a number of high-profile new-share offerings.\n\nPeople familiar with the matter say that Alibaba\u2019s planned U.S. listing could raise as much as $15 billion in what would be the biggest U.S. IPO ever of a Chinese company. A $15 billion listing would top the dual New York-Hong Kong $5.7 billion listing of China Unicom Ltd. in 2000, according to Dealogic. Chinese Internet search company Baidu Inc. raised just $124 million in a 2005 IPO, though it now has a stock-market value of $56 billion.\n\nAnalysts said that the loss of Alibaba likely won\u2019t affect Hong Kong\u2019s exchange\u2019s revenue much but the bourse will need to send signals that it is open to considering similar proposals in the future.\n\n\u201cClearly if this prevents other listings of its kind, then that could be a problem in future,\u201d said Marcus Liu, an analyst at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets.\n\nTalks on a Hong Kong listing for Alibaba fell apart last September after both sides failed to reach a compromise.

The company finally paid a portion of the disputed fees, Feuer said, but then subtracted the same amount from its franchise fee payment, resulting in another underpayment.\n\nThe lawsuit comes just a few weeks after Time Warner Cable alerted its Southern California customers that it planned to hike rates by an average of about 6% a month for homes that are not covered by a promotional package.\n\nThe higher bills, which are expected to affect about 30% of its estimated 1.5 million customers in the region, kick in this month. The company said higher fees are needed to pay for rising programming costs and technical upgrades to the company\u2019s system.\n\nMeantime, Time Warner Cable has been playing hardball with DirecTV, Dish Network, Charter Communications, AT&T Inc.\u2019s U-Verse, Cox Communications and Verizon Communications Inc.\u2019s FiOS over terms to carry the new Los Angeles Dodgers channel.\n\nThe new channel launched on Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks systems late last month. However, most other pay TV distributors have been balking at the terms for providing the channel, contending that Time Warner Cable is demanding fees that are too high.\n\nUntil this season, Dodgers games were available in Los Angeles on local television station KCAL-TV Channel 9 and Fox\u2019s Prime Ticket regional sports cable network.\n\nBut for the first time in the team\u2019s history, none of the team\u2019s games will be available on free, over-the-air television. Fans must subscribe to a pay-TV service if they want to watch the Dodgers. So far, only Time Warner Cable and Bright House have the channel.\n\nTime Warner Cable agreed to an $8.35 billion, 25-year deal with the Dodgers\u2019 organization for the rights to distribute the channel, called SportsNet LA.\n\nThe carrier has been asking other distributors for more than $4 a month per subscriber, meaning the channel would cost their customers at least $50 a year \u2014 regardless of whether those viewers watched the Dodgers.\n\nLast summer, a contract dispute between Time Warner Cable and CBS Corp. resulted in a month-long blackout of KCBS-TV Channel 2 and KCAL-TV Channel 9 for customers of the cable company.\n\nThe city\u2019s lawsuit stems from its authority to charge cable companies franchise fees of 5% of a cable operators\u2019 gross revenues, in lieu of rent for the public right-of-way to install and maintain the company\u2019s wires and cable boxes.\n\nThe city also assesses fees to help pay for public, educational and governmental channels.

The city seeks nearly $10 million in fees, money it said could have helped ease its budget problems during the financial crisis.\n\n\"Time Warner owes L.A.'s taxpayers millions of dollars for the privilege of having its franchise,\" City Attorney Michael Feuer said during a City Hall news conference announcing the lawsuit. \"This is a day where we are standing up and saying enough is enough.\"\n\nON LOCATION: Where the cameras roll\n\nThe 24-page lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, contends that Time Warner Cable \"blatantly refused to live up to its obligations to the city\" to pay franchise fees to operate its cable network over city-owned rights of way while collecting more than $500 million a year from customers in the city.\n\nFeuer said the city has been negotiating with Time Warner Cable for several years.\n\n\"The negotiations haven't been fruitful and we have to do something about that,\" Feuer said. \"Time Warner pocketed the money from its subscribers and then did not turn it over to the city of Los Angeles.\"\n\nThe city contends that Time Warner Cable owes $9.7 million in fees, money that Feuer said could have been used to hire 100 police officers and make sidewalk repairs.\n\nTime Warner Cable, in a statement, denied the allegation that it had cheated the city.\n\n\"As a major job creator, tax contributor and service provider in the city of Los Angeles, Time Warner Cable is an active and responsible corporate citizen,\" the company said in a statement. \"We are disappointed the city has chosen to bring this action, which we strongly believe is without merit.\"\n\nThe lawsuit contends that Time Warner Cable owed $2.5 million in franchise fees and public, education and governmental channel fees in 2008 and 2009 and an additional $7.2 million in fees in 2010 and 2011.\n\nON LOCATION: Where the cameras roll\n\nThe city contends that once in 2008 and again in 2011, Time Warner Cable withheld more than $5 million in fees the city said it was owed. The company finally paid a portion of the disputed fees, Feuer said, but then subtracted the same amount from its franchise fee payment, resulting in another underpayment.\n\nThe lawsuit comes just a few weeks after Time Warner Cable alerted its Southern California customers that it planned to hike rates by an average of about 6% a month for homes that are not covered by a promotional package.\n\nThe higher bills, which are expected to affect about 30% of its estimated 1.5 million customers in the region, kick in this month. The company said higher fees are needed to pay for rising programming costs and technical upgrades to the company's system.\n\nMeantime, Time Warner Cable has been playing hardball with DirecTV, Dish Network, Charter Communications, AT&T Inc.'s U-Verse, Cox Communications and Verizon Communications Inc.'s FiOS over terms to carry the new Los Angeles Dodgers channel.\n\nThe new channel launched on Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks systems late last month. However, most other pay TV distributors have been balking at the terms for providing the channel, contending that Time Warner Cable is demanding fees that are too high.\n\nUntil this season, Dodgers games were available in Los Angeles on local television station KCAL-TV Channel 9 and Fox's Prime Ticket regional sports cable network.\n\nPHOTOS: Celebrities by The Times\n\nBut for the first time in the team's history, none of the team's games will be available on free, over-the-air television. Fans must subscribe to a pay-TV service if they want to watch the Dodgers. So far, only Time Warner Cable and Bright House have the channel.\n\nTime Warner Cable reportedly has agreed to an $8.35-billion, 25-year deal with the Dodgers' organization for the rights to distribute the channel, called SportsNet LA.\n\nThe carrier has been asking other distributors for more than $4 a month per subscriber, meaning the channel would cost their customers at least $50 a year \u2014 regardless of whether those viewers watched the Dodgers.\n\nLast summer, a contract dispute between Time Warner Cable and CBS Corp. resulted in a month-long blackout of KCBS-TV Channel 2 and KCAL-TV Channel 9 for customers of the cable company.\n\nThe city's lawsuit stems from its authority to charge cable companies franchise fees of 5% of a cable operators' gross revenues, in lieu of rent for the public right-of-way to install and maintain the company's wires and cable boxes.\n\nThe city also assesses fees to help pay for public, educational and governmental channels. Cable operators were required to pay fees to help support government and public access TV channels, including the construction and operation of TV studios. Cable subscribers receive those channels as part of their packages.\n\nmeg.james@latimes.com","55":"Time Warner Cable CEO Rob Marcus thinks the $45.2 billion megamerger with Comcast is a win for Time Warner Cable subscribers.\n\nSpeaking at the Deutsche Bank Media, Internet & Telecom Conference in Palm Beach, Fla., earlier this week, Marcus called the deal a \"dream combination\" that allows the companies to \"innovate at a rapid pace.\"\n\nI know what you're thinking: Of course he likes this deal. His company is getting bought out for $45.2 billion. And Marcus, who is paid in excess of $10 million a year, is the guy who spearheaded this tie-up in the first place. And there's little doubt he will profit handsomely from the acquisition.\n\nBut hear me out. He might actually be right.\n\nAs a Time Warner Cable customer for more than 15 years, I can attest that the service I've been getting for nearly two decades is nothing to write home about. And the bottom line is that the services that Comcast offers its customers today is simply better than what's available to Time Warner Cable consumers.\n\n\"Comcast is more innovative than any other operator when it comes to video service,\" said Erik Brannon, senior analyst for US Television at IHS. \"By contrast Time Warner Cable has been less interested in things like converting analog subscribers to digital subscribers. And the implication is that on the whole their network is not quite as robust as Comcast's.\"\n\nEven though Comcast hasn't made any promises about when or where Time Warner Cable customers will get Comcast's suite of services, it's clear these offerings will eventually make it to Time Warner Cable territory. And that could be a very good thing for Time Warner customers in spite of concerns that the cable giant is getting even larger.\n\n\"Some features and services people can expect relatively quickly after the merger,\" said Marcien Jenckes, executive vice president of consumer services for Comcast. \"Today we're the leaders in terms of broadband speeds, TV content catalog and experience, as well as TV Everywhere. And Time Warner Cable customers can expect all of this over time.\"\n\nIt's hard not to be skeptical\n\nI realize many consumers are skeptical of big mergers such as this one. And this particular merger is as big as they get. Comcast and Time Warner Cable are the No. 1 and No. 2 cable operators in the country. The combined company would control 33 million broadband connections. Together the companies will be in 19 of the 20 largest metro markets in the country. So it's easy to see why people are concerned and even skeptical of a deal that concentrates so much power in the hands of one company.\n\nComcast\n\nAdd on top of that, the fact that rates on expanded basic cable TV service have increased by more than 20 percent in recent years, it's hard to imagine that a merger of this proportion could be positive for consumers. Don't forget, Philadelphia-based Comcast and New York-based Time Warner Cable consistently rank at the bottom of most customer satisfaction surveys.\n\nWhat many consumer advocates and lawmakers such as Senator Al Franken (D-Minn.) surmise is that this must mean bad news for consumers.\n\n\"I think consumers will end up paying more,\" Franken said Monday on the \"CBS This Morning\" show, according to Variety. \"There will be less competition; there will be less innovation and, worse, even worse service.\"\n\nThese are indeed legitimate fears. It's difficult to imagine that a merger of this size would actually lead to better customer service and satisfaction. I also am not so bold as to predict that prices might actually go down for former Time Warner Cable customers. In fact, Comcast's own David Cohen has admitted he can't make that assurance either: \"We're certainly not promising that customer bills are going to go down or even increase less rapidly.\"\n\nStill, the reality is that when you really look at Comcast's network and services, and even its pricing, compared to Time Warner Cable's services, an argument can be made that Time Warner Cable customers may have a lot to gain from being converted to Comcast customers.\n\n\"For all the complaints about how expensive cable TV is, Comcast has traditionally offered its customers the best bang for the buck in the industry,\" said Craig Moffett, an equities analyst with MoffettNathanson.\n\nMore value for your money, especially in video\n\nWhen it comes to video service, there's no question that Comcast has a better offering compared with what Time Warner Cable offers today. From its video-on-demand catalog to its TV Everywhere service to a cloud-based user interface it's been developing the past couple of years, Comcast has invested heavily in revamping its TV service, and it shows.\n\n\"Comcast has really focused on investing in its network,\" IHS analyst Brannon said. \"Time Warner Cable has been reacting to changes in the market too, but not with the same speed or veracity that Comcast has. And they've suffered as a consequence.\"\n\nSpecifically, Time Warner Cable has been less interested and less willing to spend money to upgrade its network to digital transmission. The result has been that Time Warner Cable offers fewer high-definition on-demand streams and its TV Everywhere product, which allows people to view TV on mobile devices anywhere, has been limited in terms of available programming.\n\nMeanwhile, Comcast offers more video-on-demand content than any other paid TV provider in the country. This includes a library of movies and TV shows that totals more than 50,000 titles that are free or can be rented for a fee.\n\nAdditionally, Comcast is the leader in TV Everywhere. Through its Xfinity TV Go app, viewers can watch 35 live TV channels on their tablets or smartphones. This compares with a mere 12 TV Everywhere channels available from Time Warner. Comcast customers also get access to more than 25,000 on-demand shows and videos through the app.\n\nAnd Comcast is constantly in search of new content to add to its portfolio. It recently announced it has struck deals with Sony Pictures and Lions Gate to start offering \"House of Cards\" and \"Orange Is the New Black\" to its lineup of on-demand content. Up until these deals, these two TV series were exclusive to Netflix subscribers.\n\nBut Comcast hasn't stopped there. It also has revamped its user interface and program guide based on a new cloud architecture it calls X1. Not only are the program guide and user interface much more interactive, which allows for more personalization, but the X1 platform allows subscribers to access TV shows and movies in new ways.\n\nComcast\n\nFor example, Comcast subscribers can view all live TV and recorded DVR shows on their mobile devices while in the home via the X1 platform. And they can even download recorded content from their DVR on their mobile devices for viewing outside the home. Comcast is testing the service right now in Boston and hopes to have it rolled out to the rest of its territory later this year.\n\n\"When we ask people to pay $70 a month, we want to make sure we're delivering a value,\" Comcast's Jenckes said. \"In fact, our job is to deliver the best price value to our subscribers. And we are achieving that in ways that no one else in the industry can match.\"\n\nShooting itself in the foot\n\nA lack of technology investment isn't the only reason why Time Warner Cable's service trails behind Comcast's. The company also has a history of contentious negotiations with programmers over digital video rights. As a result, the company has not been able to add as many channels to its TV Everywhere service or as many titles to its VOD service as Comcast. But there have been other consequences as well. A dispute this past summer over retransmission fees with broadcaster CBS led to a weeks-long black-out of CBS programming for Time Warner Cable customers. (CBS is the parent company of CNET.) Some 300,000 Time Warner Cable TV subscribers left over the debacle.\n\n\"The general feeling in the industry is that Time Warner Cable has been more resistant in terms of fee increases for content,\" Brannon said. \"This reluctance has put them behind others in terms of their TV Everywhere offering.\"\n\nBrannon added that companies, such as Comcast, which have been more willing to negotiate terms with content owners, have a broader TV Everywhere portfolio.\n\n\"TV Everywhere is an essential feature in all video carriage negotiations these days,\" he said. \"There is an inherent trade-off between features versus cost, but all cable video services are under pressure to get these deals done.\"\n\nBetter broadband\n\nVideo isn't the only area in which Time Warner Cable customers can expect to see improvements. Comcast also has been a leader among cable operators in driving higher broadband speeds. It was one of the first cable operators to deploy Docsis 3.0 technology standards, which offer more capacity on broadband networks.\n\nWhile Google has made a splash over the past year with its 1Gbps high-speed Internet service in Kansas City and is now expanding to additional markets, Comcast was the first cable operator to demonstrate a 1Gbps speed download over a traditional HFC, or hybrid fiber-coaxial, network. And at last year's National Cable and Telecommunications conference, the company showed off a 3Gbps download.\n\nToday, the fastest broadband service Comcast offers widely is 105Mbps, which is about double the speed that Time Warner is offering in most of its market. That said, Time Warner is offering a 100Mbps service in Kansas City, where not-so-coincidentally Google has deployed its 1Gpbs service. Time Warner Cable also will offer 100Mbps service in Austin, Texas, where AT&T and Google have each pledged to build 1Gbps fiber networks.\n\nOf course, some people have questioned why Comcast, which has shown off technology for achieving gigabit-speed broadband, hasn't offered such speeds itself. It's a valid question that I've asked myself. The company claims there isn't enough consumer demand. And indeed at the high prices Comcast and other cable operators are likely to charge for these super high-speed connections, that is likely the case.\n\nBut given the fact that Time Warner Cable has never been considered a leader in terms of broadband speeds, it's hard to argue that through its merger with Comcast, the market would be losing a competitive force that is driving the industry toward higher-speed connections.\n\nRather, I would argue that the telephone companies -- AT&T and Verizon Communications -- and to a much lesser extent, Google, are providing more incentive to all cable operators to increase their network speeds. Comcast actually faces less competition in its markets from Google and the phone companies than Time Warner Cable, and the increased exposure to this threat could spur faster improvement in the network.\n\n\"AT&T and Verizon are exerting tremendous pressure on the cable operators,\" Brannon said. \"In many ways their technology is superior to the cable operators'.\"\n\nJoe Raedle\/Getty Images\n\nIf there is a downside to the deal for consumers, it's that one company would have unprecedented control over which cable channels can and can't be seen by millions of Americans, and even whether some independent programmers would be economically viable, Moffett said. This argument comes down to the fact that since Comcast will be controlling so many of the nation's TV subscribers and because it already controls a lot of the cable content via its acquisition of NBC Universal, the company will have much more negotiating power and in some cases control over programmers.\n\nDuring his interview at the Deutsche Bank conference, Marcus laughed off the idea that a combined company with greater purchasing power would cause programmers to suffer.\n\n\"I just find these types of concerns ironic, especially when programming costs in recent years have risen to a level that is greater than what the consumer market will bear,\" he said.\n\nThere are also fears that the merger would lead to a similar level of control over broadband networks, which Moffett pointed out raises its own set of concerns surrounding Net neutrality. Again, the fear is that Comcast will control so much of the nation's broadband infrastructure that it will force content providers to pay fees or threaten to block or intentionally slow traffic. But Moffett said that even these concerns are likely overblown.\n\n\"It is the broadband concerns that will likely attract the more visceral reactions,\" Moffett said. \"But truth be told, the rules governing anticompetitive behavior are probably already relatively well suited to prevent anything egregious, including almost any violations of Net neutrality, with or without Net neutrality-specific rules.\"","56":"A legal dispute is brewing between the city of Los Angeles and Time Warner Cable, which the city attorney claims failed to pay nearly $10 million in public access fees.

As we wrote back then, the controversy erupted after the enactment of the Digital Infrastructure and Video Competition Act of 2006 where incumbent cable operators transitioned from locally issued cable franchises to video service provider franchises issued by the state of California. The following year, Los Angeles updated its code to require each state-franchised video service provider within its borders pay a franchise fee of up to five percent of gross revenue plus a one percent PEG fee.\n\nSTORY: 5 Possible In-House Replacements for Disney's Anne Sweeney\n\nAt the time of the 2012 lawsuit, there was talk that TWC was taking the position of not being required to pay the PEG fee under \"grandfathered\" obligations. Against that contention, Los Angeles demanded $700,000 in money allegedly owed.\n\nFast forward to last September.\n\nThe two sides reached a settlement with each other. Here it is. The parties attempted to put the dispute behind them, citing among other things, money that \"could be put to better use\" than litigation and a respective \"desire to improve their overall relations.\"\n\n(Clarification: The LA City's Attorney's Office writes to us to let us know that the County, not the City, of Los Angeles, was responsible for the 2012 lawsuit.)\n\nFurther, the settlement obligated TWC to carry the \"County Channel,\" devoted to public-minded programming. As for money owed, LA kept a $143,046 payment already made by TWC but it doesn't appear there was any more money changing hands. LA released TWC from claims except for claims not known or suspected at the time of the agreement.\n\nNow comes the new lawsuit.\n\nThe city of LA is now painting TWC, which Comcast is attempting to acquire, as a company which \"has derived billions of dollars from its cable television franchise in the City of Los Angeles, yet stubbornly continues to flout its statutory obligations to compensate the City of Los Angeles fully for this privilege.\"\n\nDespite the statutory changes shifting the system from local to a state-wide cable franchising, LA is insisting that TWC be \"required to pay a franchise fee in lieu of rent for its use of the public right-of-way, that is, the privilege of placing its network of cable wires and boxes under the City's streets, on the City's telephone poles, in the City's neighborhoods.\"\n\nLA says after acquiring the cable services of the bankrupt Adelphia, TWC now controls over more than 90 percent of the area's cable television market, which the city says has \"been accompanied by allegations of unexpected rate hikes and sever disruption in the continuity and quality of service, among other wrongful consumer practices.\"\n\nThe complaint adds, \"To justify its actions in refusing to pay its franchise fee obligations, Time Warner contended -- incredibly and for the first time -- that it had never been obligated to provide much of the non-monetary support for the public access studios that the company operated up to and including 2008... Perhaps not by coincidence, TWC's precipitous and wrongful withholding of the franchise fee occurred less than eight weeks before the end of Los Angeles' 2010-2011 fiscal year, exacerbating the City's well-publicized fiscal crisis, and further reducing the City's ability to pay for its already diminished core services.\"\n\nTWC says it is \"disappointed\" the city has chosen to bring the lawsuit and believes it \"is without merit.\"\n\nE-mail: Eriq.Gardner@THR.com\n\nTwitter: @eriqgardner","67":"The city of Los Angeles is suing Time Warner Cable for nearly $10 million in allegedly unpaid franchise fees, a backlog that stretches back to 2010.\n\nIn a complaint filed Friday with the United States District Court for the Central District of California, city attorney Mike Feuer charged Time Warner Cable with bilking the municipality to the tune of $9.7 million, a sum that includes $7.19 million in unpaid 2010 and 2011 franchise fees and another $2.51 million in delinquent payments from the previous two years.\n\n\u201cTime Warner Cable has derived billions of dollars from its cable television franchise in the city of Los Angeles, yet stubbornly continues to flout its statutory obligations to compensate the city \u2026 fully for this privilege,\u201d the complaint reads, before going on to note that the cable operator generates \u201cmore than $1 billion in revenue every two years from the residents of Los Angeles, a sum dwarfing the fees it is required to pay the city in return.\u201d\n\nThe city\u2019s attorneys said that the unpaid franchise fees and Public, Educational, Government use fees represent millions that could be put to use to pay firefighter and police officer salaries and maintain parks and libraries.\n\nWhile the charges in the suit are characteristically byzantine, the city\u2019s central argument would appear to boil down to the \u201cprecipitous and wrongful withholding\u201d of contractually owed monies.

With the system being stressed by massive boomer retirements (some estimate 10,000 per day) and a trust fund projected to run out of funds sometime in the early 2030s, how great is the impact of these creative filing strategies? Before looking at this question, let\u0092s review the two strategies.\n\nIn file and suspend, the higher-wage earner files for benefits at age 66 in order to let the lower-wage-earner spouse start collecting spousal benefits. The higher-wage earner, however, immediately suspends his or her filing in order to accrue delayed retirement credits until age 70. This odd-sounding file-and-suspend strategy allows the lower-wage earner to collect one half of the higher-wage-earner benefits and lets the higher earner commence greatly enhanced benefits at age 70. This strategy primarily benefits couples where the higher-wage earner makes much more than the lower-wage earner. If their earnings\u0092 histories are similar, there is little benefit to file and suspend.\n\nIn \u0093claim now, claim more later\u0094, the higher earner files a restricted Social Security claim for spousal benefits only, so that he or she can collect a spousal benefit based on the work history of the lower earner. Then, at 70, the higher-wage earner files for his or her own greatly enhanced benefit. This strategy provides an even greater benefit for the couples where earnings\u0092 histories are similar, which is more often the case today.\n\nThe Social Security Administration funded research to look a range of issues, including the cost to the system of people using these planning strategies. This research was partially reported in an article that appeared in the Journal of Financial Planning in August 2013. The research found that the cost of the \u0093file and suspend\u0094 strategy to the Social Security system is very small, only about $0.5 billion per year. For perspective, in 2012 the Social Security Administration paid out $645 billion in retirement benefits and the Social Security Trust Fund had over $2.8 trillion in savings at the end of 2013, according to the Social Security Administration\u0092s website.\n\nThis relatively small system cost of file and suspend may be attributed to two primary factors. File and suspend, for all the attention that it has garnered, provides only modestly enhanced benefits, less than $2,000 gains in lifetime benefits for a typical couple. Secondly, the strategy only benefits a small percentage (27%) of current couples, those where the higher-wage earner\u0092s earnings were far greater than that of the lower-wage earner. The cost of this strategy to the Social Security Administration would have been greater for an earlier generation of Americans when many women did not work or had very low lifetime earnings.\n\nThe research found that the \u0093claim now, claim more later\u0094 strategy could benefit many more couples, with a higher cost to the Social Security Administration of approximately $23.3 billion per year if all couples fully optimize their file strategies. Fortunately for the Social Security system, but not the average couples, most couples do not optimize their strategies and leave significant money on the table. Based on real-life reported behavior, it\u0092s estimated that the real cost to the Social Security Administration would be closer to only $9.7 billion per year. I would expect that with greater public awareness of these strategies and more educated financial planners this number should increase in the coming years but only time will tell.\n\nWith total income for Social Security Retirement and Survivors programs of $731 billion in 2012, the cost of these claiming strategies seems modest yet Congress will eventually be forced to look for ways to balance future balance sheets as the Trust Fund gets spent down. These juicy strategies could be on the chopping block but, for now, they may provide some real benefits to your clients.\n\nPaul Norr is a financial planner in Thousand Oaks, Calif., and writes about planning and retirement.

Unfortunately, she also made some inaccurate and misleading statements. (See Michael Hiltzik in the Los Angeles Times for details.)\n\nAs the saying goes, we are entitled to our own opinions but not to our own facts. We have written this open letter in order to ask for a correction.\n\nDear Abby:\n\nWe're writing you as members of two different generations -- Boomer and Millennial -- to ask you for an on-air correction to your recent segment on \"The Cycle\" focused on millennial and earned benefit programs. It was frustrating to see you unquestioningly repeat so many misleading talking points about one of our nation's most successful programs: Social Security.\n\nEven more importantly, it was disappointing to see you repeat the phony claim that there is a \"generational war\" between the young and the old. The real \"war\" in this country is between the haves and the have-nots, and it's no secret who's winning that one. In fact, this notion of a \"generational war\" was dreamed up in the think tanks and PR firms of billionaires, so that credulous journalists, politicians, and yes, news anchors, would pick it up and repeat it endlessly.\n\nMission accomplished: many of them have. Fortunately, you have a great platform for correcting the record. Here's where you can start:\n\nDuring your discussion of Social Security, you claimed that we need to increase the retirement age -- by as much as 10 years -- because life expectancies are about 20 years longer than they were in 1935. But when you factor out the large number of Americans who died young (often of childhood diseases) in the 1930s, and only take into account life expectancy after 65, our lives have been extended only by an average of about six years -- and these gains have disproportionately gone to wealthier Americans.\n\nCurrently, the \"full retirement\" age is 66 (it is gradually being raised to 67), but 41 percent of men and 46 percent of women take Social Security at 62, the earliest possible age. Starting Social Security at 62 means that their monthly benefits will be smaller for the rest of their lives, but millions of Americans have no other choice. They have health problems and cannot continue to work at physically demanding jobs, or they are unable to find employment due to age discrimination and the stagnant economy. Raising the retirement age is a Social Security benefit cut. If we increased it to 75, as you advocate, most people would still take Social Security much earlier and end up with drastically reduced lifetime benefits.\n\nYou maintained that we need to cut Social Security, or else there will be \"nothing left\" when it comes time for millennials to retire. The truth is that Social Security can pay out full benefits through 2033, and 75 percent of benefits through 2087. Removing the payroll tax cap so that millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share would close most of Social Security's modest funding gap. Instituting a small and incremental increase in the payroll tax (as has been done many times before, as the nation's wealth increases) would close the gap entirely, and allow us to expand benefits. There is no reason to think millennials will not receive 100 percent of promised benefits -- as long as the anti-Social Security forces do not succeed in gutting the program in the name of \"saving\" it.\n\nLet's be real here. We know that Social Security cuts aren't likely to affect baby boomers nearly as much as they will the generations that follow -- particularly millennials. So why push the idea that old people are greedy, when all that does is provide ammunition for an argument that will be used to shaft your fellow young people?\n\nAgain, we know who's getting all the national wealth, and it's not old people. Let's look at the facts: in 2012, the average Social Security benefit was $13,648, or $1137 a month. And that's the average -- for workers with low earning, or those (primarily women) who take time out of the workforce to perform caregiving work, benefits are often much lower. For two-thirds of beneficiaries, Social Security makes up half their income or more.\n\nAbby, you're fortunate enough to have been born into a well off family. Unfortunately, most Americans are not so lucky. The richest one percent of Americans control over 35 percent of our country's wealth, a massively outsized share of the economic pie. These plutocrats are working mightily to distract the 99 percent by turning them against each other -- men vs. women, whites vs. minorities, and as in this case, young vs. old. Young, socially progressive, moderates like you should know better than to play into these divisive, dangerous and disingenuous lies.\n\nWe're writing you together because we know that the generations should fight for these programs together. Younger Richard (we tried to call him \"Little Richard,\" but he didn't know who that was) has no desire to throw his parents and grandparents overboard to serve the agenda of the rich. Older Richard (he's not comfortable being described as \"Big Richard\" for reasons he'd rather not discuss) wants to protect these programs through the generations that will follow his.\n\nInstead of fighting against each other, it is time for all generations to come together and fight inequality by demanding more aid for children, seniors, and down on their luck Americans of all ages. These expansions can be funded by ending special tax breaks for corporations, asking the wealthy to pay their fair share, and making targeted cuts to the bloated Pentagon budget.\n\nAnd before we go, let's not forget student loan debt, crushingly high unemployment rates, and low-wage-no-benefit jobs, which are \"the norm\" amongst younger Americans. With no solutions in sight from Congress, Social Security is more important than ever for young folks.\n\nNow that you have the facts, we hope that you'll tell the truth and stop buying into deceptive arguments designed to mislead the American people.\n\nFollow Richard (RJ) Eskow on Twitter: www.twitter.com\/rjeskow\n\nFollow Richard Fowler on Twitter: www.twitter.com\/RichardAFowler","74":"NEW YORK, March 15 (UPI) -- U.S. adults favor raising the eligibility age for Social Security and Medicare or encouraging people to work past age 65 given the options on the table.\n\nThe Harris Poll gave survey respondents five choices and asked what they thought should happen over the next five years to meet the increasing costs of baby boomers retiring while controlling the federal budget deficit.\n\nThirty-seven percent chose increasing the age at which one is eligible for Social Security and Medicare, while the same percentage favored encouraging people 65 and older to work past the age of 65.\n\nThe survey of 2,266 U.S. adults conducted online Feb. 12 to 17 found roughly one-fourth favored increasing taxes while 1-in-10 said Medicare benefits should be cut and 7 percent said Social Security benefits should be cut.\n\nWhen asked which two of the five policy options people would choose if they had to pick two, the overall percentages grow but the rankings remained relatively unchanged. Fifty-four percent favored encouraging more more people to work at age 65 and older, while 53 percent favored increasing the age of eligibility, 36 percent wanted to increase taxes, while 9 percent said they preferred reducing Medicare benefits and 8 percent preferred cutting Social Security benefits.\n\nWhile substantial differences existed along political divisions whether taxes should increase, the real news is Americans across both party and philosophical lines show no significant differences from one another in their support of the top two courses of action.\n\nThirty-nine percent of Republicans, 35 percent of Democrats and 40 percent of independents said the age of eligibility should be raised. Many baby boomers already don't become eligible for full Social Security benefits until age 66. Reduced benefits begin at age 62.\n\nThirty-nine percent of independents, 38 percent of Democrats and 33 percent of Republicans said people should be encouraged to work past age 65.\n\nNo margin of error was provided.","75":"Public pension programmes around the world are in financial trouble. Because of continuing increases in life expectancy, the number of eligible retirees is rising more rapidly than the tax revenue available to finance benefits.\n\n\n\nIn the United States, the Congressional Budget Office projects the relative cost of the programme's old-age pension benefits to rise by more than a quarter over the next 25 years, from 4.9 per cent of gross domestic product, or GDP, today to 6.2 per cent in 2038. Because the taxes that are earmarked to support do not automatically rise faster than GDP, either the growth rate of benefits must be reduced or tax rates must be increased.\n\nOne reason for the rapid rise in benefits stems from how they are adjusted for Under current law, retirees' benefits are automatically adjusted to account for increases in the traditional consumer price index (CPI). But experts have long understood that the overstates the true increase in the cost of living, and that the resulting over-indexing of benefits should be fixed.Part of the problem is that the does not reflect how consumers change the composition of their purchases over time as relative prices change. President Barack Obama's administration initially followed expert advice and suggested that the traditional be replaced by a more accurate measure known as the chain-weighted Although this would reduce the annual rate of increase in benefits by only about 0.25 per cent, outlays for and other inflation-indexed programmes over the next 10 years would be more than $200 billion lower. Applying the chain-weighted to tax-bracket adjustments would raise more than $100 billion over the same period.But there is another, more fundamental reason why the traditional overstates the true rise in the cost of living: it does not accurately reflect the introduction of new goods and services or improvements in the quality of existing goods and services. So it is unfortunate that Mr Obama recently withdrew his proposal to change the traditional index, preferring the political gesture of \"protecting benefits\" to the more responsible policy of correcting the way that benefits and taxes reflect rising prices.The Congress responded in 1983 by gradually raising the age for full benefits from 65 to 67. Individuals who want to retire as early as 62 can still do so with an actuarially fair reduction in their benefits. Alternatively, they can work longer and receive higher benefits.Of course, the decision to increase the age for full benefits was never going to be politically popular. Congress was, therefore, careful to delay the start of the gradual adjustment, applying it only to those below the age of 45 at the time of the legislation, with the higher age to be fully phased in only in 2027.As a result, the public was generally unaware during the decade after the 1983 legislation that the age for full benefits would eventually rise. When pollsters asked voters whether they would favour an increase in the age to improve the programme's financial stability, the response was overwhelmingly negative.But here is the politically important fact: at no time did any member of Congress propose that the legislation be changed to delay or eliminate the rise in the eligibility age for full benefits. Congress acted responsibly to slow the growth of benefits, even though reversing the increase in the eligibility age would have been politically popular.Since the 1983 legislation was enacted, at age 67 has increased by another three years, bringing it to 85. There is every reason to expect to continue to rise in the future at the rate of one year per decade.The obvious solution to the current and future financing problem is to reprise the 1983 legislation by gradually raising the age for full benefits from 67 to 70, with appropriate actuarial adjustments for earlier and later retirements. Because at age 67 is roughly 18 years, this would be equivalent to reducing average lifetime benefits by one-sixth (the present value of the benefit reduction is actually higher, given that the reduction comes at the start of the period).It would be even better to avoid future political posturing by enacting legislation now that automatically raises the eligibility age for full benefits in such a way that average at that threshold is kept constant, at 15 years.Some experts object on principle to an increase in the eligibility age for full benefits, because some low-income groups do not experience the same one-year-per-decade rise in A simple solution to that problem would be to relate the age at which full benefits are paid to each individual's average lifetime earnings.A more fundamental reform would be to shift from a pure pay-as-you-go system to a mixed system that combines the current benefits with investment-based personal accounts. Such investment-based annuities would be a natural supplement to the lower pay-as-you-go benefits that would result from raising the eligibility age for full benefits.Obviously, retirees deserve advance notice before benefits are reduced. That is why it is important for the - and for many countries around the world - to act now to make the changes needed to stabilise future pension finances.\n\n\n\nThe writer is professor of economics at Harvard University.\n\nProject Syndicate, 2014","76":"It\u2019s a benefit you\u2019ve been purchasing your entire working life, but like legions of other Americans, you may not be aware of exactly what you\u2019ve bought and, more importantly, the options and strategies you have for redeeming it.

But there is a statement.\n\nIt All Starts With the Statement\n\nYour road to a better understanding of Social Security begins with one four-page report, your Social Security Statement.\n\nThe Social Security Administration (SSA) prepares and maintains statements for every person over the age of 25 who has paid into the system. You may or may not be aware of this, because the SSA has changed (more than once) its method of distributing the statement in recent years.\n\nStarting in October of 1999, the statement was mailed to you every year. No need to request it; it just came. Today, after a series of changes, fits and starts in 2011 and 2012, the only way to access your statement is to visit www.ssa.gov and sign up for a \u201cMy Social Security\u201d account.\n\nWhy should I go to the trouble, you ask? Well, the statement contains some pretty important stuff:\n\n1. Your Earnings History. Found on page 3 of the statement, this is a record of every dollar you\u2019ve paid into the Social Security system. You will want to check this for accuracy because it will determine the approximate amount of your monthly SS check once you start collecting benefits. Your earnings are listed year by year, and the SSA will use the best 35 of those to determine your benefit. If you find an error, contact SSA and get it fixed!\n\n2. Your Estimated Benefits. Found on page 2 of the statement, this is an estimate of how much money you may get at age 62 (currently the earliest eligibility age), at full retirement age and at age 70. Importantly, this is only an estimate and is subject to change. It assumes you will work to your collection age and continue earning whatever you did last year. Generally speaking, the closer you are to retirement, the more accurate your estimate may be.\n\n3. Program Summary. A letter summarizing the health of the program is included on page 1 of your statement. This year\u2019s letter estimates that the system can meet all future liabilities through 2032. If nothing changes between now and then, benefits will need to be cut by 23% starting in 2033.","77":"Dear Liz: I am 55 and my wife is 65. She only worked a few part-time jobs as she spent most of her working years raising our nine beautiful children. My question is, since she does not have enough credits to collect Social Security on her own work record, can she claim spousal benefits on my work history? If so, at what age and how will it affect my benefits?\n\nAnswer: Your wife can receive spousal benefits based on your work record, but those checks can't start until you're old enough to qualify for benefits at age 62 (when she's 72).\n\nIf you apply at 62, however, you're typically locked into a check that would be about 30% smaller than what you'd get if you waited until your \"full retirement age\" to start. Full retirement age used to be 65, but it's now 66 and will gradually increase to 67 for people born in 1960 or later.\n\nAt your full retirement age, you have the option to \"file and suspend,\" in which you file for retirement benefits and then immediately suspend your application. Your wife can start receiving spousal benefits, but because you aren't actually receiving checks, your benefit can continue to grow until it maxes out at age 70.\n\nFor many couples, it makes sense for the higher earner to delay starting benefits as long as possible. Given your big age gap, however, you may be better off with a hybrid approach: starting your own benefits (and your wife's spousal benefit) at age 62 and then suspending your benefit when you reach full retirement age, said economist Laurence Kotlikoff, a Boston University professor who created the site MaximizeMySocialSecurity.com to help people analyze their claiming options. Your benefit would grow 8% a year from the time you suspend to the time you restart at age 70. Your wife would continue to receive her spousal benefit in the interim.\n\nBecause your wife will be older than her own full retirement age of 66 when she starts receiving checks, she will be entitled to half of the benefit you're scheduled to get at your full retirement age. What she gets doesn't diminish what you get. Spouses who haven't reached their full retirement age when they apply for spousal benefits have to settle for a discounted check.\n\nClearly, claiming decisions can be complicated, especially for married people and even more so when there's a big gap in their ages. AARP has a free calculator that can help most people understand their options. T. Rowe Price also has an easy-to-use calculator, but it doesn't work for married couples with more than a six-year age gap.\n\nFor a more detailed and customizable calculator, you may want to pay $40 to use the software at sites such as MaximizeMySocialSecurity.com or SocialSecurityChoices.com, co-developed by economist (and Social Security recipient) Russell F. Settle.\n\nCharitable giving can help keep tax deductions steady\n\nDear Liz: Regarding the reader who was worried about not having sufficient tax deductions: I recommend charitable giving. As our mortgage interest per payment fell, I augmented it with charitable giving to maintain the same annual total for income tax deductions (interest plus charity). As the years go by, our interest decreases and charity increases. Payments to charity accomplish a social benefit, while interest payments just line the pockets of bankers. We give to a broad variety of charities: national, local and international organizations, religious and secular, health and social care, care for children at risk, veterans, Red Cross, etc. The great thing about charitable giving is that we get to choose whom we wish to help. When asked, most organizations will keep your demographic information private so that you are not inundated with requests via the sale of donor lists.\n\nAnswer: Thanks for sharing your approach, but people should understand that it requires paying out more money over time to maintain the same level of itemized deductions.\n\nMortgage payments typically remain the same over the life of the loan, with the amount of potentially deductible interest shrinking and the amount applied to the principal increasing with each payment. So as the amount of deductible interest declines, you would have to increase your contributions to charity in addition to making your mortgage payment each month if you wanted to keep your itemized deductions unchanged.\n\nQuestions may be sent to Liz Weston, 3940 Laurel Canyon, No. 238, Studio City, CA 91604, or by using the \"Contact\" form at asklizweston.com.

Social Security retirement benefits were received by nine of 10 people age 65 or older during 2012 and were a major source of income for more than two-thirds of retirees.\n\nIt might not be surprising in light of the financial challenges Americans have faced during the past few years, but the percentage of people claiming Social Security retirement benefits at the earliest possible age increased by more than 2 percentage points between 2007 and 2009. According to one expert, 41 percent of men and 46 percent of women receive the smallest possible retirement benefit available to them because they claimed early at age 62.\n\nWhile some Americans might have had little choice about when to claim benefits, it\u2019s important for those who do claim these benefits to plan and make informed decisions because Social Security retirement benefits are more complex than many understand.\n\nIs it worth the effort?\n\nSome Americans are skeptical about whether Social Security benefits will be available when they reach retirement age. Social Security\u2019s reserves, which were built up over three decades when the system took in more revenue than it paid out, are expected to be depleted sometime in the early 2030s. Once reserves run out, the tax revenue that funds Social Security will cover only three-fourths of scheduled benefits.\n\nThere are a variety of options that might help keep Social Security viable, including revising benefit formulas, raising taxes, raising the cap on taxable income, increasing retirement age, or some combination of all of these. Regardless of the challenge and the expense, the vast majority of Americans want to see the program continue, according to a 2013 study by the Pew Research Center. In fact, 90 percent of Americans want spending on Social Security to remain as it is or increase.\\\n\nAmericans\u2019 reasons for wanting to preserve Social Security often are personal. However, AARP recently argued there are economic reasons for keeping the program in place, as well. A study released by the AARP Public Policy Institute suggested Social Security payments during 2012 supported about 9.2 million jobs; $1.4 trillion in economic output (goods and services); $774 billion in value added (gross domestic product); $370 billion in salaries, wages and other compensation; and $222 billion in tax revenues for local, state, and federal governments.","79":"In the retirement planning space, there are two realities.\n\nThe first consists of spreadsheets, calculators and frightening rules of thumb to guide workers and retirees in their saving and spending decisions.\n\nThe other reality exists in the space where Mom and Pop Retiree actually live. That is the true reality, the one you\u2019ll probably be living in yourself when you leave your last job.\n\nIt is little examined, despite the heavy volume of regularly published reports on retirement expectations and projections.\n\nYet we know a few things about the way real people actually retire. Typically, they haven\u2019t saved 25 times their annual spending, as is often recommended. Nor do they switch fromstocks to bonds on the day they retire, which incidentally is probably before they reach the Social Security Administration\u2019s \u201cfull retirement age\u201d of 66.\n\nThey don\u2019t carefully calculate their monthly spending plans based on their Excel spreadsheets (unless they are engineers). They don\u2019t change their personalities when they retire. They typically enjoy retirement life and enjoy participating in the same kinds of activities that gave them pleasure before they retired.\n\nWorkers should plan and prepare for retirement. But they\u2019re more likely to succeed if they plan for what actually lies ahead. Here are a few things we know to be true about retirement now.\n\n\u2013 Reality: You\u2019ll spend less than you think. But only after you spend more than you think.\n\nMuch is made of the idea that you need to plan on spending 80 percent to 100 percent of the amount you spend in your final years of work. But that isn\u2019t even close to true. Most people spend a lot in their first year or two of retirement when they take long deferred trips, fix up the house, invest in hobbies and the like.\n\nBut over time, retiree spending drops substantially. Households headed by people over the age of 75 spend just 72 percent of what households headed by people between the ages of 65 and 74 do, and they spend just 63 percent of what households headed by people 55-64 do, according to an analysis of U.S. Department of Labor figures by J.P. Morgan Asset Management. The firm recently did a wide-ranging review of retirement practices. Household spending actually peaks in households led by 48 year olds; their spending is almost cut in half by the time they are over 75.\n\n\u2013 Reality: You won\u2019t work until you are 70. Now, workers are regularly told that they will benefit greatly if they work until they are 70, and hold off until that age before collecting Social Security benefits. That\u2019s true \u2013 but not very realistic.\n\nIn fact, fewer than 2 percent of retirees make it to 70 before they start drawing on Social Security, JPMorgan found. The average retirement age is 61, according to a recent Gallup survey. Many people who intend to work until they are 70 find themselves pushed out of jobs or having to retire for health reasons far earlier than they expect. Given this reality, it\u2019s smart for early retirees to get professional help figuring out whether they are better off drawing down savings and deferring Social Security benefits or starting those benefits earlier and protecting their savings.\n\n\u2013 Reality: Your spending won\u2019t be stable and you may not want your income to be. Retirees spend much of their money in chunks. They buy a car one year, take a trip in another, reach into their savings to help grandchildren go to college. Sometimes they have lean years, where they stay home and concentrate on their gardens and reading. As their health falters, they spend large sums of money in short amounts of time paying for care.\n\nRetirees also don\u2019t inflate their spending on an annual basis to match the Consumer Price Index, investment firm T. Rowe Price has found. They tend to hold savings withdrawals somewhat stable from one year to the next. And they do allow their spending to be somewhat responsive to market returns, cinching those belts tighter after losing years and spending a little more freely after experiencing high returns.\n\nThat means that a proper retirement nest egg allows for that variability \u2013 it keeps some money liquid and doesn\u2019t tie up too much in annuity products that pay out the same amount of money month in and month out.\n\nJP Morgan Asset Management\u2019s chief findings were in this area. It found that the so-called 4 percent rule of thumb for retirement withdrawals may not be the best way to calculate them. Retirees willing to adjust their withdrawals annually based on market returns, and willing to forego annual inflation adjustments can actually start their retirements withdrawing 5 percent or more of assets in their first year of retirement, depending on their age.\n\n\u2013 You probably won\u2019t run out of money. Most retirees don\u2019t spend blithely at a pre-conceived rate until their larders are empty and the money\u2019s all gone. They constrain their spending more gradually to match their resources. Those people who do literally run out of money tend to be older, sicker people who depend upon Medicaid funding to pay for costly nursing home care.\n\n\u2013 Reality: You\u2019ll have fun. It doesn\u2019t take huge amounts of money to build a successful retirement, and in fact, happiness doesn\u2019t always build along with individual retirement account balances. In the JP Morgan Asset management research, the amount of increased satisfaction that a retiree gets seems to flatten once their spending tops $40,000 a year. Some 68 percent of retirees in a 2011 Consumer Reports survey said they were \u201chighly satisfied\u201d with their retirement lives. Reality: The best things in life are free.","80":"President Barack Obama wants to eliminate, as part of his proposed fiscal year 2015 budget, aggressive Social Security claiming strategies \u201cwhich allow upper-income beneficiaries to manipulate the timing of collection of Social Security benefits to maximize delayed retirement credits.\u201d\n\nNow, that plan to stop upper-income beneficiaries from claiming and then suspending their Social Security benefit may or may not become a reality. But what remains a reality, at least for now, is this: The incentive for waiting to claim Social Security until age 70.\n\nAnd that incentive, according to a series of just-released fact sheets and the like from National Association of Social Insurance, is significant.\n\nConsider: If you claim Social Security at age 62 you\u2019ll get just 75% of the monthly benefit you would have received had you waited until full retirement age. But if you wait until age 70, you\u2019ll get 132% of what would have been your full retirement age benefit. Or put another way, if your full retirement age benefit is $1,000 a month, you\u2019d get just $750 a month if you claim at age 62, or $1,320 if you wait until age 70.\n\nHow to make sense of mixed sentiment signals (3:57) The consumer-sentiment report showed sentiment was weaker than expected in March. Does that mean anything for stocks? Not as much as you might think. Spencer Jakab explains on MoneyBeat.\n\nThe decision about when to claim Social Security decision is, for most people, not an easy one. To do it right, you need to consider many factors and answer many questions, some of which are, frankly, unanswerable.\n\nWhat are some of those factors and questions? Well, the NASI addressed many of the factors and questions in its just-released tool kit, Social Security: It Pays to Wait, which includes, a three-minute video: Social Security: It Pays To Wait; a one-page fact sheet, When Should I Take Social Security?; and a 16-page brief, When Should I Take Social Security? Questions to Consider.\n\nTo be sure, it\u2019s well worth reading and studying the NASI\u2019s tool kit. It\u2019s also worth learning what experts participating in an email discussion had to say about the NASI\u2019s tool kit and what they think beneficiaries need to consider before taking Social Security.\n\n1. Take it seriously\n\nFirst, what\u2019s especially difficult about the when-to-claim-Social Security decision is that you have to decide what to do early in your 60s, long before you know the answers to your questions about your health and life expectancy. And two, the decision is irrevocable.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, some decisions have to be made early in the game, such as the decision about when to take Social Security, or what option to take from the defined benefit plan, and once made, are generally irrevocable,\u201d said Chuck Yanikoski, the president of Still River Retirement Planning Software and RetirementWORKS.\n\n\u201cOther decisions can be put off, or modified, but once made limit one\u2019s future choices. So the further a person gets into retirement, the fewer options they have \u2014 and not only because of past decisions that they can\u2019t take back, but because of declining health, fewer or no opportunities for re-employment, possibly declining asset balances, and generally no likelihood of other new sources of income or assets.\u201d\n\nYes, there\u2019s a continuing need to reassess and modify your plan as things change during retirement, but that cannot be an excuse for not doing the best possible job at retirement, Yanikoski said.\n\n\u201cPlanning around the time of retirement has a much bigger impact than individual course corrections during retirement, so it is best to do that planning as if you were only going to get one shot at it,\u201d Yanikoski said.\n\n2. Don\u2019t use your break-even age\n\nAdvisers sometimes suggest, as part of the process, that you ought to determine the age at which you would come out ahead if you delay Social Security. In other words, the experts want you to determine your break-even age.\n\nNow the break-even age, according to an analysis by Rande Spiegelman, a vice president of financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, depends on the amount of your benefits and the assumptions you use to account for taxes and the opportunity cost of waiting.\n\nIn his analysis, Spiegelman calculated the break-even ages for a top wage earner turning 62 in 2013 with monthly benefits (in 2013 dollars) at ages 62 and one month of $1,923; 66, $2,591; and 70, $3,447. And what he found was this: The break-even age is between:\n\n77 and 78 for the top wage earner deciding whether to take Social Security early at age 62 vs. at age 66, the full retirement age (FRA);\n\n80 and 81 for those deciding whether to take Social Security early at age 62 or at age 70; and\n\n83 and 84 for those deciding whether to take Social Security at FRA vs. at age 70.\n\nRead When Should You Take Social Security?\n\nResearch, however, shows the Social Security Administration\u2019s historical use of \u201cbreak-even analysis\u201d has the effect of inducing individuals to retire early, according to Jeff Brown, a professor at the University of Illinois.\n\nRead Framing effects and expected social security claiming behavior, which is research Brown conducted with Arie Kapteyn, a senior economist at the Rand Corp. and Olivia Mitchell, a professor at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nSo instead of using a break-even analysis, Brown recommends using \u201calternative frames,\u201d much more in the spirit of how the NASI does this in its toolkit. That sort of framing, he said, increases intended claiming ages by 18 to 24 months.\n\nIndeed, in its tool kit, the NASI suggests that older Americans consider not their break-even age, but their life expectancy when deciding when to take Social Security. For instance, the NASI notes that an average 65-year-old male can expect to live 19 more years, to age 84, while an average 65-year-old female can expect to live about 22 more years, to age 87. In addition, the NASI suggests that nearly four in 10 women and three in 10 men age 65 today can expect to reach age 90.\n\n3. Focus more on longevity risk\n\nBrown, however, suggest that those trying to decide when to claim Social Security focus less on average life expectancy and more on the odds of living a long time. \u201cMy concern about focusing on life expectancy rather than the full distribution of longevity possibilities is that one could inadvertently put people back into the mind-set of thinking in terms of break-even dates, rather than thinking about the sustainability of consumption,\u201d said Brown. \u201cIndeed, one of my pet peeves about financial planners (and financial planning software) is that they rarely discuss longevity \u2018risk\u2019 as opposed to average life expectancy.\u201d\n\nSaid Brown: \u201cAn arbitrary extension of life expectancy \u2018to be conservative\u2019 is not a substitute for a fulsome discussion of longevity risk. If one does not explicitly consider the risk around average life expectancy, then one will never see why an annuity is an appropriate solution. It would be like trying to sell fire insurance, but instead of discussing the risk that your house will burn down, you only point out that on average 1% of everyone\u2019s house will burn once a year.\u201d\n\nOthers, however, have a different point of view. The Social Security decision is significantly different from some other longevity issues,\u201d said Yanikoski. \u201cFinancial planners need to look at extra-long life scenarios, because they are, usually, trying to figure out how to amortize savings \u2014 and obviously, a planned amortization using life expectancy leaves 50% of people in a catastrophe.\u201d\n\nSocial Security isn\u2019t like that, he said. \u201cNone of the choices leads to a catastrophic outcome, regardless of what happens,\u201d Yanikoski said. \u201cSo with Social Security the task is not to avoid catastrophe, but to optimize the chance of getting the best result. And the way to do that is to plan around the most likely longevity outcome.\u201d\n\n4. Consider personalized life expectancy\n\nOther experts, meanwhile, say factoring life expectancy into the Social Security-claiming decision is important, but that it needs to be personalized. \u201cWhat is conspicuously absent, however, is that many people, roughly 50%, do not live to their life expectancy or longer,\u201d said Steve Mitchell, a consultant Oculus Partners and founder of Stephen W. Mitchell & Associates. \u201cThe important question that every potential beneficiary should ask that is totally missing from the discussion and most of our industry discussion on outliving retirement income is whether or not the overall average life expectancy is a good estimate of personal life expectancy, or are their personal health or family history factors that should be factored into the individual\u2019s decision.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mitchell, an important step for most considering the Social Security decision is to use a tool to estimate a \u201cpersonal\u201d life expectancy such as that found at the Living to 100 Life Expectancy Calculator. \u201cAt best, it\u2019s still just an estimate, but better than making a big financial decision based on broad population averages,\u201d he said.\n\nIn many cases, for those in good health, who don\u2019t smoke and who have good family history, Mitchell said calculating your personal life expectancy will reinforce the key message that you may live longer than you expect and Social Security becomes an increasingly important source of income as you get older. However, for others who are in poor health, and who have family history of premature death, and the like, Mitchell said the considerations are different. \u201cOf course for married couples, both spouses\u2019 expectancy need to be considered and some of the more complex Social Security claiming strategies may provide significant benefits,\u201d Mitchell said.\n\nThe exercise of creating a personalized life expectancy is a worthwhile one, but one shouldn\u2019t go overboard. In his practice, for instance, Yanikoski considers only sex, smoking status, and a five-level self-evaluation of current factors health.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s possible that pushing people to claim at age 70 might not be in their best interest. \u201cI think that it usually is not prudent to use exaggerated life expectancies to make Social Security decisions,\u201d said Yanikoski. \u201cAlthough it seems \u2018conservative\u2019 in terms of longevity risk, pushing Social Security claiming toward age 70 severely reduces short-term income in exchange for potential very-long-term future gains.\u201d\n\nFor people of modest financial means, Yanikoski said this is paying a big premium up front for the hope of future benefits, even when that hope is against the odds, to the extent they assume longer-than-normal life expectancy. \u201cIn my view, this is not conservative; it\u2019s risky and fundamentally imprudent gambling,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be encouraging it.\u201d\n\n5. Stay flexible\n\nOthers, meanwhile, remind us that retirement planning is not a once-and-done exercise. \u201cRetirement-income planning is not static and is not a one-time decision,\u201d said Diane Savage, a certified financial planner and educator. \u201cIt requires attention throughout retirement with many course adjustments, if you will.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo many of the factors related to retirement-income management are not controllable even though we like to think they are,\u201d she said. \u201cIt appears to me that there are many attempts to create certainty around something that is far from certain.\u201d\n\nThe best plans, she said, are those that provide some guaranteed income sources as well as other income sources that can adapt and move with forces beyond the control of the retiree. \u201cThis is the most appropriate path to provide more certainty for the retirement-income stream,\u201d said Savage. \u201cThe best advice someone planning their retirement income can be given is be prepared to be flexible.\u201d\n\nRead these related stories:\n\n7 worst 401(k) mistakes by retirement savers\n\nWant to retire?

Now, the age for receiving full benefits keeps moving higher. But, what about early retirement, a reader asks? The Social Security Q&A has the answer. It also provides more details for disabled veterans on the recent move to \u0093high priority\u0094 for disability assistance requests.\n\nQuestion:\n\nMy full retirement age is 66 years and 4 months because I was born in 1956. What is the earliest age I can begin receiving retirement benefits? Is it 62 or 62 and 4 months?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe earliest age you can begin receiving Social Security retirement benefits is 62. Although the full retirement age is increasing from age 66 to 67 for people born after 1954, you can still apply as early as age 62 regardless of what your full retirement age may be.\n\nIf you decide to receive benefits before your full retirement age, you will receive a reduced benefit. Keep in mind you will not be able to receive Medicare coverage until age 65, even if you decide to retire at an earlier age. You can learn more about the full retirement age on our this page at our website.\n\nQuestion:\n\nI am a disabled veteran. I have a compensation rating of 100% Permanent and Total from the Veteran\u0092s Administration. Will I automatically qualify to receive Social Security disability?\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo. You would have to apply for Social Security disability and go through the application process.\n\nYou may have heard where Social Security recently announced rules regarding an expedited process for processing disability applications filed by veterans with a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability compensation rating of 100% Permanent & Total (P&T).\n\nCarolyn W. Colvin, Acting Commissioner of Social Security recently unveiled a new initiative to expedite disability claims. Under the new process, Social Security will treat these veterans\u0092 applications as high priority and issue expedited decisions, similar to the way the agency currently handles disability claims from Wounded Warriors.\n\n\u0093Our veterans have sacrificed so much for our country and it is only right that we ensure they have timely access to the disability benefits they may be eligible for and deserve,\u0094 said Acting Commissioner Colvin.\n\n\u0093Social Security worked with Veterans Affairs to identify those veterans with disabilities who have a high probability of also meeting our definition of disability. I am proud of our collaboration and happy to announce this new service for America\u0092s vets.\u0094\n\nIn order to receive the expedited service, veterans must tell Social Security they have a VA disability compensation rating of 100% P&T and show proof of their disability rating with their VA Notification Letter. The VA rating only expedites Social Security disability claims processing and does not guarantee an approval for Social Security disability benefits. These veterans must still meet the strict eligibility requirements for a disability allowance.\n\nSocial Security plans to launch the expedited process in mid-March. For information about this service, please visit socialsecurity.gov\/pgm\/disability-pt.htm.\n\nFor more about Social Security\u0092s handling of Wounded Warrior\u0092s disability claims, visit socialsecurity.gov\/woundedwarriors.\n\nOscar Garcia is a Public Affairs Specialist with the Social Security Administration.

What many people don't know is how to actually come up with an accurate estimate of how much money you'll actually need. Here's a quick guide to help you get started on your planning.\n\nEstimate your annual expenses\n\nYou have probably heard of various estimates on how much of your previous income is needed to maintain a similar lifestyle in retirement, and around 75-85% seems to be the consensus. In other words, if your pre-retirement income is $100,000 per year, expect to draw around $75,000-$85,000 from your investments and other income sources.\n\nHowever, this is not a one-size-fits-all formula. If you were a big saver in your working life, for instance, you are already used to living on a lower percentage of your salary. If you were paying a mortgage and your home is now paid off, that is an expense that no longer needs to be considered. So, it is very possible that the annual income you'll need in retirement is much lower than you think.\n\nIn your pre-retirement planning, it helps to try and eliminate as many expenses as possible before you retire (like a mortgage). Sit down and list all of your monthly expenses and consider how they might change once you retire. For example, if you have a long commute to work, you'll certainly be spending a lot less on gas! Smaller expenses like that can really add up fast.\n\nThere have been studies that suggest that post-retirement expenses are not as much as experts think and that overall costs actually decline consistently after retiring. A recent study by the University of Michigan found that post-retirement spending is less than 60% of pre-retirement income, on average, so that is probably a more realistic goal to shoot for.\n\nDon't count on help!\n\nWhile your expenses may be less than you may think, one thing that you should not count on (especially if you are under 40) is Social Security. The SS program may indeed still be around, but likely at either a lower rate or higher retirement age. If Social Security does in fact still exist when you are ready to retire, it should be a bonus, not a core part of your plan.\n\nThe same can be said for employer-sponsored pensions. Pensions are an endangered species, especially in the private sector, and just like Social Security, benefit cuts and\/or increased retirement ages are becoming the norm.\n\nHow you want to invest\n\nThe idea of equating the word \"stocks\" with \"risk\" in retirement is a flawed one. Not all stocks are risky and volatile any more than all corporate bonds are perfectly safe. Now, I would stay away from volatile tech companies, but dividend-paying blue chip stocks should always make up a substantial portion of any retirement portfolio.\n\nBonds can be great for income, but for retirement investors truly in it for the long haul, the concept of \"total return\" is what will keep your portfolio growing in perpetuity. The S&P 500, for example, has averages a total return (dividends and share price appreciation) of just under 10% since 1926. Depending on the time period, an average of around 3-4% has come from dividend yields (income), with the rest coming from growth.\n\nIs the \"4% rule\" right for everyone?\n\nThe short answer is \"no\", but it can be a good starting point. The \"4% rule\" of retirement essentially says that if you withdraw 4% of your retirement portfolio per year and increase your withdrawals with inflation, your account will last for as long as you do.\n\nThe 4% rule should work if you have a healthy mix of investments, specifically, at least half of your money in dividend-stocks that will allow your portfolio to appreciate over time. If you decide that you need $60,000 per year in retirement, your \"number\" would be $1,500,000.\n\nThis amount could drop tremendously if you end up getting the same Social Security benefits that are around today or if you actually collect a pension in perpetuity, but as I said before, these situations should be thought of as a bonus, not as a core aspect of your retirement planning.","83":"Your access to this site has been limited\n\nYour access to this service has been temporarily limited.

I have a compensation rating of 100% Permanent and Total from the Veteran's Administration. Will I automatically qualify to receive Social Security disability?\n\nA: No. You would have to apply for Social Security disability and go through the application process.\n\nYou may have heard that Social Security recently announced rules regarding an expedited process for processing disability applications filed by veterans with a Department of Veterans Affairs disability compensation rating of 100% Permanent & Total, or P&T. Carolyn W. Colvin, acting commissioner of Social Security, recently unveiled a new initiative to expedite disability claims.\n\nUnder the new process, Social Security will treat these veterans' applications as high priority and issue expedited decisions, similar to the way the agency handles disability claims from wounded warriors.\n\n\u201cOur veterans have sacrificed so much for our country, and it is only right that we ensure they have timely access to the disability benefits they may be eligible for and deserve,\u201d Colvin said. \u201cSocial Security worked with Veterans Affairs to identify those veterans with disabilities who have a high probability of also meeting our definition of disability. I am proud of our collaboration and happy to announce this new service for America's vets.\u201d\n\nTo receive the expedited service, veterans must tell Social Security they have a VA disability compensation rating of 100% P&T and show proof of their disability rating with their VA notification letter.\n\nThe VA rating only expedites Social Security disability claims processing and does not guarantee an approval for Social Security disability benefits. These veterans still must meet the strict eligibility requirements for a disability allowance.\n\nSocial Security plans to launch the expedited process in mid-March. For information about this service, please visit www.socialsecurity.gov\/pgm\/disability-pt.htm. For more about Social Security's handling of wounded warriors' disability claims, visit www. socialsecurity.gov\/wounded warriors.\n\nQ: My full retirement age is 66 years and 4 months because I was born in 1956. What is the earliest age I can begin receiving retirement benefits? Is it 62, or 62 and 4 months?\n\nA: The earliest age you can begin receiving Social Security retirement benefits is 62. Although the full retirement age is increasing from age 66 to 67 for people born after 1954, you still can apply as early as age 62 regardless of what your full retirement age may be.\n\nIf you decide to receive benefits before your full retirement age, you will receive a reduced benefit. Keep in mind you will not be able to receive Medicare coverage until age 65, even if you decide to retire at an earlier age. You can learn more about the full retirement age on our website at www.social security.gov\/pubs\/ageincrease. htm.\n\nOscar Garcia is a public affairs specialist with the Social Security Administration.

Fate aside, it isn't merely a matter of stock market performance or investment selection that makes the difference. There are certain dos and don'ts \u2013 some less apparent than others \u2013 that tend to encourage retirement happiness and comfort.\n\nRetire financially literate. Some retirees don't know how much they don't know. They end their careers with inadequate financial knowledge, and yet feel that they can plan retirement on their own. They mistake retirement income planning for the whole of retirement planning, and gloss over longevity risk, risks to their estate, and potential health care expenses. The more you know, the more your retirement readiness improves.\n\nRetire knowing that you'll have to assume some risk. Growth investing is increasingly seen as a necessity for retirees who want to keep ahead of inflation.\n\nAccording to data and research compiled by the Social Security Administration, the average 65-year-old man will live to be 84 and the average 65-year-old woman will live to be 86. So that's a 20-year retirement. The SSA also notes that roughly a quarter of today's 65-year-olds will live past 90, and about 10 percent of them will live beyond age 95.1\n\nIf these seniors rely on fixed-income investments for the balance of their lives, they may end up with reduced retirement income potential, and in turn a reduced standard of living. Look at the Rule of 72: if an investment is yielding 2 percent, it will take about 36 years to double your money. Yes, interest rates are rising \u2013 but inflation should rise with them.\n\nA generation ago, mature Americans were urged to gradually shift their portfolio assets out of stocks and into fixed-income investments. One old rule of thumb was to subtract your age from 100, with the resulting number being the percentage of your portfolio you should assign to equities.\n\nToday, retirees and retirement planners are reconsidering this thinking. As the Wall Street Journal reported recently, one study of retirement money and longevity risk concluded that retirement funds may last longer if a retiree gradually increases the stock allocation within a portfolio about 1 percent per year from an initial range of between 20-50 percent to between 40-80 percent. The concept here is that a retiree's stock allocation should be lowest when their retirement nest egg is largest.\n\nRetire debt-free, or close to debt-free. Who wants to retire with 10 years of mortgage payments ahead or a couple of car loans to pay off? Even if your retirement savings are substantial, what will big debts do to your retirement morale and the possibilities on your retirement horizon? On that note, refrain from loaning money to family members and friends who seem quite capable of standing on their own two feet.\n\nIf the thought of using some of your retirement money to pay outstanding debts hits you, set that thought aside. You have dedicated that money to your future, not to bill paying. On second or third thought, other sources for the cash may be apparent.\n\nRetire with purpose. There's a difference between retiring and quitting. Some people can't wait to quit their job at 62 or 65 \u2013 their work is \"killing\" them, or boring them senseless. If only they could escape and just relax and do nothing for a few years \u2013 wouldn't that be a nice reward? Relaxation can lead to inertia, however \u2013 and inertia can lead to restlessness, even depression. You want to retire to a dream, not away from a problem.\n\nA retirement dream can become even more captivating when it is shared. Spouses who retire with a shared dream or with utmost respect for each other's dreams are in a good place.\n\nThe bottom line? Retirees who know what they want to do \u2013 and go out and do it \u2013 are contributing to their mental health and possibly their physical health. If they do something that is not only vital to them but important to others, their community can benefit as well.\n\nRetire healthy. Smoking, drinking, overeating, a dearth of physical activity \u2013 all these can take a toll on your capacity to live fully and enjoy retirement. It is never \"too late\" to quit smoking, quit drinking or slim down.\n\nRetire in a community where you feel at home. It could be where you live now; it could be a place hundreds or thousands of miles away where the scenery and people are uplifting. It could be the place where your children live. If you find yourself lonely in retirement, then \"find your tribe\" \u2013 look for ways to connect with people who share your experiences, interests and passions, and who encourage you and welcome you. This social interaction is one of the great intangible retirement benefits.\n\nRichard H Mootz, CFP?

The Transaction values Ono at a multiple of 7.5x 2013 EBITDA and 10.4x 2013 OpFCF, adjusted for cost and capex synergies.\n\nVodafone Group Chief Executive Vittorio Colao said the combination of Vodafone and ONO created a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represented an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone. \u201cDemand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction \u2013 together with our fibre-to-the-home build programme \u2013 will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market. We look forward to welcoming the management and employees of Ono to Vodafone and working together to serve our customers across Spain.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman of the ONO Board of Directors Jose\u0301 Mari\u0301a Castellano Ri\u0301os said: \u201cThis transaction reflects ONO\u2019s attractive position as Spain\u2019s leading provider of high speed broadband, premium pay-TV and fixed communications. As part of Vodafone, ONO will continue to seize new growth opportunities and deliver the quality that our customers expect. The enlarged business is also expected to drive innovation in the Spanish telecommunications industry.\u201d\n\nThe Transaction enables Vodafone to take advantage of the rapid increase in the adoption of unified communications products and services in the Spanish market and provides Vodafone with immediate access to 7.2 million homes at a significant time-to-market advantage. ONO\u2019s network is complementary to Vodafone\u2019s fibre-to- the-home (\u201cFTTH\u201d) build programme which will be refocused towards areas where ONO has limited or no network presence. Vodafone intends to complete its FTTH rollout to 1.5 million homes passed, providing it with access to a NGN network covering up to 10 million homes released to marketing, equivalent to 57 per cent of total Spanish homes.\n\nIn-market consolidation with substantial cost and capex savings\n\nThe Transaction is expected to generate significant cost and capex savings with an annual run-rate of approximately \u20ac240 million, before integration costs, in the fourth full year post completion, equivalent to a net present value of \u20ac2.0 billion after integration costs. The savings will be primarily derived from utilising ONO\u2019s network for mobile backhaul, limiting Vodafone\u2019s FTTH build plan to the initial 1.5 million homes passed, the rationalisation of overlapping activities and the migration of ONO\u2019s mobile traffic to Vodafone\u2019s network.\n\nSignificant potential to accelerate growth in Spain\n\nVodafone will be able to leverage its extensive distribution network to increase the penetration of ONO\u2019s homes released to marketing, which is currently lower than any other major European cable operator. There is also a significant opportunity to cross-sell ONO\u2019s high quality broadband, fixed telephony and pay-TV offerings to Vodafone\u2019s existing customers. Vodafone also expects to be able to cross-sell its mobile services to Ono\u2019s customers and offer new services, using both companies\u2019 product sets and networks. Vodafone estimates revenue synergies with a total net present value of approximately \u20ac1.0 billion after integration costs.\n\nSignificantly value-accretive transaction\n\nThe Transaction values Ono at a multiple of 7.5x 2013 EBITDA and 10.4x 2013 OpFCF adjusted for cost and capex synergies. The Transaction comfortably meets Vodafone\u2019s M&A criteria and is expected to be accretive to Vodafone\u2019s adjusted EPS and FCF per share after cost and capex and before integration costs from the first full year post completion.\n\nOno management and employees\n\nVodafone values the expertise of ONO\u2019s management team and employees and will work closely with them to support the integration with Vodafone. As in similar recent transactions, Vodafone would expect ONO\u2019s management to become an integral part of the local management team, focused on the broadband, fixed telephony and pay-TV segments of the combined business. ONO\u2019s employees will also benefit from a broader range of international career opportunities available across the Vodafone Group.\n\nFinancing\n\nVodafone will finance the Transaction from its existing cash resources and committed but undrawn bank facilities.\n\nReports emerged Friday March 14 that an agreement had been reached which would see the telco acquire the cable group for \u20ac7.2 billion\n\nThe deal comes soon after ONO\u2019s shareholders had given their approval to an IPO of the company, which now will be dropped.\n\nThe new Vodafone will have a share of 21 per cent in the broadband market, with around 2.4 million users and 26 per cent in mobile with 13.5 million mobile users. The agreement with ONO will allow Vodafone to break into the Spanish TV market once more with around 900,000 pay-TV subscribers from the cable company.","169":"Market players on Monday said that Vodafone\u2019s \u20ac7.2bn acquisition of Spanish cable operator Ono would likely be credit positive for both, and could even lead to rating upgrades for the latter.\n\nSeveral sources said that Ono, rated B1\/B+ by Moody\u2019s and S&P, would likely benefit from greater market access thanks to consolidation in its home market, giving it the chance to even challenge players like Telefonica.\n\n\u201cI think it is very likely that Ono will be upgraded on the back of this,\u201d one London-based investor said, echoing a note published by Fitch back in January that said an acquisition of Ono by Vodafone \u2013 or even Liberty Global \u2013 would skew competition in Ono\u2019s favour.\n\nOthers pointed to Vodafone\u2019s acquisition of Kabel Deutschland in October last year, which saw KD\u2019s ratings upped to Baa2\/BBB+ from Ba2\/BB.

The deal will generate savings of about 2 billion euros and potential revenue addition of 1 billion euros, Newbury, England-based Vodafone said today.\n\nVodafone, which bought Germany\u2019s Kabel Deutschland Holding AG last year, is adding Internet and TV services across Europe as it looks for ways to compensate for falling mobile revenue. The deal may spur more takeovers as rivals try to match Vodafone\u2019s size, said Robin Bienenstock of Sanford C. Bernstein.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the start of a whole new set of M&A stories, pan-European,\u201d the London-based analyst said in an interview. \u201cYou start to see cross-border stuff.\u201d\n\nVodafone shares rose 1.7 percent to close at 226 pence in London, giving it a market value of 59.8 billion pounds ($99 billion). The stock has lost 1 percent in the past year.\n\nVodafone will finance the deal, which preempts a planned initial public offering approved by Ono\u2019s investors last week, with cash and undrawn bank facilities. The 7.2 billion-euro valuation includes 3.3 billion euros of debt. Ono shareholders include private-equity firms Providence Equity Partners, CCMP Capital Advisors LLC, Quadrangle Capital Partners and Thomas H. Lee Partners. The four together hold about 54.4 percent of Ono.\n\nAT&T Interest\n\nEurope\u2019s communications market is consolidating as Vodafone and rivals such as billionaire John Malone\u2019s Liberty Global Plc vie for assets. Liberty agreed to take full control of Dutch broadband provider Ziggo NV for $6.7 billion in January, and last week, French cable carrier Numericable SA won a bid to combine with Vivendi SA\u2019s SFR wireless unit.\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. At the same time, AT&T Inc. remains interested in buying Vodafone even after giving up the option to bid for the carrier for six months, people familiar with the situation said in January. Dallas-based AT&T has expressed interest specifically in Europe\u2019s move into faster, fourth-generation wireless networks, which are a few years behind the services in the U.S. and present the opportunity for carriers to charge a premium.\n\n\u201cVodafone has its own standalone strategy,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Vittorio Colao said today on a conference call. \u201cIf Vodafone becomes a takeover target, we will listen to the stories of whoever has a different view.\u201d\n\nIPO \u2018Music\u2019\n\nTo win Ono, Colao had to convince the company\u2019s private-equity investors that he could offer them a better deal than the IPO, without overpaying. The share sale was expected to fetch 7 billion euros to 8 billion euros, people familiar with the matter have said.\n\n\u201cWhat are the catalysts for a deal? It depends on the music; it takes two to dance,\u201d Colao said. \u201cIn this case, the music was the fact that the IPO was coming. You always need something to trigger a conversation.\u201d\n\nVodafone had raised its offer to about 7 billion euros from about 6 billion euros on March 5, people familiar with the negotiations said.\n\nThe deal must be signed off by regulators, although the companies don\u2019t anticipate antitrust concerns to be an obstacle, Colao said.\n\n\u2018Spending Power\u2019\n\nColao is making purchases while he has the benefit of the $130 billion sale of Vodafone\u2019s stake in Verizon Wireless, much of which was returned to shareholders, and the potential of a takeover by AT&T to keep investors satisfied, Bienenstock said.\n\nU.K. regulators compelled AT&T to clarify its intentions regarding a Vodafone bid after reports that it was considering an offer for the company. In a statement in January, Vodafone said it had no plans to make an offer for Vodafone in the next six months.\n\nColao has said that he has $30 billion to $40 billion in \u201cspending power,\u201d and Vodafone has committed to 19 billion pounds ($32 billion) in network spending in the next two years. Vodafone bought Kabel Deutschland for more than $10 billion and is working on integrating the German cable operator. Globally, Vodafone trails only China Mobile Ltd. in the number of wireless subscribers.\n\nSpain Deals?\n\nThe Spanish deal values Ono at 10.5 times last year\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. When adjusted for savings, the multiple is 7.5, Vodafone said.\n\n\u201cThe price is at the absolute top end of what you can justify,\u201d Bienenstock said.\n\nOno\u2019s sales were 1.6 billion euros in 2013. The company added 9,000 Internet customers and 183,000 mobile subscriptions in the fourth quarter while it lost 17,000 TV customers. Vodafone said the TV loss was due to a poor economy and that it expects subscriptions to recover.\n\nThe Spanish market is showing \u201cpositive signs\u201d as the economy emerges from a recession, Colao said. The investment in Ono will save Vodafone on expansion costs as it builds out a high-speed fiber broadband network with Orange, the company said. Vodafone\u2019s Spanish unit reported a 14 percent decline in service revenue last quarter.\n\nThe purchase of Ono could lead to further deals in Spain. Orange of France has intensified its search for acquisition targets in Spain to avoid being left out of consolidation, people familiar with the matter said last month. France\u2019s biggest carrier is discussing its options with investment banks, with possible targets including Jazztel Plc and TeliaSonera AB\u2019s Yoigo unit, they said at the time.\n\nMorgan Stanley advised Vodafone, and Robertson Robey Associates LLP assisted its board. Deutsche Bank AG was the lead adviser to Ono\u2019s shareholders, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch, UBS AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. worked as co-advisers.","177":"You are using an older browser version.

Zoya Burbeza, a Solicitor at Zaiwalla & Co explains:\n\nToday\u2019s announcement by the EU to impose sanctions on 20 key people in Russia and Crimea, shows it has deemed the Crimean referendum illegal and as such will not endorse the result. The proposed measures include travel bans and asset freezes on those responsible for calling for and organizing Sunday's referendum. It is a strong political statement by European officials who have shown they are determined to punish Russia for its actions in Crimea.\n\nThe travel ban will mean that the individual is unable to travel to any of the 28 member countries of the EU, whilst the asset freeze will result in the suspending of the individual\u2019s legally and beneficially owned assets within the EU. These initiatives are likely to have a great impact on these influential individuals, considering the connections many Russians have with the EU. Many Russian high net worth individuals opt to bank with Austrian and UK institutions and are heavily invested in a number of real estate markets across the Union .\n\nThese restrictive measures are a strong political statement, and demonstrate that the EU is targeting political individuals rather than commercial entities.

Gizem Kara, senior European economist at BNP Paribas, writes:\n\nIn April, inflation should rebound. This will be mainly due to two reasons. First, seasonal price increases will kick in a month later than last year, as highlighted above. This will add around 0.1 percentage point (pp) to annual headline inflation rate according to our forecasts. Second, energy-related base effects should also ease the pace of decline in annual energy price inflation (we expect energy prices to remain flat in April, compared with a 1pc m\/m fall in April last year). This alone will also add another 0.1pp to the headline rate, leaving the annual HICP inflation rate at around 0.8pc.\n\nAfter this volatility in the very short term, we expect a slight moderation in inflation to 0.6pc in Q3, before it rebounds to around 0.9pc by end-2014.\n\n12.55 More from Bruno on those Russia sanctions:\n\n<noframe>Twitter: Bruno Waterfield - <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?src=hash&q=%23Ukraine\" target=\"_blank\">#Ukraine<\/a>: 21 people on EU sanctions list, 13 from Russia, 8 from Crimea, says diplomat<\/noframe>\n\nThe names of the individuals who are subject to sanctions will be published overnight.\n\n12.30 Europe's market watchdog is examining the foreign exchange market following allegations that some of its benchmarks may have been manipulated by banks.\n\nSteven Maijoor, chairman of the European Securities and Markets Authority, which coordinates the application of EU securities rules across the 28-nation bloc, told Reuters:\n\nWe are looking at the sector and we are collecting data, but we have no direct powers regarding any enforcement issues ... it's clearly a national issue when it comes to enforcement.\n\nThe wide-ranging probe has involved several global banks, and there have even been allegations that the Bank of England knew about alleged manipulation, but did nothing.\n\n11.47 More analysis of today's inflation data. Tom Rogers, senior economic adviser at EY, said:\n\nToday\u2019s inflation data illustrate that even the stronger performing economies are now witnessing much slower price growth than is consistent with the ECB\u2019s mandate. We expect the Euro to weaken in the months ahead, as well as a gradual improvement in economic activity, helping nudge inflation back towards 2pc gradually. Nevertheless the slowing of prices in stronger economies gives the ECB more latitude to act, and as such it might be prudent for the ECB to strengthen its policy stance in the coming months as a precaution. A first step might be to be more explicit about what its recent forward guidance means for future interest rates.\n\nMorrisons employee arrested in connection with data theft\n\n11.31 A Morrisons staff member has been arrested following news last week that the salary and bank account details for 100,000 of its employees were stolen and published online.\n\nA disc containing the data was sent to the Telegraph & Argus newspaper in Bradford, where the supermarket is based.\n\nMorrisons said it was continuing to work with West Yorkshire Police on the investigation.\n\n11.20 More on the sanctions from our man in Brussels, Bruno Waterfield:\n\n<noframe>Twitter: Bruno Waterfield - <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?src=hash&q=%23Ukraine\" target=\"_blank\">#Ukraine<\/a> EU sanctions 'long-list' of c130 included Gazprom\/Rosneft CEOs.

As investors prepare themselves for brinkmanship reminiscent of the Cold War there is understandably no sense of urgency as this story will no doubt drag on for quite some time.\n\nThat said, with 6,500 providing fairly decent support for the FTSE 100 while equities look technically oversold as gold sits at six month highs, the brave optimists among us will be looking to grab a bargain or two at current levels.\n\nEuropean leaders to agree sanctions against Russia\n\n11.01 Foreign ministers have gathered this morning for a jaw-jaw on how to punish Russia.

Furthermore, four countries are now reporting deflation (Greece, Cyprus, Portugal and Slovakia) while inflation is only 0.1% in Spain and Ireland. Adding to the ECB\u2019s problems, the euro is worryingly strong, hitting a 30-month high of USD1.396 last week.\n\nThe ECB currently holds the view that deflation risks across the Eurozone are \u201cquite limited\u201d to quote Mario Draghi, but it is concerned that the longer that Eurozone consumer price inflation remains down below 1.0%, the greater the risk of deflation becomes as consumers\u2019 inflation expectations are likely to ratchet downwards.\n\nMario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank (Photo: AP)\n\n10.23 More than a quarter of the eurozone is in deflation, while half the bloc is repo rting current inflation rates of less than 0.5pc, according to official data.\n\nDisinflationary pressures in the eurozone pushed down inflation to 0.7pc in February - matching its lowest ever level.\n\nEurostat revised down its estimate of price rises from a flash estimate of 0.8pc.

The company is up a touch over 1pc, despite suggestions it could damper AT&T's enthusiasm to buy it.\n\nHere's what analysts at Jefferies have to say about it:\n\nThe clear positive from this morning, however, is that Vodafone is addressing a key strategic weakness proactively, delivering on management's commitment to be credible in fibre convergence in key markets on a 5-year view.

Ono is currently serving 1.9 million customers in Spain.]\n\nVodafone Holdings Europe S.L.U. (\u201cVodafone\u201d) announces today that it has agreed to acquire 100% of the share capital of Grupo Corporativo Ono, S.A. (\u201cOno\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) for a total consideration equivalent to \u20ac7.2 billion on a debt and cash free basis (the \u201cTransaction\u201d). Ono has the largest next-generation network (\u201cNGN\u201d) in Spain, with approximately 7.2 million homes released to marketing in 13 of Spain\u2019s 17 regions*, reaching more than 300 municipalities, including the nine largest cities. Ono offers fixed and mobile communications and television services to approximately 1.9 million customers. Principal benefits Highly attractive standalone business Ono is the leading NGN operator in Spain with 7.2 million homes released to marketing (equivalent to 41% of total homes in Spain), providing its customers with broadband speeds in excess of 200 Mbps and the country\u2019s most innovative pay-TV service through TiVo. Ono has invested approximately \u20ac7 billion in its network since 1998. This has been built to a high standard with a consistent design across the entire footprint to deliver high speed broadband and telephony services. The network has a future-proof fibre architecture with 500 homes per node and abundant spare capacity within its 862 MHz spectrum. It has been fully upgraded to DOCSIS 3.0, and further upgrades to network speeds and capacities can be achieved at relatively limited cost as Ono owns circa 96% of ducts in its access network. Significant acceleration of Vodafone\u2019s unified communications strategy in a key European market The Transaction enables Vodafone to take advantage of the rapid increase in the adoption of unified communications products and services in the Spanish market and provides Vodafone with immediate access to 7.2 million homes at a significant time-to-market advantage. Ono\u2019s network is complementary to Vodafone\u2019s fibre-to- the-home (\u201cFTTH\u201d) build programme** which will be refocused towards areas where Ono has limited or no network presence. Vodafone intends to complete its FTTH rollout to 1.5 million homes passed, providing it with access to a NGN network covering up to 10 million homes released to marketing, equivalent to 57% of total Spanish homes. In-market consolidation with substantial cost and capex savings The Transaction is expected to generate significant cost and capex savings with an annual run-rate of approximately \u20ac240 million (\u00a3200 million), before integration costs, in the fourth full year post completion, equivalent to a net present value of \u20ac2.0 billion (\u00a31.7 billion) after integration costs. The savings will be primarily derived from utilising Ono\u2019s network for mobile backhaul, limiting Vodafone\u2019s FTTH build plan to the initial 1.5 million homes passed, the rationalisation of overlapping activities and the migration of Ono\u2019s mobile traffic to Vodafone\u2019s network. Significant potential to accelerate growth in Spain Vodafone will be able to leverage its extensive distribution network to increase the penetration of Ono\u2019s homes released to marketing, which is currently lower than any other major European cable operator. There is also a significant opportunity to cross-sell Ono\u2019s high quality broadband, fixed telephony and pay-TV offerings to Vodafone\u2019s existing customers. Vodafone also expects to be able to cross-sell its mobile services to Ono\u2019s customers and offer new services, using both companies\u2019 product sets and networks. Vodafone estimates revenue synergies with a total net present value of approximately \u20ac1.0 billion (\u00a30.8 billion) after integration costs. Significantly value-accretive transaction The Transaction values Ono at a multiple of 7.5x 2013 EBITDA and 10.4x 2013 OpFCF adjusted for cost and capex synergies***. The Transaction comfortably meets Vodafone's M&A criteria and is expected to be accretive to Vodafone\u2019s adjusted EPS**** and FCF per share after cost and capex and before integration costs from the first full year post completion. Ono management and employees Vodafone values the expertise of Ono\u2019s management team and employees and will work closely with them to support the integration with Vodafone. As in similar recent transactions, Vodafone would expect Ono's management to become an integral part of the local management team, focused on the broadband, fixed telephony and pay-TV segments of the combined business. Ono\u2019s employees will also benefit from a broader range of international career opportunities available across the Vodafone Group.\n\nMore...\n\n\n\nBack to Headlines...\n\n","199":"Vodafone Group has finalized its $10 billion deal to acquire Spanish cable operator Ono.
