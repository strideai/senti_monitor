{"Article":{"0":"WASHINGTON -- Despite a sharp jump in food costs, consumer prices increased just 0.1% last month in an indication inflation remains in check, the Labor Department said Tuesday.\n\nOver the previous year, the consumer price index has risen 1.1%. The figure is well below the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target as central bank policymakers gather for a two-day meeting this week.\n\nFebruary's increase was in line with analyst expectations and matched the previous month's rise. The one-year inflation rate also remained the same as in January.\n\nPHOTOS: Federal Reserve chairs through the years\n\nDriven by the drought in California and elsewhere, food prices surged 0.4% last month, the biggest increase since September 2011. Groceries were up 0.5% in February.\n\nBut the increase was offset by a 0.5% decline in energy prices. A big part of that was a 1.7% drop in gasoline prices.\n\nThe cost of clothes and other apparel also was down 0.3%.\n\nTaking out the often-volatile food and energy costs, prices rose 0.1% in February. For the previous year, that so-called core inflation rate was up 1.6%, the same pace as for the year ending in January.\n\nThe report, along with figures on January housing starts also released Tuesday, were the last major economic data before the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee meets to consider changes to monetary policy.\n\nFed officials are expected to announce Wednesday that the economic recovery remains strong enough to continue reducing the central bank's bond-buying stimulus program.\n\nCritics of the Fed's stimulus efforts have argued the flood of easy money would drive up prices. But inflation has remained in check since the financial crisis.\n\nALSO:\n\nBetty Ford Center ready for a comeback\n\nAmericans are drinking less coffee daily, study says\n\nU.S. lawmakers ask Gilead to justify hepatitis C drug's $84,000 price","1":"cna.not.found.respheadline\n\nThe page you are looking for could not be found.\n\nYou may also like to try the following pages:\n\nAlternatively, you may like to do a search:","2":"\u2018We reacted to something that was clearly not right\u2019: League founder on Trump ban response","3":"Inflation slowed to just 1.1 percent annually in February, according to the Consumer Price Index published Tuesday morning by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nCore inflation, which factors out increases in food and energy prices and is generally less volatile, was higher, at 1.6 percent.\n\nHeadline inflation, at 1.1 percent, was slower than December's 1.5 percent and January's 1.6 percent.\n\nFood prices rose 0.4 percent in February, accounting for more than half of the overall price level rise in February, according to the BLS.\n\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.

By some estimates, food prices at grocery stores could rise 3% or more in 2014 and give a sharp pinch to consumers.\n\nHigher food prices, however, were largely offset by a 0.5% reduction in the cost of energy. Lower gasoline costs more than negated increases in fuel oil and natural gas. High demand for home heating fuels boosted prices during a very cold month.\n\nExcluding food and energy, so-called core consumer prices also rose 0.1% in February. Housing costs, the biggest expense for most consumers, advanced 0.2%. Prices also rose for medical care and airline tickets.\n\nThe core rate is viewed by the Federal Reserve as a more useful gauge of underlying inflationary trends.

Food prices jumped 0.4% in February - the biggest increase since September 2011 - but they are only up 1.4% over the past year. Energy prices fell 0.5% as lower gasoline costs offset increases in fuel oil and natural gas. The core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, also rose 0.1%, driven by another increase in housing expenses. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had expected the overall CPI and core rate to both increase by 0.1%. Consumer prices have risen an unadjusted 1.1% over the past 12 months or by 1.6% on a core basis. Real or inflation-adjusted hourly wages, meanwhile, climbed 0.3% in February to $10.34 .

Users were left wondering whether they will ever get their bitcoins back.\n\nThe rehabilitation procedure is one of several legal actions involving Mt.

Gox\u2019s U.S. subsidiary amid allegations of fraud.\n\nGregory Greene filed the Chicago lawsuit against Mt. Gox on Feb. 27, alleging he lost around $25,000 worth of bitcoins in the exchange\u2019s meltdown.","25":"The page you're seeking is not at this address, but don't lose hope.\n\nPlease double-check the URL or use the site's search function (click on the magnifying glass icon in the menu bar).\n\nIf you clicked on a link, please report the missing page.\n\nThank you.","26":"Bitcoin has not yet closed up shop, but I\u2019m going out on a limb and writing its eulogy anyway. Why now you ask? Because Bitcoin has lost perhaps the most important element of what a credible currency requires \u2013 trust.\n\nCurrencies are used for several reasons and perhaps their most import function is as a medium of exchange to trade goods and services. But where Bitcoin fails most is in another of its core functions \u2013 its ability to be used as a store of value. Investors need a currency to be a safe and secure means to store and protect the value of their wealth. What investors really need with a currency is price stability \u2013 the inverse of volatility. They want its value to remain reasonably constant and perhaps this is where Bitcoin fails the most. Its incredible volatility makes it scare off any sensible investor who understands the simple logic that the price of a Bitcoin can go down just as easily as it goes up.\n\nPerhaps the greatest irony of Bitcoin is that its momentous rise in value may well have caused its very downfall. It rose too much, too quickly. Speculators joined the fun and pushed it to crazy levels. Its rise in value caused volatility, which made Bitcoin vulnerable to significant downside risk.\n\nBitcoin price over the last year\n\nSource: bitcoin charts, www.bitcoincharts.com\n\nBitcoin is the ultimate example of investors suffering from \u201cgreater fool theory\u201d. The theory goes that the price of a tradable asset goes up based on irrational expectations of market participants, and not based on its intrinsic value. The only way \u201cfools\u201d buy such an asset is because they expect to resell it at a higher value to a \u201cgreater fool\u201d. This bubble continues to inflate until such time as the market runs out of fools. When there are no more fools around to buy the asset, the price implodes in spectacular fashion.\n\nThis is not the first such instrument to have been bought in such a speculative manner. The tulip bulb mania and IT dot com bubble are two of the more well known ones, but the history of financial markets is full of speculative bubbles where participants drove the price of assets to exorbitant levels. So the Bitcoin phenomenon is not the first and certainly won\u2019t be the last.\n\nIn certain respects, Bitcoin is really just 21st century gold. But instead of miners working in physical mines, computer hackers work with computers to \u201cmine\u201d for Bitcoins. And the similarities don\u2019t stop there \u2013 the greatest advocates of Bitcoins are the very same people who complain about the US dollar and the American economy. Buy Bitcoins because \u201cthe US dollar is worthless and doomed to failure\u201d they say. It\u2019s a rather strange irony that these people trust an unknown founder with an unknown history more than they do the world\u2019s most powerful nation with a concrete central bank overseeing its money supply.\n\nAnd while the purist ideal of an internet-based monetary instrument \u2013 not backed by the many developed market and over-indebted nations of the world \u2013 is a rather sweet and novel concept, the main reason why I am convinced that it is doomed to failure is because there is no confidence or surety with Bitcoin. For all its weaknesses, the US dollar is backed by the world\u2019s strongest economy and the largest central bank in the world. America is a working, growing economy that produces a quarter of the world\u2019s GDP. It is trustworthy.\n\nThe same cannot be said about Bitcoin. From the sudden closure of the Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, to the evaporation of millions of dollars of Bitcoins, to the attempts to hack its systems and then the recent news of the obscurity of its founder, the trust in Bitcoin has all but dissipated. There is no stability in its price. There is no company or country backing its value. It\u2019s really just a rather speculative bubble that will most likely eventually pop, if it has not already done so.\n\nRoy Topol is an Investment Manager at Investec Wealth & Investment.

But given the size of the bitcoin economy, they are still far, far more common than they have any right to be. A look at the history of bitcoin hacks is a look at the history of bitcoin itself, from its beginnings all the way to the genesis of the professionalised second generation of firms we\u2019re seeing now.\n\nIn the interests of fairness, we haven\u2019t covered the black market. While the disappearance of sites like Sheep and Silk Road took a lot of bitcoins with them, that says more about what happens if you dabble in drug dealing than cryptocurrencies overall.\n\nAllinvain\n\nIt\u2019s not a bitcoin service, but honorary mention has to go to Allinvain, a member of the BitcoinTalk forums who, in June 2011, became the first person to suffer a major loss owing to a bitcoin hack.\n\n25,000 bitcoins were stolen from their wallet after hackers compromised the Windows computer they were using. Even at the time, that sum was worth more than $500,000; it would now be worth a little less than \u00a310m.\n\nMt Gox\n\nThe first MtGox hack came a little after Allinvain\u2019s. The company, which at the time had a near-monopoly on the trade between bitcoins and real money, suffered a catastrophic hack just one week later.\n\nAn attacker with a Hong Kong IP address compromised an account on the site, and then made a massive sale of bitcoins, causing the price of the currency to drop from $32.00 per coin to mere pennies. Ironically, the hackers themselves didn\u2019t even manage to profit from it; their attempts to withdraw the looted money hit up against Mt Gox\u2019s withdrawal limit of $1000 a day.\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop the attack having a catastrophic effect on confidence in the currency. It was 18 months before bitcoin would recover enough to hit the highs it had been at before MtGox\u2019s hack.\n\nBitcoin Savings and Trust\n\nFollowing the collapse of the first bitcoin bubble, hacking activity died down for a bit. With bitcoins worth single-digit dollars, there was less motivation to steal them. But in the summer of 2012, one of the biggest \u2013 in bitcoin terms \u2013 scams ever began to fall apart. And unlike much in the bitcoin world, no hacks were needed, just good old-fashioned fraud.\n\nBitcoin Savings and Trust was a bitcoin-based Ponzi scheme, that posed as a virtual hedge fund promising to pay high rates of interest to investors. In classic pyramid style, only the first people to invest ever saw those rates of return, as the money of later investors was used to pay off early ones.\n\nThe fund was started in November 2011, and by July 2012 users were expressing doubt. But new members carried on joining for another month until August 17th, when Trendon Shavers - the man behind the scheme - announced he was closing it. A year later, the SEC issued a lawsuit against Shavers for running the Ponzi. Over 700,000 bitcoins went through the trust, and Shavers creamed off 150,000 for himself \u2013 returning the rest to investors. But only those who got in there early.\n\nBitcoinica\n\nAt the same time as Bitcoin Savings and Trust was collapsing, a bitcoin exchange was suffering its own legal troubles. Bitcoinica had already been hacked in March 2012, and lost thousands of bitcoins. But the hack wasn\u2019t enough to bring the company down, and Bitcoincia promised that it would pay back users in full. In May that year, the company was hacked again; that time, it was a killing blow. The company closed its website, and promised to refund 50% of customers holdings.\n\nFive months later, that promise still hadn\u2019t been honoured, and four San Franciscan users sued the company for the $460,000 they felt they were owed. It was the second ever US lawsuit involving Bitcoin.\n\nThe Bitcoinica story ended unresolved. The company built its service around MtGox, and so, once it shut down in May 2012, the bitcoins it had left stayed dormant in that account while the legal situation was sorted out. Which meant that when MtGox lost all its bitcoins and closed its doors, the Bitcoinica account holders finally lost everything.\n\nBitFloor\n\nThe summer of 2012 was a bad time for bitcoin exchanges. BitFloor suffered its own break-in in September, losing 24,000 bitcoins when a hacker \u201caccessed an unencrypted backup of wallet keys\u201c.\n\nThe exchange paused operations, with the founder, Roman Shtylman, saying that \u201cI felt it inappropriate to continue operating not having the capability to cover all account balances for BTC at the time.\u201d The company eventually managed to pay most users back, albeit only in dollars.\n\nInputs.io\n\nIf there\u2019s one type of bitcoin business which has a bad name, it\u2019s online wallet services. In theory, they let individual users offload the problems of securing their bitcoins to a trusted third party, while also allowing payments to be made easily and lowering the technical know-how required to get and store the currency.\n\nIn practice, they are the most tempting target for hackers in the entire ecosystem. Since they don\u2019t interact with the traditional banking system to the same degree as bitcoin exchanges, the barrier to entry is far lower, presenting no shortage of potential opportunities.\n\nInputs.io was one such service. In two hacks in late October 2013, the company lost 4,100 bitcoins, worth over $1m at the time. (At current prices they would be worth $2.5m). The site\u2019s founder, known as TradeFortress, announced the hacks \u2013 and subsequent closure of the site \u2013 in a post headlined \u201c:(\u201c. He subsequently recommended against anyone using services like his: \u201cPlease don\u2019t store Bitcoins on an internet connected device, regardless of [if] it is your own or a service\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThat advice leads to its own problems: if users aren\u2019t storing their bitcoins \u2013 or, more accurately, the private key to their bitcoins \u2013 on an internet connected device, spending their money becomes difficult.\n\nBIPS\n\nA few weeks after Inputs.io, another wallet service was hacked. BIPS lost 1,295 bitcoin from its own accounts, as well as money from \u201cseveral\u201d consumer wallets. The company disclosed the theft rather quicker than Inputs.io did, but still waited 11 days from the first hack attempt to finally telling customers that they had lost money.\n\nIn that time, the value of the stolen bitcoins rose from $650,000 to over $1m \u2013 though by the end of December, the third bitcoin bubble had popped, and the value had fallen back down to $690,000.\n\nPicostocks\n\nEven niche bitcoin firms aren\u2019t immune. Picostocks is an attempt to become one of the first bitcoin stock markets. Although it currently has just four companies trading on it \u2013 one of which is Picostocks itself \u2013 that didn\u2019t stop hackers making off with 6000 BTC in late November 2013.\n\nThe company announced the loss on Reddit, and confirmed it would be offline for a week (a \u201c:-(\u201c emoticon ended the message). Impressively, it survived the loss, worth almost $6m at the time and is still trading today.\n\nCointerra\n\nBitcoins are created by \u201cmining\u201d for them, a computationally intensive task which involves deliberately wasting processing power to prove that you aren\u2019t an attacker bent on cheating the network. Cointerra makes hardware specifically for mining: they currently sell a $6000 computer can do the required tasks 6 trillion times a second. That could earn up to $50,000 a month \u2013 but such an investment is speculating, not only on the price of Bitcoin, but also on the number of other people trying to mine for bitcoins. Of course, you have to pay for electricity as well. The box is rated for around 2100W of power \u2013 equivalent to running an electric kettle all day every day. And it puts off that much heat as well, so try not to keep it somewhere too hot.\n\nBut making the hardware which powers the very backbone of bitcoin didn\u2019t stop Cointerra\u2019s email servers from getting hacked in early February. The company takes bitcoin for payments, naturally, but only through a third party company, meaning that its money was never at risk, but the firm had to warn customers to be wary of phishing attempts. \u201cIf you have placed an order and paid via bitcoin since 31 January and have been contacted via email by any person purporting to be a CoinTerra representative offering to discount your order\u2026 please contact us immediately,\u201d the firm warned customers.\n\nMt Gox, part two\n\nOn February 24, MtGox closed its website and announced that it had been hacked, again. This time, it had lost everything: the sum total of its bitcoin holdings were just 2000BTC, according to a leaked crisis document, while it owed customers around 750,000BTC. It was \u00a3284m in the hole.\n\nThe immediate reaction of some was hope. Not for the money lost in the Mt Gox collapse, which represented 7% of all bitcoins in existence (for comparison, 7% of all pound notes is somewhere in the order of \u00a34bn). That seems to be gone forever. Instead, there\u2019s hope that it can signal the beginning of a new age for the currency, one which takes it away from hacking, crime and fly-by-night businesses and towards the professionalism of venture-backed startups like Coinbase and Bitpay, two of the most respected firms in the area.\n\nBut is that hope misplaced?\n\nFlexcoin, Poloniex, Bitcurex & Canadian Bitcoins\n\nThe week after MtGox\u2019s closure two more bitcoin businesses shut their doors after hacking. They even announced the news on the same day. Flexcoin, a bitcoin bank, lost almost 1000 bitcoins in a hacking attack, while bitcoin exchange Poloniex admitted that 12.3% of its reserves had been stolen due to an unbelievable error in coding (the site failed to check whether users had a negative balance, letting them withdraw more bitcoins than they had).\n\nThis week, Bitcurex, a Polish bitcoin exchange, closed its doors temporarily after a hack brought down its Zloty and Euro exchanges. The company lost \u201cbetween 10 and 20%\u201d of funds, according to a statement, but plans to re-open shortly.\n\nAnd just today, Canadian Bitcoins, a Canadian bitcoin exchange, revealed it had lost almost $100,000 in the currency when a fraudster opened a chat session with the exchange\u2019s hosting provider. \u201cHe claimed to have a problem with a server and asked the attendant to reboot it into recovery mode, allowing him to bypass security on the server,\u201d according to the Ottawa Citizen. At no point in the two-hour session was he asked to prove his identity.\n\nIt may be that we\u2019re just seeing the last gasps of the old bitcoin infrastructure, held together with glue and hope by coders who threw it together in a lunch break. But there is little doubt that the history of the currency to date can be told in its hacks.","33":"ALBANY>> As the world wonders what cybercurrency is all about, some small business owners are taking a leap of faith onto the Bitcoin bandwagon.\n\nBitcoin is an online virtual currency that allows people to make one-to-one transactions, buy goods and services and exchange money across borders without involving banks, credit card issuers or other third parties. As a result, this exotic new form of money has become popular with libertarians and tech enthusiasts. Instead of having a checking account, Bitcoin users have a digital wallet on their smart phone.\n\nBitcoin markets itself as the first decentralized digital currency. For small businesses, accepting Bitcoin attracts a niche market, and is a way to get noticed.\n\nPortelli\u2019s Joe N\u2019 Dough Cafe, located at 66 Central Ave., was the first Albany business to accept bitcoin as a form of payment. Owner Alex Portelli started taking bitcoin in February.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPortelli\u2019s best selling item the Stoner Burger, a peanut butter bacon cheddar cheese burger; the burger\u2019s combo costs 0.01276276 Bitcoin, which equals about $8.50.\n\nAt Portelli\u2019s, it\u2019s as simple as scanning the bitcoin address from the menu and sending the money to his digital wallet. Portelli said that every transaction he\u2019s ever made or accepted by cell phone occurred instantly, and the technology is reliable.\n\nPortelli only has a few customers who\u2019ve taken advantage so far, but \u201cThe ones that do, they\u2019re very appreciative of it,\u201d he said.\n\nPortelli thought about accepting Bitcoin as his business expands. In early February, a customer came in with for a large order asking if the cafe would take Bitcoin. The process was kickstarted last month when he attended a Liberty Forum in New Hampshire, where professionals set him up with an account.\n\nAs a business owner, about 15 cents of every dollar is taken out when accepting payment through Visa credit cards, Portelli said. With Bitcoin, however, he gets 100 percent of the money, no taxes paid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not backed up, its unregulated,\u201d Portelli said. \u201cIt\u2019s all done by mutual exchange, and I kind of like that idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all just a matter of what people are willing to accept as a currency,\u201d Portelli said.\n\nDowntown, another new Bitcoin-friendly business opened in Albany this month. Located at 5 Clinton Square, Coffee Time at Hellas Bakery is the second Bitcoin acceptor in the city, and the first international coffee chain to start taking Bitcoin. Hellas is a Greek cafe with locations worldwide, including a future Troy location on 15th Street.\n\nCoffee Time at Hellas Bakery will have their grand opening on March 17. Soon after, they\u2019ll be installing a Bitcoin ATM, the first in the region.\n\nHellas Bakery\u2019s Schenectady location started accepting the currency in January, and were the first upstate vendors to do so. About 8 percent of their sales in 2014 have been made via Bitcoin.\n\nWhen he heard of the new business opportunity, general manager Paul Paterakis said \u201cWhy not? It\u2019s money.\u201d\n\nAt the cafe, Cashiers accept Bitcoin on the store\u2019s tablet. \u201cIt\u2019s as easy as us downloading an app,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\u2019re able to offer an extra currency to our customers, it\u2019s an advantage we have over our competition,\u201d he said.\n\nPaterakis said that their Bitcoin customers are of a young demographic.\n\nOutside the Capital Region, Bitcoin\u2019s popularity has also been growing globally; a world map of all locations which accept Bitcoin is available at coinmap.org.\n\nBitcoin can also be used on popular online shopping site Overstock.com and blogging platform Wordpress, along with others.\n\nWhat worries some is that Bitcoin rates fluctuate quite often. \u201cWe\u2019re in the Wild West of Bitcoin,\u201d said Aaron Benoi, bitcoin user and frequent customer at Portelli\u2019s Joe N\u2019 Dough Cafe. Benoit is a local Bitcoin pioneer who started building his digital wallet in 2011.\n\nBenoit first heard of bitcoin when a single unit was worth about 10 cents a piece. Right now, one bitcoin is worth about $620 dollars, but it can be broken down to several decimal places for small transactions. At its height, a single bitcoin was valued at $1,200.\n\nInvesting in bitcoin is another option. As the price continues to climb, \u201cIf I had put in like $20 back when they were 10 cents apiece I could have paid for my whole college tuition,\u201d College of Saint Rose graduate Benoit said.\n\nHowever, he did make a smart move as he watched the value rise. Benoit ran to the bank and got a $10,000 dollar loan, converted the entire amount into his Bitcoin wallet, and 11 days later it was worth $22,000, he said.\n\nTo cash out, coinbase.com restored his earned Bitcoins to American dollars, buying the forfeited Bitcoins.\n\nOf the 21 million maximum Bitcoins, 12 million are currently in circulation, Portelli said.\n\nSome have yet to be mined. With cryptocurrency, instead of digging gold out of the ground, as it once happened, computers solve complicated algorithms, and the end result is a Bitcoin. Each time one is mined, the algorithm gets more difficult.\n\nOther cybercurrencies are being used throughout the world, including Dogecoin named after popular internet meme dog Doge, and Coinye named after rapper Kanye West.\n\nWhether Bitcoin prevails or another system takes over, \u201cI think cryptocurrency is going to be the currency of the future,\u201d Portelli said. Bitcoin totally renders banks and credit card companies obsolete, he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need them anymore with Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nBenoit agrees, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be the future.\u201d Benoit believes it stems from mistrust in the United States dollar, government, and economy.\n\nHowever, some suspect that these alternative currencies are primarily used for illegal drug bartering purposes.\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts are concerned about the possibility of a federal ban on Bitcoin, as government ponders the feasibility of such action. Some senators, including Charles Schumer, have initiated efforts to limit Bitcoin usage.\n\nPortelli recently invited Congressman Paul Tonko to his restaurant to check Bitcoin out first hand.\n\n\u201cIt massively threatens every government and bank,\u201d Benoit said. \u201cBitcoin\u2019s only going to become more valuable over time.\u201d\n\nBitcoin took a hit early this year when Apple blocked applications for iPhone that allow users to send and receive bitcoin. Users have found other ways to complete transactions. The application is still available on Android smart phones.\n\nAs consumers are growing more curious, very few really have their head wrapped around the idea of cybercurrency and its possibilities. Even the experts are confused. \u201cI am very mystified concerning why this currency has done as well as it has even though I study monetary policy,\u201d said Betty Daniel, professor and chair of the economics department at the University of Albany.\n\n\u201cThere is some reason that I fail to understand regarding why agents think the currency should have value.\u201d Daniel said that she would not recommend using Bitcoin to anyone.\n\nHowever, its usage continues growing, even in upstate New York.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

The anonymous nature of Bitcoin payments has also caught the attention of tax authorities and other regulators, both in Australia and overseas.\n\nOne issue that has received little attention is the GST treatment of Bitcoin transactions that occur within Australia. As discussed below, Bitcoins may not qualify as \"money\" for GST purposes. As a result, some Bitcoin payments or trades conducted within Australia could attract GST (which is not generally the case for transactions involving fiat currency).\n\nThese issues are particularly relevant for GST registered entities that may accept Bitcoin payments. After receiving such payments, an entity will likely either:\n\nuse the Bitcoins to make its own payments for goods and services; or exchange the Bitcoins for another currency.\n\nIf these transactions occur within Australia, a GST liability could potentially arise.\n\nIn a worst case scenario, a GST registered entity that makes a taxable supply in consideration of a Bitcoin payment could be liable for GST twice. Once when the Bitcoins are received as consideration for a taxable supply, and secondly when the Bitcoins are exchanged for Australian currency. This is illustrated through an example in section 8 below.\n\n1 WHAT IS BITCOIN?\n\nBitcoin is a form of virtual (digital) currency. The currency is transferred online, including for the purposes of payment or trade, via a peer-to-peer payment system. Users store their Bitcoins in a \"digital wallet\".\n\nUnlike fiat currency, Bitcoins are not issued by any country. One of the key attractions for some investors is the fact that the value of Bitcoins cannot be controlled through traditional monetary policy.\n\nThe value of Bitcoins has grown spectacularly. In June 2010, a Bitcoin was worth approximately 8 US cents. The value reached parity with the US dollar in the period between February and April 2011. On 29 November 2013, Bitcoins reached a record price of US$1,124.76.\n\n2 IS BITCOIN \"MONEY\" FOR GST PURPOSES?\n\nAs explained above, Bitcoin is a virtual currency which is intended to be an alternative to fiat currency. However, Bitcoins may not qualify as \"money\" as that term is defined in the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (GST Act).\n\nThe term \"money\" is defined in section 195-1 of the GST Act as follows:\n\n\"money includes:\n\ncurrency (whether of Australia or of any other country); and promissory notes and bills of exchange; and any negotiable instrument used or circulated, or intended for use or circulation, as currency (whether of Australia or any other country); postal notes and money orders; and whatever is supplied as payment by way of: credit card or debit card; or crediting or debiting an account; or creation or transfer of a debt.\" (Emphasis added)\n\nThere is a risk that Bitcoins do not meet this definition. In particular, Bitcoins may not qualify as a \"currency\" or \"negotiable instrument\" of the type described in paragraphs (a) and (c). This is on the basis that Bitcoins are not issued by the Australian government, or the government of any other country.\n\nFurther, Bitcoins are not a promissory note or bill of exchange (i.e. a cheque) for the purposes of paragraph (b). Nor are Bitcoins a postal note or money order for the purposes of paragraph (d).\n\nIn relation to paragraph (e) of the definition, the payment of a Bitcoin will not involve a credit or debit card. Nor will it involve the creation or transfer of a debt.\n\nIt could perhaps be argued that a Bitcoin payment will involve the \"crediting or debiting\" of an account for the purposes of paragraph (e)(ii). However, the contrary argument is that such payments will instead involve the transfer of Bitcoins from one \"digital wallet\" to another, rather than the crediting or debiting of accounts.\n\n3 WHY DOES IT MATTER?\n\nGST applies at the rate of 10% to \"taxable supplies\". For these purposes, the term \"supply\" is defined in section 9-10(1) of the GST Act to mean:\n\n\"... any form of supply whatsoever\".\n\nTo ensure that GST does not apply to payments of \"money\", section 9-10(4) of the GST Act provides:\n\n\"However, a supply does not include a supply of money unless the money is provided as consideration for a supply that is a supply of money\".\n\nIn other words, monetary payments are not treated as a \"supply\" for GST purposes, except in the context of foreign exchange transactions. Consequently, because payments of \"money\" are not a \"supply\", GST is not applicable to such payments.\n\nHowever, if a Bitcoin is not \"money\" as defined, the carve out from the definition of \"supply\" in section 9-10(4) may not apply to Bitcoin transactions. This means that, unlike fiat currency transactions, a Bitcoin transaction could potentially be a taxable supply that attracts GST.\n\n4 WHEN COULD GST APPLY TO A BITCOIN PAYMENT OR TRADE?\n\nGenerally speaking, GST only applies to \"taxable supplies\". An entity that supplies a Bitcoin (through either a payment or trade) could potentially make a taxable supply if each of the following requirements is satisfied:\n\nThe supply is made for \"consideration\"; and\n\nThe supply is made in the course or furtherance of an enterprise that the entity carries on; and\n\nThe supply is \"connected with Australia\"; and\n\nThe entity is registered for GST, or required to be so registered.\n\nNote that for these purposes, \"consideration\" can be non-monetary. Therefore, the entity may receive \"consideration\" if a Bitcoin payment is made in exchange for goods, services or other things.\n\nAs one of the requirements is that the entity must make the supply in the course of carrying on its enterprise, a GST liability may not arise for individuals who use Bitcoins as a payment method in a private and domestic capacity.\n\nHowever, if an individual carries on an enterprise that involves trading of Bitcoins then, depending on whether the individual exceeds the GST registration threshold of A$75,000, the individual may need to register for GST and could potentially be liable for GST on the Bitcoin trades.\n\n5 EXAMPLE OF GST APPLYING TO A BITCOIN PAYMENT\n\nWhite Co is a GST registered company based in Australia. It has decided to purchase an apartment in Pyrmont from Rebecca for $550,000. The apartment will be converted to an office and has been acquired as a part of White Co's business enterprise. Rebecca is not GST registered and the apartment she is selling was used as her principal place of residence.\n\nRebecca has agreed that she will accept either $550,000 in Australian currency, or the equivalent value in Bitcoins, in exchange for the apartment. As the supply of the apartment is made by Rebecca in a private capacity, no GST liability will arise for her on the sale (regardless of whether she is paid in Australian currency or Bitcoins).\n\nIf White Co paid for the apartment using Australian currency, which is \"money\" as defined in the GST Act, the payment would not be treated as a supply. Therefore, White Co would not be liable for GST in respect of the payment.\n\nHowever, if White Co instead paid for the apartment using Bitcoins (which may not qualify as \"money\" as defined), White Co may be treated as making a taxable supply of the Bitcoins which triggers a GST liability. The consideration for the supply of the Bitcoins is the $550,000 apartment transferred by Rebecca, triggering a GST liability of $50,000 for White Co.\n\nIn this example, White Co's GST liability would not be offset by any input tax credit (GST credit). White Co would need to have the funds available to the pay the $50,000 liability in Australian dollars.\n\n6 ACCEPTANCE OF BITCOIN PAYMENTS\n\nIf a GST registered entity accepts Bitcoins as payment for a taxable supply, this may give rise to some practical issues that do not arise where Australian currency is accepted in payment. Specifically:\n\nThe entity will need to determine the market value of the Bitcoins that have been received so that it can calculate the amount of GST that is payable on the taxable supply.\n\nIf a \"tax invoice\" is issued, the entity will need to show the amount of GST payable on the taxable supply in Australian dollars on the tax invoice. This is notwithstanding that the total invoice amount may be paid in Bitcoins.\n\nThe entity will need to have Australian dollars available to pay the GST on its taxable supplies. The ATO will not accept Bitcoins as payment.\n\nWhile these issues should generally be manageable, they are additional practical considerations for entities that intended to accept Bitcoin payments. These same issues do not arise for payments that are received in Australian dollars.\n\n7 COULD GST APPLY IF A BITCOIN IS EXCHANGED FOR AUSTRALIAN CURRENCY IN AUSTRALIA?\n\nForeign exchange transactions which occur within Australia are treated as a \"financial supply\". Financial supplies are \"input taxed\" and not subject to GST.\n\nFor these purposes, Item 9 in Regulation 40-9.05(3) of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Regulations 1999 (GST Regulations) provides that a supply will be an input taxed financial supply if it involves an interest in:\n\n\"Australian currency, the currency of a foreign country, or an agreement to buy or sell currency of either kind\".\n\nIt is unlikely that this Regulation could apply to an exchange transaction involving Bitcoins, as a Bitcoin is neither \"Australian currency\" nor \"currency of a foreign country\". Rather, it is a virtual currency that is not associated with any country. Therefore, such transactions could involve taxable supplies, where the requirements outlined in section 4 above are satisfied.\n\nNote that as discussed in section 9 below, GST may not apply if the Bitcoins are supplied to a nonresident counter party that is not in Australia.\n\n8 EXAMPLE OF GST APPLYING TWICE WHERE BITCOINS ARE ACCEPTED AS PAYMENT\n\nWhite Co has sold equipment worth $11,000 (including GST of $1,000) to an Australian customer. White Co has agreed to accept an equivalent amount of Bitcoins instead of Australian currency in payment for the equipment.\n\nWhite Co will have a GST liability of $1,000 on the sale of the equipment, notwithstanding that it has received Bitcoins instead of Australian currency.\n\nFollowing the sale, White Co decides the convert the $11,000 worth of Bitcoins that it has received to Australian currency. White Co sells the Bitcoins to a purchaser within Australia for $11,000. The sale of the Bitcoins may be treated as a taxable supply, triggering a second $1,000 GST liability for White Co.\n\nHad White Co accepted Australian currency at first instance, there would not have been any need to convert the Bitcoins and the second potential GST liability would not have arisen.\n\n9 WOULD GST APPLY IF A BITCOIN IS SUPPLIED TO SOMEONE OUTSIDE OF AUSTRALIA?\n\nIf a Bitcoin is supplied (as either a payment or trade) to an entity that is outside of Australia, that supply may be GST-free (and not subject to GST) under the export exemption provisions in section 38-190(1) of the GST Act.\n\nSection 9-5 of the GST Act provides that where a supply is both GST-free and taxable, the GST-free treatment will prevail.\n\n10 COULD GST APPLY TO BITCOIN ATM SERVICES?\n\nThere have been recent press reports regarding proposals by some companies to introduce Bitcoin ATMs into Australia.\n\nGenerally speaking, ATM services are treated as a financial supply and input taxed under Regulation 40-5.09(4A) of the GST Regulations. However, it is unclear whether those provisions may only apply to ATM services provided in respect of accounts that are maintained in relation to \"money\" (as defined in the GST Act).\n\nIf the provisions do not apply, services provided via Bitcoin ATMs located in Australia could be taxable supplies and subject to GST.\n\n11 CAUTION REQUIRED FOR BITCOIN TRANSACTIONS\n\nFor the reasons outlined above, the GST treatment of Bitcoin transactions that occur within Australia should be considered carefully. This is particularly the case for GST registered businesses that may be considering accepting Bitcoins in payment for goods or services, and for entities that engage in significant Bitcoin trading activities.\n\n\u0160 DLA Piper\n\nThis publication is intended as a general overview and discussion of the subjects dealt with.

We see slower trades,\u201d said Colbert Low, who founded BitcoinMalaysia.com, a local Bitcoin exchange.\n\nEnthusiasts are waiting for the price to stabilise, the next generation of mining hardware, and for new exchanges to open up. There were many projects coming soon to Malaysian shores, Low said.\n\n\u201cOur group is enthusiastic despite the setbacks, but not sure about the general public,\u201d he said.\n\nNook owner Yap: No different from any barter service.Yap, who owns Nook, told The Malay Mail Online that he started accepting Bitcoin in November last year as he was fascinated by how humans put monetary value on lines of computer codes.\n\n\u201cWe get a lot of programmers, freelancers here, and we\u2019ve been talking about Bitcoin for a long time. Of course at that time it was just in my mind, but I\u2019ve always thought it was interesting,\u201d said the former advertising boss.\n\n\u201cIf people are willing to barter services, then isn\u2019t it the same thing as bartering Bitcoins?\u201d\n\nBobby Ong, who runs an online newsletter on digital currency called Altcoin Weekly, said the technology behind Bitcoin solved a number of problems plaguing fiat currency and credit card transactions.\n\nOng said records on the block chain prevented \u201cdouble-spending\u201d. This describes a phenomenon where a digital token can be duplicated and spent more than once.\n\nOnline newsletter publisher Ong: Virtues in Bitcoin, including preventing fraud.Bitcoin can also prevent fraud, as merchants are able to confirm almost instantaneously that a payment has been made, before shipping goods to their customers, the self-taught programmer said.\n\nThere is a gap of 10 minutes between payment and receipt of Bitcoin, during which time the transaction is processed and confirmed using mathematical proof, a process called \u201cmining\u201d.\n\nThe security and anonymity offered by Bitcoin has in turn attracted more vendors in Malaysia to accept Bitcoin as a mode of payment.\n\nA customer can transfer a specified amount of bitcoins from his digital wallet to the vendor\u2019s wallet without any physical exchange.Bitcoin (with a capital \u201cB\u201d) also refers to an open source peer-to-peer system regulating the virtual currency allegedly released by pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, and became operational in 2009.\n\nOne of the earliest vendors was Kuching-based BolehVPN, which offers Virtual Private Network (VPN) services, allowing Internet users worldwide to browse anonymously and securely.\n\nThe instant receipt of money also gave Bitcoin the most traction with online shops, including online marketplace Ked.ai, which started accepting the digital currency in early January.\n\nCrypto Snacks, based in Cyberjaya, meanwhile, offers to deliver snacks in exchange for Bitcoins: one chicken mayo sandwich costs 0.001 BTC.\n\nUnlike normal currencies, the value of one unit of Bitcoin \u2014 1 BTC \u2014 has no intrinsic value, since it is not backed by any physical assets, or guaranteed by a sovereign government or central bank.\n\nInstead, its value depends solely on its acceptance as a currency, and the public\u2019s confidence in Bitcoin.\n\nThe volatility in Bitcoin trade led Bank Negara Malaysia to announce in January that it was not legal tender.It is believed that the first real-world transaction involving Bitcoin was in May 2010, when Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer from Florida, in the US, offered a volunteer from England some Bitcoins in return for ordering two pizzas for him.\n\nHanyecz paid 10,000 BTC for the pizzas, making 1 BTC worth around US$0.0025 at that time.\n\nSince then, the value of BTC reached its all-time high of US$1,250 (RM4,108) in November 2013, before falling to US$421 (RM1,383) after China banned the currency the month after.\n\nThe rise was due to the financial unrest in Europe, including the financial crisis in Cyprus, which started in 2012, causing users to buy up high amounts of Bitcoins.\n\nAt the time of writing, 1 BTC is worth US$621 (RM2,031), according to currency converter site XE.com. Apple banned Bitcoin applications from its devices in early February, a move that dented the virtual currency.\n\nThe currency\u2019s extreme volatility led Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) to announce in January that it was not legal tender in the country.\n\nBNM issued the statement in the wake of warnings by several other central banks worldwide, but stopped short of banning the currency.","48":"Japan yet to decide on Bitcoin rules amid risk of money laundering\n\nStill open for business?

While Bitcoin is not considered a currency in Japan, it could be subject to taxation, as with goods and services, the government said on March 7 in response to earlier questions from Okubo, who is a member of the Democratic Party of Japan.\n\nMt. Gox was a customer of Mizuho Bank Ltd., a unit of Japan\u2019s third-biggest bank by market value. Tokyo-based Mizuho repeatedly asked Mt. Gox to close its accounts in the months before the exchange\u2019s collapse because it was concerned about an unmanageable volume of money transfers, The Wall Street Journal reported this month.\n\nBanks in Japan were required to check the identity of people who wanted to send more than \u00a5100,000 (RM3,230) of cash, along with the purpose of transfers, and keep records of the transactions, the government said in today\u2019s statement.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore said last week that it planned to regulate virtual-currency intermediaries including operators of Bitcoin exchanges and vending machines to deal with risks of potential money laundering and terrorist financing. \u2014 Bloomberg","49":"Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world.","50":"After weeks of showing only legal notices, Mt.Gox\u2019s homepage now has a login screen that lets users check their Bitcoin balances.

It is still unclear when users will be able to access their bitcoins.\n\nIllustration by Bryce Durbin\n\nFeatured Image: Bryce Durbin","51":"No one can easily dismiss the significance of the spectacular bankruptcy of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, once the world\u0092s largest Bitcoin exchange and a company that helped build the virtual currency. Yet Mt. Gox\u0092s half-billion-dollar loss had a remarkably small effect on the global Bitcoin economy. The collapse, for instance, did not seem to shake the Bitcoin faithful. \u0093I think Bitcoin is interesting because it forces people to rethink what money is and how value moves around the world,\u0094 declares Barry Silbert, CEO of New York\u0096based SecondMarket, which is planning to launch a Bitcoin exchange. \u0093In its current iteration as digital currency and as a global transaction network, it has the potential to radically transform our financial system.\u0094\n\nIn many ways, the evolution of Bitcoin continues. For example, Internet retailer Overstock.com reported that after accepting Bitcoin as payment in early January, it had clocked $1 million in sales via the currency by early March; Overstock projected that annual sales could rise to $15 million or more. The number of registered digital wallets at Blockchain.info rose from 1,297,394 on February 25, when Mt. Gox shut down, to 1,370,473 two weeks later, growing at the same rate as before the bankruptcy. Blockchain, based in Skelton, England, publishes online Bitcoin transactions on a real-time basis. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is moving into automated teller machines. Robocoin, a Las Vegas company that operates a network tied to some of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, has placed 14 Bitcoin ATMs around the world, 12 in March alone.\n\nBut the real action in Bitcoin may be taking place in New York. Entrepreneurs ranging from venture capitalists like Marc Andreessen to CEOs like Silbert and high-profile investors like Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are beginning to envision a new generation of Bitcoin businesses that engage the U.S. regulatory system. They share a perspective that involves linking the Bitcoin community with Wall Street and investors \u0097 plugging Bitcoin into the financial system. And they describe a new era of regulation, particularly for Bitcoin as a global payment system, moving away from Bitcoin as a store of value and ultimate currency. Like so much about Bitcoin, their ideas are future-oriented and dizzyingly optimistic, though they also bring a realism to this emerging virtual currency that it hasn\u0092t always had. But is Bitcoin still Bitcoin once it\u0092s left the Wild West?\n\nThe promise of Bitcoin seemed tenuous on February 28, at a packed press conference at Tokyo District Court, where Mt. Gox\u0092s 28-year-old, French-born CEO, Mark Karpel\u00e8s, revealed that 748,408 customer coins and an additional 100,000 owned by the exchange had disappeared as a result of fraudulent activity by unknown parties, made possible by a \u0093weakness in the system.\u0094 The alleged theft represented 7 percent of the 12.4 million coins then in circulation and a loss of $479 million at $565 per Bitcoin, the value on that date. Mt. Gox suffered from a $27 million shortfall, bringing the total loss to $506 million.\n\nThe Mt. Gox disaster triggered a firestorm of reaction and comment. Bitcoin was already controversial. But Mt. Gox stirred up demands from regulators, politicians and policymakers that the Bitcoin community needed to go to far greater lengths to demonstrate it could protect digital financial assets; provide secure, reliable and legal transactions; expand capital reserves; create strong financial institutions; and be capable of withstanding attacks.\n\nToday, as Bitcoin moves beyond Mt. Gox, the tempest has receded. \u0093The failure of Mt. Gox is certainly a significant event relative to Bitcoin,\u0094 says Edmund Moy, a former director of the U.S. Mint who was tasked by the Treasury Department with monitoring the development of the currency from 2009 to 2011. (Moy is currently chief strategist with Morgan Gold, which provides a vehicle for 401[k] and IRA participants to invest in physical gold.) \u0093But it\u0092s not fatal, because the problem was with Mt. Gox and not Bitcoin.\u0094\n\nWhat went wrong? Moy says, \u0093A quirk in Bitcoin\u0092s programming allowed for what is known as transactional malleability.\u0094 This is a technical way of saying a very clever theft. The flaw first appeared in June 2011, when Mt. Gox was hacked and 25,000 or more coins were transferred from individual accounts. Given Bitcoin\u0092s $15 price at the time, this represented at least $375,000. The flaw allowed the criminal to alter a transaction\u0092s term before it was completed, first creating a delay, then allowing the hacker to change the name of the recipient, according to Moy.\n\nMt. Gox detected the fraudulent duplicate transactions and reimbursed customers whose coins had been stolen. In response to the security flaw at Mt. Gox, other Bitcoin-related companies attacked the problem and worked around it to secure sites. Mt. Gox also tried to address the flaw, but \u0093it\u0092s hard work to change your own software,\u0094 says Moy, and the exchange apparently did not do enough to improve security on individual accounts.\n\nIn February hackers probably devised a way around the various security patches, Moy says. Once the vulnerability was discovered, hackers \u0093stormed and overwhelmed the Mt. Gox system.\u0094\n\nBut in January, even before the attack, Mt. Gox had slowed the rate at which it allowed withdrawals, says Benjamin Isgur, a Bitcoin trader based in the Washington area who blogs on digital currencies at TheBlogChain. Isgur reported the slowdown on January 24. \u0093Until they [Mt. Gox] suddenly become transparent and provide any reasonable explanation and solution for their current withdrawal issues, Mt. Gox is Mt. Vesuvius,\u0094 he wrote a month before the exchange failed. According to an unnamed source in a report in Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun, a massive distribution denial-of-service assault on the trading platform hit on February 7, just as the thefts began, and continued until February 10, crippling systems. Most of the attacks came from the U.S. and Europe, the report said. Mt. Gox suspended withdrawals on February 10.\n\n\u0093There are two ways to look at this \u0097 strategically and tactically,\u0094 says Steven Lord, editor of Modern Money Letter, which reports on alternative currencies. Strategically, the benefits of Bitcoin remain. \u0093Tactically, this has raised the specter of Bitcoin being some huge Wild West that\u0092s completely unregulated,\u0094 he says. The failure, he explains, raises important questions that bear on regulation \u0097 anathema to some in the Bitcoin community. \u0093Whose job is it to make sure no one is stealing currency?\u0094 asks Lord. \u0093The effort to answer that question is now going to become extremely accelerated.\u0094 Two weeks after Mt. Gox failed, Japan indicated that it plans to regulate Bitcoin as a commodity and tax Bitcoin purchases and profits.\n\nBitcoin companies may need to take matters into their own hands and create a self-regulatory regime, says Bart Chilton, a commissioner at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. \u0093The best way to ensure Bitcoin\u0092s future is to come up with some voluntary regulations, at a bare minimum,\u0094 he says. \u0093Based on whether or not those are sufficient, it will become clear the extent to which regulators will become involved.\u0094 Bitcoin companies have collaborated to enhance security and have launched an industry organization called the Bitcoin Foundation.\n\nSelf-regulation may clash with Bitcoin\u0092s decentralized nature, which is rooted in a libertarian and free-market ethos. Austrian School economist Friedrich Hayek supported the idea that state-owned currencies should compete with private currencies. Remarkably, the federal government has taken a hands-off approach, at least so far. In a November 18, 2013, letter to the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, then\u0096Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke wrote that although digital currencies could be used for money laundering and raised oversight issues, \u0093there are also areas where [digital currencies] may hold long-term promise.\u0094 That sentence is credited with sending Bitcoin prices soaring from $575 to $775.\n\nBernanke also noted that the Fed lacks the authority to regulate a virtual currency unless \u0093it is issued by, or cleared or settled through, a banking organization we supervise.\u0094 Bernanke\u0092s stance was recently reiterated by his successor, new Fed chair Janet Yellen. In congressional testimony shortly after Mt. Gox, Yellen indicated that the Fed intends to steer clear of Bitcoin and that she thought Treasury should be the regulator.\n\n\u0093I understand people involved in Bitcoin don\u0092t want the government breathing down their neck,\u0094 says Chilton. \u0093At the same time, governments will get involved if they see potential problems.\u0094\n\nJust over a year ago, Bitcoin got something of a green light in the U.S. when the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), part of Treasury, issued guidance that administrators and exchanges of virtual currencies would have to register with the agency as money services businesses and adhere to related reporting and recordkeeping regulations, just like foreign exchange dealers. Far from threatening Bitcoin, that decision was a catalyst. \u0093I would call that ruling a watershed moment,\u0094 says Gil Luria, chief analyst for financial technology at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. \u0093Before that ruling there was a notion that Bitcoin was so ambitious and so revolutionary that the government would necessarily want to squash it.\u0094\n\nLuria says Treasury may have been motivated by the realization that trying to kill Bitcoin would only drive it overseas, where it would thrive using online access to foreign outlets. \u0093What is much preferable to the government is to have third-party entities like Coinbase, BitPay and others emerge that they can regulate,\u0094 Luria explains.","52":"Following both bankruptcy protection filings, first in Japan , and then in the U.S. , troubled Mt.

Consumers increasingly report they would prefer to pay for goods and services via a credit\/debit card or digital bank account, and a recent Javelin study found that cash is no longer is the dominant exchange in point-of-sale systems (it was surpassed by debit and credit cards). There\u2019s another simple way to think about this: When was the last time you carried cash in your wallet? I know I don\u2019t. How can a company adapt to this change?\n\nDigital Currency\n\nFew topics in the world have garnered as much attention as digital currency (also known as cryptocurrency). The biggest name in this arena is BitCoin, a fully digitized currency that conforms to the laws of supply and demand just like international dollars, pounds, euros and yen. The Wall Street Journal notes that it\u2019s possible to use bitcoin to purchase everything from a pizza delivery to a vacation trip to space. A business that accepts bitcoins can turn around and sell them for USD as soon as they receive them for payment. All that is necessary is to set up a digital checkout that takes this e-currency.\n\nRecommended for You Webcast, February 16th: Build Your Growth Roadmap in a Day\n\nBe care with BitCoin. I\u2019m not sure how the success or failure of these digital currencies are going to play out. Usually there are a few very informed parties (people) that make a lot of money at the beginning, while the rest of us are left wondering about the legitimacy of a new currency. If you want to use a digital currency like BitCoin, make sure you know the in\u2019s and out\u2019s and do your research! That being said, there is still a chance for lucrative outcomes by choosing to participate in new digital currencies, especially if your target market is using them. Start with some market research and if your customers are asking for the ability to pay in BitCoins. give it to them, just make sure you turn it into real cash asap.\n\nPoint of Sale\n\nWhen you no longer need a cash register in order to handle sales, do you still need a cashier? More importantly, do you still need a store? This is the big question that brick-and-mortar businesses need to ask themselves. With the change of pace in consumer purchasing, it\u2019s possible to make your sales processes capable of remote transactions. Services like Intuit even show business owners how they can set up a POS solution on a mobile device, so it\u2019s possible to make a sale away from your office or storefront. With no reason to limit your sales to your four walls, why limit the rest of your business to physical boundaries?\n\nLet\u2019s be real.\n\nIf you have a physical office location because you believe it adds legitimacy to your business, you\u2019re wrong. Save that monthly rent and put it towards a new website redesign because your digital real estate is the only thing that matters these days. There are tools like Free Conference Call, Google + For free video chatting, and Regus if you really need a place to have a meeting.\n\nPaying It Forward\n\nWith the rapid decline of cash in favor of credit cards, it\u2019s fair to ask how much longer credit cards will be around before they, too, turn into dinosaurs. Tech providers suggest it may be sooner than we think. Nokia and BlackBerry have incorporated near-field communications technology (used to capture credit card data) into their smartphones since 2011. With NFC settings on a mobile or tablet (and Apple\u2019s newest generation of iPads), it\u2019s possible to turn a mobile device into a credit card that you can scan at everything from a Starbucks to a Honda dealership to make a payment.\n\nThere\u2019s a downside to mobile integration, however: security. Lookout Labs reports that $30 billion worth of cell phones are stolen, lost, or destroyed per year in the United States alone. Losing $20 in cash represents a one-time hit to your budget; losing your credit card-enabled phone can mean far more.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nConsumers no longer want to deal with cash and change. Many more do not even want to pull a card out of their wallets, preferring to integrate their transactions and their favorite devices. Companies who are not only capable of handling mobile processing, but those who can turn it into a trustworthy transaction, will be better situated to net more sales and higher yields.","57":"Bitcoin Tracker | Week 15\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between pork bellies and bitcoins?

Transactions between two parties are sent and received anonymously through coded messages from one Bitcoin address \u2014 a string of randomly generated numbers \u2014 to another, similar to sending and receiving emails without having name, location or other identifiable data tagged with it. Its close scrutiny comes from the anonymity of transactions and its unregulated market.\n\nEach Bitcoin is \u201cmined\u201d \u2014 a process that involves users confirming transactions in return for Bitcoins \u2014 and generated by a unique code. Once a Bitcoin is mined and in the market, it can be sent between users or purchased, much like stocks and bonds can be traded between individuals.

Speculators comprise a majority of Bitcoin activity, making price volatility one reason to forgo commercial adoption. It\u2019s for this reason, and the appeal of a deregulated and decentralized market away from the prying hands of Uncle Sam, that many believe Bitcoin is a novelty with no real future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of interesting stuff. Is it possible this could take hold over time? Yes,\u201d McGrath said. \u201cFor a business owner, is the effort in expense worth the payoff? It depends on the business you\u2019re in.

Customers who use the payment have come simply because of the novelty and an ability to use the currency after seeing a post the son wrote on Reddit, a popular social news website.\n\n\u201cEven if we don\u2019t do a lot of transactions it\u2019s just good for, you know, visibility and novelty aspects of it,\u201d Acosta said.\n\nAs a student studying game design at the Savannah College of Art and Design, Will Preston uses Bitcoin frequently, buying the occasional pizza with his roommate or buying gift cards he can then use in stores around town such as Target.\n\n\u201cReally I\u2019m in control of my money in the same way if I were carrying cash in my pocket,\u201d Preston said, adding that he liked the advantage of not waiting on holds as he would with a normal bank, though he still banks with a traditional institution.\n\n\u201cIf the market was more stable and more places accepted it, if there wasn\u2019t so much fear and uncertainty surrounding it, the minute it goes mainstream I\u2019m gonna be on top of it,\u201d he said.\n\nFor others it\u2019s a serious investment for both business and personal financial gains, something Shaun Beaudry has begun instilling in his co-workers at Anonymous Tattoo on Bay Street where he is the shop manager.\n\n\u201cIf they save that Bitcoin and don\u2019t convert it into cash right away, it will be worth more and more and more and more as time progresses because Bitcoin is deflationary, not inflationary like all of our fiat now,\u201d he said, though holding a Bitcoin out of circulation, being that it is a currency with a limited supply, will create volatility.\n\nBeaudry purchased four Bitcoins when they were priced at $15 each. Then when coin value reached about $100 each, he convinced friends to invest in the market. The currency can be divided into eight decimal places, making 0.00000001BTC the smallest amount.\n\nBut the market does teeter, though generally upward, which brings into question its stability. So how does one know what they\u2019re paying in Bitcoin is the right price in U.S. Dollars?\n\nIn-app converters on smart devices make the transactions seem flawless.

As an added incentive, the tattoo shop offers discounted hourly rates for anyone who pays with Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe Bitcoin isn\u2019t stable long term,\u201d Beaudry said, \u201cbut within a few hours it\u2019s definitely stable.\u201d\n\nNot only does it make promotional sense for businesses to invest in Bitcoin, but the financial practicality of not having to pay credit card transaction fees makes it almost impossible to say no to the digital currency, Beaudry says.\n\n\u201cWe pay about 3 percent to credit cards, which you take some businesses\u2019 profit margins are 3 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will double your profits by using Bitcoin, instantaneously.\u201d\n\nBeaudry added, \u201cI don\u2019t think Bitcoin is going anywhere. I used to be very skeptical of it because I didn\u2019t understand it. Now that I understand it, I realize it\u2019s not only going to revolutionize how we transfer money to each other, but even the network will change how we transfer stocks, houses.\u201d\n\nThe Acostas agreed, likening Bitcoins and the fear surrounding them to the adoption of cellphones and credit cards. At first they were scarce. Now it is unlikely to find someone without either.\n\nWhat\u2019s most telling is the first Bitcoin transaction made at Anonymous Tattoo in mid-January to a customer who wanted ink of just that \u2014 the Bitcoin logo.","59":"2.8K\n\nBanking Bank Of America Goes Employee-Free At Some Branch Locations","60":"Is the Bitcoin revolution just one more doomed universal currency idea? Judging by the recent spate of thefts, frauds and swindles connected to Bitcoin exchanges, the answer seems to be yes.\n\nIf you got in at $30 US three years ago and hung on past the 2013 $1,250 US peak to today\u2019s price at around $650 US, you\u2019ve still done nicely.

He says there would need to be a fundamental problem with gold that an encrypted currency improves on. \u201cGold is not failing as a store of value as wood failed as a source of energy in steam engines. Steam locomotives could go farther and faster on coal. But Bitcoin does not improve upon gold.\u201d\n\nPosner disagreed. In fact there is the obvious difference. Comparing Bitcoin with gold he said, \u201cThe difference, of course, is that it is digital rather than a heavy, unwieldy object. That means that it could serve the same purposes as gold in terms of a currency, but much more efficiently because it does not have any mass and can be sent easily from place to place.\u201d\n\nFred Ehrsam, a co-founder of Coinbase, is betting on a bright future for Bitcoin. Coinbase is a platform that the average person can use to interface with Bitcoin exchanges. He likened it to the first browser to surf the net. Coinbase makes 1 percent when you convert into or out of Bitcoin. \u201cThere are many consumer products one could imagine if this truly starts to replace financial piping, as well as lending, so a fee-based model is not necessarily the end plan, but it works well for now.\u201d\n\nIs 1 percent a lot? PayPal charges 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction. The $.30 is how it prevents micro-transactions. For example, if I buy a Pepsi at an art show with PayPal, the merchant has to tack on $.30 to stay even, or he eats it. Without transaction fees, people can exchange Bitcoins just like it was cash and only pay a fee when converting in or out of Bitcoin. And like cash, the transaction is anonymous.\n\nBut is it really anonymous? Posner says it\u2019s not. \u201cIt turns out that Bitcoin is not purely anonymous, only pseudonymous, so it is not really very good for criminals! Other crypto currencies might be more purely anonymous.\u201d\n\nAnd that is already starting to happen. Bitcoin is the template for other encrypted currencies that it sired, more than 100 now. And according to InformationWeek, \u201c\u2026the prevailing attitude on some leading Russian cybercrime forums, which have ditched well-known virtual currencies \u2014 including Perfect Money and Bitcoin \u2014 in favor of forum-specific alternatives, which administrators claim offer higher levels of anonymity, security and reliability.\n\nForum specific currencies would be a nightmare for Posner because of the sheer amount of fluctuating currencies. He says, \u201cThen we would be stuck with just as much volatility and exchange rate risk at home [U.S.] as we currently have to deal with in transacting abroad. If they act as substitutes, then there really would be no way to control the money supply. If there is no limit to the supply, it would be very difficult for the currencies to maintain their value, and very little reason for people to hold them given that they could easily become worthless.\u201d\n\nAfter reviewing the thoughts and opinions of her interviewees and authors, Goldman Sachs\u2019 Editor of the paper, Allison Nathan, concluded with: \u201cSo where does that leave us? With the conclusion that bitcoin likely can\u2019t work as a currency, but some sense that the ledger-based technology that underlies it could hold promise.\u201d","63":"In a Goldman Sachs report entitled \u201cAll About Bitcoin,\u201d one of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions said that it doesn\u2019t necessarily see bitcoin as a viable, legitimate currency. Instead, it noted that bitcoin will likely become an innovative payments technology.\n\nOne particular claim has generated buzz: bitcoin could save consumers, retail merchants and users of money transfer services approximately $200 billion in the global economy. The figure was hypothetically calculated by the institution. This is an immense sum of money and one that could damage conventional payment service providers, such as PayPal, Visa and MasterCard.\n\nThe biggest hurdles that bitcoin face are remaining alive and maintaining its innovative status, according to Goldman Sachs. The company says more government, greater regulation, increased operating costs and heightened competition are quite inevitable.\n\n\u201cWhile it is too early to tell how banks and payment processors will react to the threat of Bitcoin, we believe that it is only a matter of time before major incumbents develop a digital currency strategy,\u201d wrote Roman Leal, an analyst at Goldman Sachs covering information-technology services, in the report.\n\nAlthough the bitcoin leaders have initiated lobbying efforts in Washington over the past few months, it is still pittance compared to what the credit card and technology industries spend to encourage lawmakers to veer their way on certain pieces of legislation.\n\nCould the $200 billion in savings spell doom for bitcoin? It\u2019s certainly difficult to conclude if the digital currency can defeat efforts to eliminate bitcoin from the economic sphere. Companies like Visa and PayPal have a lot of pull and influence and though it\u2019s unlikely that there will be an outright ban at first, these private enterprises could establish small blockades one step at a time.\n\n\u201cToday the future of the bitcoin is unclear due to the pressure coming from various governments,\u201d said Vladimir Ulyanov, the head of the analytical center of the Zecurion Company. \u201cIf in the past the interest towards the bitcoin was growing by the day, today when governments take steps against this system, the prospects of its development and proliferation are a lot weaker.\u201d\n\nOpponents who have been wary of the virtual currency since the beginning have often warned about these very concerns, especially over the past year. Since bitcoin threatens the establishment then the arms of government could very well protect their contributors.\n\nIt has become apparent that financial institutions are afraid of bitcoin or any other alternative currency. We reported last month that the Bank of Montreal began shutting down business accounts that were associated with bitcoins. Of course, central banks and other financial entities have issued reports highlighting the risks, volatility and security vulnerabilities of bitcoins as well as spelling out its demise.\n\nWarren Buffett, a friend of big government and the status quo, recently came out (a few times) against bitcoin. He urged investors to \u201cstay away\u201d because it\u2019s a \u201cmirage.\u201d","64":"Last week was a horrible week for Bitcoin: as \u201ctransaction malleability\u201d (in effect, a form of distributed denial of service attack) entered the lexicon, $2.7 million of Bitcoins were stolen from Silk Road 2, Russia banned it and the App Store followed suit, the value of a single Bitcoin fell to roughly half \u2013 as against USD \u2013 as it was 14 days ago.\n\nOne could be forgiven for thinking it is \u201call over\u201d for cryptocurrency; the sector is more than just Bitcoin, however, and as a whole the market tells a very different story. Slowly but surely, the one-trick crypto pony is becoming a multilateral ecosystem and one of the more interesting of these developments was the establishment of Ethereum, a project to build a platform to run smart contract protocols.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is a smart contract?\u201d You ask.\n\nIf Bitcoin is cryptography\u2019s answer to payment systems, smart contracts are cryptography\u2019s answer to commerce. Traditional contract law \u2013 the process of negotiating, creating, and enforcing agreements \u2013 is a complex body of rules, with something as straightforward as purchasing a cup of coffee involving a number of legal fictions which a court, on later review, can invoke to determine how an alleged breach of this notional agreement (much of which is implied by law rather than stated expressly, particularly in a consumer context) should be remedied, if at all, to do justice between the parties.\n\nFrom a libertarian perspective, this system has a number of downsides, chief among them in that it empowers the state to interfere with the content of private contracts on the basis of, e.g., public policy (implied terms of employment, other statutory interference with the freedom to contract), taxation (VAT, stamp duty), or welfare objectives (planning gain) which limit individual liberty and interfere with price rationality.\n\nOne of the most popular proposed alternatives to the status quo is David Friedman\u2019s, who proposed abolishing the courts entirely in favour of a system of private enforcement based on private arbitration agencies (in effect, gargantuan legal conglomerates) and a universal reputational rating and disclosure system akin to today\u2019s credit rating agencies. In either Friedman\u2019s case or that of the status quo, however, a \u201ctrusted third party\u201d \u2013 be it a court or an agency \u2013 is required to administer the system, the problem Bitcoin was designed to solve. And just like Bitcoin is designed to remove trusted third parties from payment systems, Nick Szabo, the American legal and economic philosopher, wrote in 1997 that smart contracts would eliminate the trust problem from commercial agreements, too: in a world dominated by \u201cinstitutions of written literacy,\u201d he said, \u201cwe take for granted that contracts and law are written on this static medium, to be interpreted and enforced by human authorities.\u201d But where smart contracts will pose a threat to financial intermediaries such as banks, they will also threaten the reach of those authorities to which those intermediaries customarily submit \u2013 regulators and the courts.\n\nWhere the programmer would say that the blockchain has removed the need for a trusted third party, the lawyer counters that the blockchain is the trusted third party, quite unlike any that has come before it. It is an automaton, carrying out very sophisticated functions, lacking personhood, located nowhere, owning nothing, making no representations or promises. It is more akin to a force of nature, like the weather, than the human institutions it was built to replace. It thus defies easy classification and raises more difficult questions than the manifestly obvious points about money laundering and terrorist financing which are currently in general circulation.\n\nSay, for example, a miner finds a block but, through no fault of his own, winds up on the wrong fork. He has carried out a series of acts which, under English contract law, might otherwise constitute satisfactory performance of a unilateral contract, entitling him to the reward in full. His coins, however, are rendered worthless when the rest of the network abandons him by consensus; what recourse should he have? Who should he sue \u2013 the blockchain? Class-action against the network? What if a court awards specific performance \u2013 awarding the claimant coins on the correct fork \u2013 only to find that specific performance is mathematically impossible for the state to coerce? Would it find all of the users of the cryptocurrency in question jointly and severally liable to reimburse the claimant for the loss, or would it say that the caveat emptor principle applied \u2013 and the unfortunate miner implicitly consented to the possibility that the network might leave him behind?\n\nExamining these transactions at a still more granular level, are units of cryptocurrency even property to begin with? A Bitcoin is not specie (a banknote), nor is it an amount credited to an account (which is not money, but a contractual obligation owed by a financial institution to a depositor pursuant to contract) \u2013 the blockchain, we will recall, lacks capacity to contract. A balance associated with a particular address is not a financial instrument or entitlement in itself, such as a cheque or promissory note; it is merely a history, evidencing that the transaction, and the provision of the relevant private key, has validly taken place in respect of it.\n\nFor broadly similar reasons, it strikes me that \u201cprivate keys\u201d which a blockchain generates also defy normal proprietary classification (see Oxford v Moss and the discussion in Palmer & McKendrick (1998)) \u2013 if you steal a piece of paper with a private key on it, that is theft, but what happens if you find a piece of paper with a private key, take a photograph of it, and access that wallet on your own?**\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that property \u2013 enforceable promises \u2013 cannot exist in respect of, or be denominated in Bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency, or that cryptocurrency isn\u2019t actually property: quite clearly they can and quite clearly it is (even if the law doesn\u2019t yet recognize it as such). What I mean to say is that cryptocurrency, in solving the problem of the trusted third party, presents a more fundamental challenge to the logic of the established order than we once supposed \u2013 and this is only Bitcoin we\u2019re talking about, to say nothing of the autonomous distributed corporations which are quickly approaching realisation.\n\nWhat exactly will happen as the real world and cryptocommerce begin to get acquainted, no one can say. But I am sure of this: it will be a lot of fun to watch.\n\n**N.B. \u2013 In the United States, insolvency filings made last week relating to a Bitcoin mining firm illustrate beautifully some of the teething problems to which cryptocurrency litigation will give rise.

Or, more likely, it's already there.\n\nThe five-year-old digital currency is increasingly being adopted by brick-and mortar businesses, including dentists, pet boutiques -- even a small honey business in Utah.\n\nIn 2012, about 1,000 businesses used BitPay, the largest processor of Bitcoin payments. Today, more than 26,000 businesses worldwide use BitPay, said Tony Gallippi, its cofounder and CEO.\n\nThe majority of those firms are small businesses -- about half are in the U.S. and the rest are international. And while a majority are online sellers, Gallippi said 20% are merchants with storefronts.\n\nMost prominent in tech hubs like San Francisco, New York and Atlanta, the shops range from bakeries and wine stores to car dealers and mattress sellers.\n\nBitPay estimates that there are currently about 5 million active digital wallets, or Bitcoin accounts, worldwide. But the currency has had its fair share of negative headlines lately for the volatile price, underground drug market busts, high-profile hacks and calls for regulation.\n\n\"There's no government agency that's backing Bitcoin,\" said Jeffery Born, a finance professor at Northeastern University.\n\nRelated: What is Bitcoin\n\nBut these risks aren't deterring small businesses from embracing the virtual currency.\n\nCraig Huntzinger started Bees Brothers in 2008 as a booth at a farmer's market in Cache Valley, Utah. Over the years, he added a line of honey-flavored caramels and launched an online store. In January 2012, Huntzinger started accepting Bitcoin for online purchases, which he promoted on a Bitcoin forum.\n\n\"Initially I was fascinated by this idea of decentralized money and wanted to support it,\" said Huntzinger. Then he started to appreciate some of its other benefits.\n\n\"It's fast and it makes it easy to sell to anybody in the world,\" he said.\n\nIt also cuts down on processing fees. Credit cards usually charge 2% to 3% in fees; BitPay and similar processors charge between 0% and 1%.\n\nToday, about 50% of Bees Brothers transactions -- both wholesale and retail -- are done with Bitcoins. Initially, they came largely from Seattle, New York, L.A. and San Francisco. Now, he said the orders are all over the world.\n\nRelated: Alleged Bitcoin creator denies he's the one\n\nNashville's My Second Home, a high-end pet boarding and grooming business, began accepting Bitcoin in January. Chris Starko, its marketing director, said they felt it would give the business a competitive edge.\n\n\"We want to be seen as a progressive company versus our competitors,\" he said. \"The [Bitcoin payment] process takes only a minute, allowing our customers to quickly pick up their pets and make their way home.\"\n\nIf it takes off, he said it could account for up to 20% of future payments. \"We've had many customers tell us they appreciate it.\"\n\nRelated: 6 most dangerous cyberattacks\n\nBitcoin's marketing potential is a big reason small businesses are trying it out, said Born. \"It's a way to attract new customers.\"\n\nIt's why Dr. Max Kerr, a dentist, started accepting Bitcoin three months ago at his practice outside Austin. Kerr believes it's a novel way to \"put the business on the map,\" especially with Austin's young, tech-savvy population.\n\nHis uses BitPay to process Bitcoin transactions, which offers three options. Users can have Bitcoin payments converted into cash and deposited into their bank account, they can keep the funds as Bitcoins, or they can or opt for a combination of the two.\n\nIf merchants want to keep payments in Bitcoin, which Gallippi said less than 10% do, they need to open a digital wallet through a Bitcoin exchange.\n\nMore than half of BitPay's merchants convert the Bitcoins immediately into cash. That's what Kerr opts for, since it's a way for him to mitigate the risk.\n\n\"In 15 seconds, I'll get an email confirming the deposit,\" he said. \"I just think of it as a cash transaction.\"","66":"An archive containing transaction records from Mt.

Gox database access tool. However, in the background they launch a process -- TibanneSocket.exe on Windows -- that searches for bitcoin.conf and wallet.dat files on the user's computer, according to Lozhkin. \"The latter is a critical data file for a Bitcoin crypto-currency user: if it is kept unencrypted and is stolen, cyber criminals will gain access to all bitcoins the user has in his possession for that specific account.\"\n\nThe malware, which Kaspersky has named Trojan.Win32.CoinStealer.i (the Windows version) and Trojan.OSX.Coinstealer.a (the Mac version), uploads the stolen Bitcoin wallet files to a remote server that used to be located in Bulgaria, but is now offline.\n\n\"It seems that the whole leak was invented to infect computers with Bitcoin-stealer malware that takes advantage of people's keen interest in the Mt. Gox topic,\" Lozhkin said.\n\n\"Malware creators often using social engineering tricks and hot discussion topics to spread malware, and this is great example of an attack on a focused target audience,\" he said.\n\nUsers who downloaded the archive and executed any of the binary files inside should probably scan their computers with an anti-malware program and should take immediate steps to secure their bitcoins.

(Photo: KAREN BLEIER AFP\/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Enrollment in private health insurance plans through the HealthCare.gov marketplace has more than doubled in South Carolina since the start of the year, according to recent federal data.\n\nIn line with national patterns, only one-quarter of those enrollees are between 18 and 34, continuing concerns there won't be enough younger, healthier people in the mix.\n\nAs of March 1, 55,830 people in South Carolina has chosen a plan through the marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act, up from 24,116 at the end of December.\n\nOpen enrollment ends March 31, and administration officials have accelerated advertising to try and boost the numbers in the final weeks.\n\n\"What we're finding is that as more Americans learn just how affordable marketplace insurance can be, more are signing up to get covered,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told reporters last week after the monthly data was released.\n\nThe 2010 Affordable Care Act requires almost everyone to be insured or pay a penalty. The federal HealthCare.gov site and separate, state-based online marketplaces were created for people who don't already get insurance through an employer or a government program like Medicare or Medicaid.\n\nOf the 4.2 million people enrolled nationally so far, 55 percent are women and 53 percent are between 45 and 64. South Carolina's data seems to reflect those age and gender trends: Fifty-eight percent of enrollees in the state are women, and 54 percent are between 45 and 64.\n\nRepublicans say the data should prompt President Barack Obama and Congress to delay the penalty affecting people who choose to remain uninsured.\n\n\"It seems the president's push to enroll young adults is far too little, too late,\" said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio. \"But what we do know is that young adults \u2014those who the White House repeatedly said are critical \u2014 are deciding the health care law is a bad deal.\"\n\nThe HHS figures don't include information on how many enrollees are first-time buyers of health insurance, or how many have started paying their premiums.\n\nOf the 55,830 South Carolina residents who have selected a private insurance plan on HealthCare.gov, 86 percent qualified for some financial assistance in the form of tax credits based on income and family size. Generally, a family of four earning $23,550-$94,200 will qualify for a credit that is applied to the monthly premium.\n\nSouth Carolina is among states that refused to expand the number of people eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, but HealthCare.gov appears to be helping the state find and enroll people who qualify for the existing federal-state insurance program.\n\nSince Oct. 1, the site has referred almost 20,000 people to Medicaid based on family incomes.\n\nThe federal enrollment data released monthly counts insurance sign-ups in states that run their own insurance exchanges and those like South Carolina that opted to rely on the federal HealthCare.gov site.","72":"Enrollment in ACA Exchanges Reaches 5M, Tavenner Says\n\nOn Monday, CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner announced that as of Sunday at least five million people had enrolled in health plans through the Affordable Care Act's federal and state-operated insurance exchanges, the New York Times reports (Pear, New York Times, 3\/18).\n\nAccording to Tavenner, nearly 800,000 people enrolled in coverage during the first two weeks of March, which indicates that enrollment rates are surging in the final days of the open enrollment period that ends on March 31 (Somashekhar, \"Post Politics,\" Washington Post, 3\/17).\n\nLast week, HHS reported that about 940,000 U.S. residents had enrolled in health plans through the exchanges throughout the entire month of February, bring total enrollment in the health insurance marketplaces by the end of February to 4.2 million (California Healthline, 3\/12).\n\nIn an HHS blog post, Tavenner wrote that \"[t]he last several days have been the busiest since December\" 2013 for the exchanges. She noted that a federal exchange hotline number received more than 198,000 calls on Thursday alone. In addition, HealthCare.gov -- the federal health insurance exchange website -- received more than four million visits last week, while another one million people visited the site during the weekend (\"Post Politics,\" Washington Post, 3\/17).\n\nThe two-week enrollment surge brings total exchange enrollment closer to the Congressional Budget Office's February projection that at least six million people will enroll in exchange health plans by the end of March. CBO previously estimated that about seven million people would sign up for coverage through the exchanges, but analysts reduced the figure primarily because of the troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov last fall (Corbett Dooren, Wall Street Journal, 3\/17).\n\nMeanwhile, Tavenner's announcement on Monday still did not include some key data that would provide a clearer picture about actual coverage rates and the success of the exchanges.\n\nFor example, it is not clear:\n\nHow many of the new enrollees are between the ages of 18 to 34, a demographic seen as essential to the law's success;\n\nHow many new enrollees were previously uninsured (Morgan, Reuters, 3\/17); and\n\nHow many of them had paid their first month's premiums (\"Post Politics,\" Washington Post, 3\/17).\n\nSuch data are key in determining how many individuals actually have gained coverage and benefit from the law (California Healthline, 3\/14).","73":"Health insurance exchanges have had mixed success in boosting competition in different insurance markets, according to a new study from the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nAnalyzing data from the seven states that have published their enrollment figures, Kaiser researchers found that some states, such as California and New York, have much more competitive insurance markets than they did before the exchanges opened. But other state markets, including Connecticut and Washington, are actually less competitive than they were a year ago.\n\n\"There are some examples of smaller or newer plans being able to get a sizable piece of the market in the exchanges, but by and large a lot of the players in the exchanges that are the biggest [now] were the biggest before,\" Cynthia Cox, a senior analyst at Kaiser, told Bloomberg.\n\nIn California, for example, Anthem Blue Cross previously held 47 percent of the market for private plans in 2012, which dropped to 30 percent in the state's online marketplace. That's a change from an analysis in January that found insurers in California had largely held onto their market share.\n\nNew York's Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield comprised 28 percent of the market in 2012, but that share has lowered to 18 percent on the exchange this year. And of the 16 insurers selling individual policies on the state exchange, seven have more than a 5 percent market share.\n\nAmong states with less competitive markets, just three insurers are selling plans on Connecticut's exchange. WellPoint dominates the market with a 60 percent share. EmblemHealth has 37 percent of the market and HealthyCT has just 3 percent. And Washington's Premera Blue Cross controls 62 percent of the exchange market, compared with its 40 percent market share in 2012.\n\nBut WellPoint spokeswoman Kristin Binn told Bloomberg that the report isn't representative of all markets and shouldn't lead to widespread conclusions because, for example, the data doesn't include members whose plans were renewed from prior years or new members who signed up without using exchanges.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the Kaiser study\n\n- read the Bloomberg article","74":"A snapshot of Obamacare enrollment in seven states suggests the law hasn\u2019t significantly increased competition in health insurance markets, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported Monday.\n\n\n\nBut it has shuffled market share in several states for some insurers, including Indianapolis-based WellPoint Inc.\n\n\n\nIn California, for example, four big insurers have largely carved up the state\u2019s market. The divide is more equitable than before the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as California\u2019s insurance market is now \u201cmoderately concentrated\u201d instead of \u201chighly concentrated,\u201d according to a measure of market share called the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, said researchers at Kaiser, a Menlo Park, Calif.-based not-for-profit that focuses on health care.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are some examples of smaller or newer plans being able to get a sizable piece of the market in the exchanges, but by and large a lot of the players in the exchanges that are the biggest were the biggest before as well,\u201d Cynthia Cox, a senior analyst at Kaiser, said.\n\n\n\nAbout 5 million Americans had signed up for private health plans through Monday using the law\u2019s insurance exchanges, according to the U.S. government. The exchanges were intended to ease access and improve transparency for people who shop for insurance on their own, about 5 percent of the U.S. population. Democrats who wrote the law also hoped to break the dominance of some companies that existed in many states.\n\n\n\nIn California, WellPoint\u2019s Anthem brand signed up about 30 percent of the 869,000 people who used the state\u2019s health exchange, Covered California, by March 1. Anthem had 47 percent of the state\u2019s market before plans started to be sold on the new health exchanges on Oct. 1.\n\n\n\nState changes\n\n\n\nWellPoint also lost market share in New York and Nevada, where it fell from 28 percent and 34 percent of the market, respectively, to 18 percent and 12 percent, Kaiser said in its report. In Connecticut, WellPoint\u2019s plans now hold 60 percent of the market from 45 percent before major provisions of the law known as Obamacare took effect.\n\n\n\nKristin Binns, a WellPoint spokeswoman, cautioned against drawing conclusions from the Kaiser data, which exclude customers whose plans were renewed from prior years and people who signed up without using exchanges.\n\n\n\nBefore the health-care law, one insurance company held at least half the individual market in 30 states, according to the Kaiser report. That remains true in some states, even after the major provisions of Obamacare took effect this year. In Minnesota, for example, PreferredOne, a closely held company based in Golden Valley, Minn., has taken about 59 percent of customers on the state\u2019s exchange, MNsure.\n\n\n\nEnrolling customers\n\n\n\nBefore the health law, the state\u2019s Blue Cross Blue Shield plan had 59 percent of the market, while PreferredOne had 3 percent. Blue Cross Blue Shield now has 24 percent share.\n\n\n\nThe Kaiser report said that PreferredOne took share by offering \u201csome of the lowest exchange premiums in the country\u201d for plans with very narrow networks of hospitals and doctors.\n\n\n\nAbout 95 percent of Americans have a choice of two or more insurance carriers in their state exchanges, Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services said in an e-mail. The government said in September that about 25 percent of companies offering plans on the exchanges were new to the individual market.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll consumers shopping in the marketplaces also have greater transparency where they can compare comprehensive, affordable plans side by side to find the one that best meets their needs,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nOpen enrollment for exchange plans closes for 2014 on March 31.","75":"Thank you for subscribing to newsletters from Nextgov.com.\n\nWe think these reports might interest you:\n\nIt\u2019s Time for the Federal Government to Embrace Wireless and Mobility The United States has turned a corner on the adoption of mobile phones, tablets and other smart devices, outpacing traditional desktop and laptop sales by a wide margin.

After March 31, Connecticut residents won\u2019t be able to buy individual-market health plans for this year, unless they go through a change in circumstances like losing a job or getting divorced (and no, getting sick doesn\u2019t count).\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the deadline, how you can qualify for a special enrollment period if something changes and you need coverage after March 31, the penalty for not having insurance and how to get an exemption from the individual mandate.\n\nIf you have a question about Obamacare, email Mirror health reporter Arielle Levin Becker at alevinbecker@ctmirror.org.\n\nWhat is the March 31 deadline for?\n\n\n\nMarch 31 is the last day to buy individual-market private insurance in Connecticut for 2014. That applies to health plans sold by the health exchange and those sold outside the exchange.\n\n(Because of inaccurate information provided by the companies, last week\u2019s Q&A incorrectly said that at least one company would continue selling insurance to individuals after March 31. In fact, none will, unless you have a change in circumstances that qualifies you to buy insurance outside the open enrollment period.)\n\nBut the deadline does not apply to small-group insurance plans. It also doesn\u2019t apply to people who qualify for Medicaid, who can sign up at any time during the year.\n\nWhat if I lose my job after March 31? Would I be unable to buy insurance?\n\nNo, you would be able to buy insurance because losing your job is considered a \u201cqualifying life event\u201d that allows you to sign up for insurance even if the open enrollment period for the year has ended. Other qualifying events include getting married or divorced, having a baby, moving to another state or, in some cases, changes in income.\n\nPeople who have a qualifying event and want to buy insurance can request a \u201cspecial enrollment period\u201d to sign up for coverage. That would give them 60 days from the date of the qualifying event to buy insurance.\n\nHow do you get a special enrollment period to sign up for coverage after March 31?\n\nThe easiest way for people who want to buy coverage through the exchange to request a special enrollment period is to use the Access Health call center (1-855-805-4325), said Chad Brooker, policy and legal analyst at Access Health.\n\nYou will probably be asked to submit documentation to prove why you qualify for the enrollment exception, such as a letter confirming that your job no longer provides health care or a letter saying you no longer qualify for Medicaid.\n\nPeople will also still be able to browse health plans through the exchange\u2019s website after March 31, Brooker said.\n\nPeople who qualify for special enrollment periods can also purchase insurance sold outside the exchange.\n\nI\u2019m working on my tax returns now. Do I need to do anything to prove that I have insurance?\n\nNo. The individual mandate didn\u2019t take effect until this year so your taxes for 2013 are not affected.\n\nI\u2019m thinking of not getting insurance and paying the penalty. What do I need to know?\n\nThe penalty for 2014 is 1 percent of your income above the tax return threshold or $95, whichever is higher. (For most people, it will be 1 percent.) The penalty will increase in subsequent years.\n\nIf you have coverage for part of the year, you\u2019ll owe a prorated penalty. It\u2019s calculated based on the number of months you didn\u2019t have coverage, with each month costing you 1\/12 of the full-year penalty. So if you\u2019re uninsured for six months, you\u2019d owe half of 1 percent of your income.\n\nIf you\u2019re uninsured for fewer than three consecutive months, you won\u2019t have to pay a penalty.\n\nAnother thing to note: According to federal regulations, if you have insurance for at least one day in a given month, you are considered to be insured for that full month and wouldn\u2019t owe a penalty for that month.\n\nWhat happens if you don\u2019t pay your penalty? The federal government can\u2019t issue a lien, but it can deduct the amount from any refund you\u2019re owed, according to the IRS.\n\nI think I\u2019m exempt from the individual mandate. How do I get out of paying the penalty for not having insurance?\n\nIn most cases, you\u2019ll have to apply for an exemption through Connecticut\u2019s exchange. (Brooker said Connecticut is the only state handling its own exemption process. The other states are relying on the federal government to do it.)\n\nTo apply for an exemption, you\u2019ll have to fill out this form. (You can find it on the Access Health website, www.accesshealth.com, by clicking the \u201cCan I opt out?\u201d tab on the bottom right corner of the homepage.)\n\nA team at the exchange will review the submitted forms and any supporting documents people include and determine if they meet the requirements for an exemption. For those who qualify, the team will also determine whether they will be granted an exemption for the full year or for part of the year.\n\nOne group that doesn\u2019t need to apply for an exemption: People who don\u2019t have enough income to be required to file a federal income tax return. The Internal Revenue Service has said people in that category, who are not subject to the individual mandate, don\u2019t have to take any action to get an exemption.\n\nThere are several circumstances in which someone could be exempt from the individual mandate. They are:\n\nIf you\u2019re uninsured for fewer than three months of the year;\n\nIf coverage is unaffordable to you \u2014 that is, if the cheapest option available would cost more than 8 percent of your household income;\n\nIf your income is too low for you to be required to file a tax return (in Connecticut, many people in this category would qualify for Medicaid);\n\nBelonging to a federally recognized tribe;\n\nBeing a member of a recognized health care sharing ministry;\n\nBeing a member of a recognized religious sect with religious objections to insurance, including Social Security and Medicare;\n\nIf you\u2019re incarcerated;\n\nIf you\u2019re not in the country legally.\n\nIn addition, people could potentially qualify for a \u201chardship exemption\u201d from the mandate if any of the following affected their ability to buy health insurance:","80":"Sorry, the page you're looking for cannot be found.\n\nThe page may have moved, you may have mistyped the address, or followed a bad link.\n\nVisit our homepage, or search for whatever you were looking for\u2026","81":"We're sorry!

The massive reorganization of the health-care sector presumed that 40 million (or 48 million, or 37 million) people lacked insurance all for the same reason \u2014 obstacles such as pre-existing conditions or economic hardship. A great many of those were either transitionally uninsured or uninsured by choice. Not surprisingly, a new survey shows that a significant number still don\u2019t want to pay for health insurance, mandates notwithstanding:\n\nA new report finds that one in three Americans who do not have health insurance plan to remain uninsured. According to the survey done by Bankrate.com, of the 34 percent who say they won\u2019t purchase Obamacare, 41 percent said it was too expensive, 17 percent were against the Affordable Care Act and 13 percent said they were healthy enough not to need coverage. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to generalize, but for some of these folks, it\u2019s a case of, \u2018I\u2019m in pretty good health, I don\u2019t think about these things, I know I can\u2019t afford it now,\u2019\u201d Michael Morrisey, professor of health economics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Public Health, told Bankrate.com. \u201cI think it\u2019s just rolling past them, and they\u2019re not giving it a whole lot of attention.\u201d Only 56 percent polled said they plan to purchase health insurance.\n\nThe article then quotes a researcher who thinks that the problem is that the White House didn\u2019t emphasize the penalties hard enough. Well, it\u2019s difficult to emphasize penalties when those keep getting delayed, especially by the same White House that would need to do the emphasizing. The penalty for the individual mandate is all but gone for tax years 2014 and 2015, thanks to the latest unilateral change coming from the Obama administration. Penalties that don\u2019t penalize aren\u2019t really all that motivating.\n\nBesides, the survey itself makes it pretty clear that the refuseniks in this case aren\u2019t making that decision out of sloth. More than 40% of them think ObamaCare is too expensive, and another 13% don\u2019t see the need for comprehensive insurance, which is a majority who see the mandate as so cost-ineffective that it\u2019s worth it to pay the penalty instead. Those are rational decisions, which a significant portion of the uninsured population made prior to ObamaCare, too.\n\nHow rational? Paul Bedard reports that an eHealthInsurance survey shows it to be a wise calculation (via Power Line):\n\nAccording to a cost report from eHealthInsurance, a nationwide online private insurance exchange, families are paying an average of $663 a month and singles $274 a month, far more than before Obamacare kicked in. What\u2019s more, to save money, most buyers are choosing the lowest level of coverage, the so-called \u201cbronze\u201d plans. The firm provided the costs to Secrets through their new online price index, which gives the averages of what people are paying for insurance sold through their system. In California, for example, some families are paying a high of $2,604 a month and in New York, $1,845. \u2026 \u2014 Premiums have increased by 39 percent to 56 percent, compared to pre-Obamacare coverage. As of Feb. 24, the average premium for an individual health plan selected through eHealth without a subsidy was $274 per month, a 39 percent increase over the average individual premium for pre-Obamacare coverage.\n\n\u2014 The most recent average premium for plans without a subsidy chosen by families was $663 per month, a 56 percent increase over the average family premium in Feb. 2013, which was $426 per month.\n\nThis follows on sharp premium increases since the 2010 passage of ObamaCare, too, after the taxes and mandates for coverage began to kick in for insurers. Families are now spending almost $8,000 for an average policy, and that\u2019s before the deductibles. They will have to spend thousands of dollars more before their benefits actually take effect. The same is true for individuals; at the above average, it\u2019s about $3300 for premiums and thousands more in deductibles. So much for \u201cbending the cost curve downward.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s remember that this market disruption was ostensibly created to entice all of these uninsured into the system. What rational reason do these costs give them to comply? It\u2019s better to pay the fine and deal with routine care with out-of-pocket payments, then get insured late if a catastrophic event takes place.\n\nMaybe, when we finally scrap this system, we\u2019ll design one that offers real cost savings through open competition and reduced government rationing. In the meantime, no one can blame people for making rational choices, except of course this White House.\n\nRelated Posts:","86":"One in three Americans who lack health coverage plan to remain uninsured, citing cost as their chief obstacle, according to Bankrate's latest Health Insurance Pulse survey.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nFewer than a third (30%) of the uninsured realize that federal tax credits available through the new Obamacare health exchanges can make health insurance affordable to lower-income individuals and families.\n\nIn a telephone survey of uninsured adults drawn from a nationally representative sample of more than 3,000 Americans, one-third (34%) said they intend to continue without health coverage.

They're probably not spending a lot of time watching television, they never read a newspaper, and if they listen to radio, it's probably music in the car,\" she says.\n\n\"In communities of color, people might hear about (Obamacare) in church, but for people who are not attached to a church, I don't know how they get the information.\"\n\nToo much carrot, not enough stick\n\nOutreach efforts that emphasize Obamacare's positive tax subsidies rather than the punitive tax penalty for not having insurance may have failed to prompt action, says Sabrina Corlette, research professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute.\n\n\"They found in Massachusetts, with \"RomneyCare,\" that the individual mandate penalty absolutely motivated a lot of people to purchase insurance,\" she says. \"The Obama administration understandably tried to emphasize the positive, but people need to understand that the mandate is not insignificant -- they could be hit with a big tax bill if they don't buy coverage.\"\n\nBut Morrisey says the more favorable message about the subsidies may have fallen flat with the uninsured as well.\n\n\"Someone who makes so little money that they haven't had to file taxes in the past might say, 'How is a tax credit going to help me? I don't even think about tax things because I don't have to file,'\" he says.\n\nMany are in the dark about the deadline\n\nAlso in the survey, fewer than half (48%) of the uninsured could correctly name March 31 as the deadline for obtaining health insurance to avoid the penalty.\n\n\"What people need to understand is that the door really closes on March 31,\" Corlette cautions. \"It they don't sign up before then, they're out of luck until Nov. 15 unless they have one of the special enrollment situations, which happen if you lose your job or get a divorce.\"\n\nBetween now and March 31, \"the administration needs to really amp up those marketing and outreach campaigns and meet people where they're at,\" she says. \"It's got to be all about marketing and outreach now.\"\n\nRole of states' Medicaid decisions?\n\nOne big unknown in the survey results is how many of the uninsured who plan to stay that way might qualify for Medicaid -- except that their state has chosen not to expand the program.\n\n\"If you're in one of the 24 states that did not expand their Medicaid program and you have income below 100% of the federal poverty line, you are not going to receive Medicaid and you're not eligible for the subsidies,\" says Morrisey.\n\n\"So it's not at all surprising that they're going to say it's too expensive and they're going to remain uninsured,\" he continues. \"I'm guessing that a third of that 34% who will remain uninsured are in that group.\"\n\nBankrate's Health Insurance Pulse survey was conducted between Feb. 20 and March 9 by Princeton Survey Research Associates International with a nationally representative sample of 3,005 adults living in the continental United States.

The divide is more equitable than before the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as California\u2019s insurance market is now \u201cmoderately concentrated\u201d instead of \u201chighly concentrated,\u201d according to a measure of market share called the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, said researchers at Kaiser, a Menlo Park, California-based nonprofit that focuses on health care.\n\n\u201cThere are some examples of smaller or newer plans being able to get a sizable piece of the market in the exchanges, but by and large a lot of the players in the exchanges that are the biggest were the biggest before as well,\u201d Cynthia Cox, a senior analyst at Kaiser, said in a phone interview.\n\nAbout 5 million Americans had signed up for private health plans through yesterday using the law\u2019s insurance exchanges, according to the U.S. government. The exchanges were intended to ease access and improve transparency for people who shop for insurance on their own, about 5 percent of the U.S. population. Democrats who wrote the law also hoped to break the dominance of some companies that existed in many states.\n\nIn California, WellPoint Inc.\u2019s Anthem brand signed up about 30 percent of the 869,000 people who used the state\u2019s health exchange, Covered California, by March 1. Anthem had 47 percent of the state\u2019s market before plans started to be sold on the new health exchanges on Oct. 1.\n\nState Changes\n\nWellPoint also lost ground in New York and Nevada, where it fell from 28 percent and 34 percent of the market, respectively, to 18 percent and 12 percent, Kaiser said in its report released yesterday. In Connecticut, WellPoint\u2019s plans now hold 60 percent of the market from 45 percent before major provisions of the law known as Obamacare took effect.\n\nKristin Binns, a WellPoint spokeswoman, cautioned against drawing conclusions from the Kaiser data, which exclude customers whose plans were renewed from prior years and people who signed up without using exchanges.\n\nBefore the health-care law, one insurance company held at least half the individual market in 30 states, according to the Kaiser report. That remains true in some states, even after the major provisions of Obamacare took effect this year. In Minnesota, for example, PreferredOne, a closely held company based in Golden Valley, Minnesota, has taken about 59 percent of customers on the state\u2019s exchange, MNsure.\n\nEnrolling Customers\n\nBefore the health law, the state\u2019s Blue Cross Blue Shield plan had 59 percent of the market, while PreferredOne had 3 percent. Blue Cross Blue Shield now has 24 percent share.\n\nThe Kaiser report said that PreferredOne took share by offering \u201csome of the lowest exchange premiums in the country\u201d for plans with very narrow networks of hospitals and doctors.\n\nAbout 95 percent of Americans have a choice of two or more insurance carriers in their state exchanges, Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services said in an e-mail. The government said in September that about 25 percent of companies offering plans on the exchanges were new to the individual market.\n\n\u201cAll consumers shopping in the marketplaces also have greater transparency where they can compare comprehensive, affordable plans side by side to find the one that best meets their needs,\u201d she said.\n\nOpen enrollment for exchange plans closes for 2014 on March 31.\n\nCopyright 2017 Bloomberg.","88":"Obamacare advocates are working to mobilize young adults, a demographic that's key to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s success, to sign up for insurance through the federal marketplace ahead of the March 31 deadline for open enrollment. But with sign-ups among 18- to 34-year-olds lagging behind expectations nationally, pro-reform groups are targeting Texas \u2014 with its large, youthful population \u2014 in an effort to up their numbers.\n\nIn February, for the second consecutive month, young adults made up 27 percent of those who had successfully purchased coverage through the online insurance marketplace in Texas, compared to 25 percent of those who enrolled nationally, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\n\nThe Obama administration has said that young adults \u2014 who are generally healthy and have fewer medical costs \u2014 should make up 40 percent of those insured through the marketplace to offset the costs of older, higher-risk patients and keep premiums down.\n\n\u201cThe next couple of weeks are going to be instrumental,\u201d said Sara Smith, program director for the pro-ACA Texas Public Interest Research Group, which advocates on consumer issues. \u201cWe have two weeks to inform the state\u2019s most uninformed health care consumers.\u201d\n\nJohn Davidson, senior health care policy analyst for the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation, said that will be a futile battle, given that costs for young people under Obamacare aren't minimal.\n\n\u201cThe ACA was sold as something that would make health care cheaper. A lot of people are going on the exchange expecting their plans to be free or very inexpensive, and that\u2019s just not the case,\u201d he said. \u201c...Young, healthy people aren\u2019t going to want to pay rates like this, especially if they don\u2019t have to go to the doctor.\"\n\nBefore the implementation of the ACA, insurance companies often charged a five-to-one ratio or higher for monthly premiums based on a consumer's age, according to America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the national trade association representing the health insurance industry. The new law limits this ratio to three to one. In order to make this system work, the Obama administration has said that young adults need to enroll at high enough rates to yield a surplus in premium revenue \u2014 which insurance companies can then allocate to help cover the expected deficit created by lower premiums for older patients.\n\nThe Texas Public Interest Research Group started its campaign, Health Insurance 101, to give young adults information on their health care enrollment options. They have canvassed on Texas college campuses, hired student interns at several schools and pushed university officials and student body leaders to send out the group's information guide and email reminders about ACA deadlines.\n\nSmith said the group is also focusing on future users of the marketplace: \u201cMaybe they are a 24-year-old senior on their parents\u2019 plan. They aren\u2019t always going to be that way,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother national pro-ACA group, Young Invincibles, was a presence at the recent South By Southwest festival in Austin, and has established enrollment stations at bars in the state's urban areas. The group also created an app called Healthy Young America that can be used to calculate premiums and find health care services.\n\n\u201cWe rarely have young people tell us they don\u2019t want to sign up,\" said Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1nchez, the group's southern regional organizing director. \"It\u2019s usually that they didn\u2019t know about the deadline or subsidies.\"\n\nSupporters of health reform are hopeful there will be a surge in sign-ups among young adults in the final days of the open enrollment period. \u201cI\u2019m confident that these numbers will spike before the deadline,\u201d said Stacey Pogue, a senior health care policy analyst for the liberal Center for Public Policy Priorities.\n\nIf they don't, the ACA has protective measures built in to avoid major increases in premiums for the first two years. A study by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation concluded that if rates among young people stay at around 25 percent, it will not be catastrophic for the system \u2014 but insurance companies would likely increase premiums to protect their profits.\n\nDavidson, with the Texas Public Policy Foundation, said he believed cost was the top impediment for young people seeking health coverage. For example, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation subsidy calculator, a single 25-year-old making $20,000 per year and living at 174 percent of the federal poverty line would need to pay $1,021 each year for coverage \u2014 and that's after the government subsidy.\n\nIf young people were suddenly going to start enrolling in large numbers, Davidson said, \"we would have seen it by now.\u201d\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan health policy research and communication organization not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.","89":"With the March 31 enrollment deadline only two weeks away, a top administration official reported a big upswing in public interest in subsidized health insurance and said traffic on the federal website HealthCare.gov reached 1 million visitors over the weekend.\n\n\u201cThe last several days have been the busiest since December,\u201d Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a government blog posting that announced the new total.\n\nThe 5 million enrollee total marked an increase of at least 800,000 people since March 1, indicating that total enrollment could approach the 6 million figure estimated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office if enrollment surges in the final weeks as administration officials have predicted.\n\nCBO initially forecast 7 million enrollees in private health coverage but scaled back its estimate after technical problems with the rollout that continue to afflict Obamacare insurance marketplaces operated by several states.\n\nMonday\u2019s release did not say how many new enrollees are adults aged 18-34, a younger demo- graphic whose participation is seen as essential for the success of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement.\n\nBefore the rollout, administration officials said their goal was for 38 percent of the new online private insurance market- places to consist of younger consumers, who compensate for older, sicker enrollees because they tend to be healthy and cheaper to insure. But the data so far shows young adults accounting for only one-quarter of enrollees.\n\nAnother important section consists of people signing up for insurance for the first time, a group that also tends to be healthy. The administration says it has no data for that group but the consulting firm McKinsey & Co put the number at around 27 percent of the total enrollees in a report this month.\n\nToo few healthy beneficiaries could cause healthcare costs to rise as insurers grapple with higher insurance risks posed by policyholders who are sick or older.\n\n\u201cFive million is only a good number if it\u2019s mostly people who didn\u2019t have insurance before,\u201d said Joe Antos of the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is expected to extend health insurance to millions of uninsured Americans through the private marketplaces and an expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor.\n\nBut the 2010 law\u2019s implementation has been dogged by delays, legal challenges and political attacks from Republicans and other critics.\n\nU.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told Congress last week that the administration will not extend the March 31 enrollment deadline.\n\nBut the law allows people who have difficulty signing up for coverage to arrange for special enrollment periods.

The paper adds:\n\n\n\n\"If the pace continues, the Obama administration may come close to registering 6 million sign-ups in the first year that Americans are able to get guaranteed health coverage under the Affordable Care Act. \"That would still fall short of the goal of 7 million that administration officials had hoped to reach before the botched rollout of the new law last fall. \"How many people have actually paid for the health insurance plans they have selected remains uncertain. \"Administration officials have not released data on payments.

The idea behind that was that competition among plans would yield the best deals for consumers.\n\nThere also was the assumption that the marketplace could give individuals the clout of being part of a large group similar to people enrolled in a large, employer-based plan.\n\nResistance\n\nThe health-reform law gave states the option of establishing their own marketplace or participating in a federally run exchange.\n\nAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 17 states have their own exchanges. The remaining states are relying on the federal marketplace or created a hybrid federal-state operation.\n\nIn many instances, as in Missouri and Kansas, the decision not to establish a state exchange stemmed from conservative Republican and\/or voter opposition to Obamacare.\n\nIn November 2012, Missouri voters approved a proposition barring the governor or any state agency from helping establish an exchange without legislative or voter approval.\n\nKansas Gov. Sam Brownback, a conservative Republican who ran for office campaigning against the health reform law, rejected $31.5 million in federal grant money that would have allowed the state to build its own exchange. He also rejected a plan that would have let the state partner with the federal government on a marketplace, opting instead for one run solely by the national government.\n\nFinal push\n\nAt the Shepherd\u2019s Center in Kansas City, Seymour said, \u201ceverybody is ready and up to the challenge of getting these last-minute people enrolled. We are going to pull out all the stops and do whatever we need to do.\u201d\n\nShepherd\u2019s Center is among the various groups in Missouri and Kansas that are working to inform people that time is running out to buy insurance for 2014 through the marketplace. The next enrollment period starts in November.\n\nAmong the initiatives in the Kansas City metro area are Enroll Wyandotte, the coalition that sponsored the recent health fair, and CoverKC, a $700,000 effort bankrolled by the Health Care Foundation of Greater Kansas City.\n\nThe St. Louis-based Missouri Foundation for Health has a statewide project called Cover Missouri.\n\nIn Kansas, the state insurance department is working with KAMU and other outside organizations to spread the word about the Obamacare health plans.\n\nVarious activities\n\nHere are some of the efforts to date and plans for the next couple of weeks:\n\n\u2022 Cover Missouri: Has helped enroll about 68,000 Missourians for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, said Ryan Barker, health policy vice president at the Missouri Foundation for Health. That total includes some people who turned out to be eligible for Medicaid. With a multimedia campaign on tap, Barker said he hopes the effort can have 130,000 people enrolled by the end of the month.\n\n\u2022 Among KAMU\u2019s efforts is a text messaging campaign. And various KAMU members are running their own ad campaigns and enrollment events, including an \u201cenrollment blitz\u201d scheduled from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Center for Health and Wellness in Wichita. The Wyandotte Health Department will be taking enrollments from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on the deadline day.\n\n\u2022 CoverKC: Since January, workers have knocked on more than 35,000 doors in the urban cores of Kansas City, Mo., and Kansas City, Kan., according to Jessica Hembree, program and policy officer for the Health Care Foundation of Greater Kansas City. Organizers said they hope to have knocked at 70,000 doors by the end of this month, supplemented by mail, telephone and digital marketing.\n\n\u2022 Enroll Wyandotte workers aim to have reached about 18,000 residents by the end of the month, said Jerry Jones, executive director of the Community Health Council of Wyandotte County. By the end of the next enrollment period, which ends in mid-January, Jones said the goal is to have 12,000 previously uninsured county residents enrolled in plans through the marketplace.\n\nEnrollment workers said the federal website is working much better than it did last fall.\n\nField workers said it still can take upwards of two, three or five hours to enroll, if the case is complex, but that they are cautiously optimistic the anticipated surge of sign-ups in the next couple of weeks will not lead to another meltdown.\n\n\u201cWe hope the process works better,\u201d said Linda Sheppard, special counsel and director of health care policy and analysis at the Kansas Department of Insurance. \u201cI assume it will. We will see what happens.\u201d","95":"By Stephen T. Watson, The Buffalo News, N.Y. McClatchy-Tribune Information Services\n\nMarch 18 --The state insurance exchange established as part of the Affordable Care Act opened New York's insurance market for individuals to more competition, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported Monday.\n\nThe foundation found that the individual insurance market had more companies offering coverage in 2014, after the NY State of Health exchange was put in place, compared with 2012, before the exchange was introduced as part of federal health care reform efforts.\n\nFor example, in 2012, the top two insurers, Wellpoint (including Empire BlueCross BlueShield) and UnitedHealth , served 48 percent of New York's individual market. In 2014, preliminary exchange enrollment figures show that the top insurers, Wellpoint and a new company, Freelancers (including Health Republic Insurance ), accounted for only 34 percent of the market.\n\nOr, by another measure, in 2012, five insurers had 5 percent or more of the individual market, while in 2014 seven insurers had at least that much of the market.\n\nThe foundation points out that the individual insurance market historically hasn't been competitive. In 2010, when the Affordable Care Act was passed, a single insurer had more than half the individual insurance market in 30 states.\n\nNew York was one of seven states whose individual insurance markets were studied by the foundation, and New York's were found to be the most competitive under the exchange.\n\nThe findings in the Kaiser Family Foundation report mirror the insurer exchange enrollment data released in January by the state Health Department .\n\nAnd the foundation report also confirms The Buffalo News article from December that talked to experts who predicted the exchange would open up the local insurance market to competition from new insurers.\n\nCompanies that didn't previously offer insurance in Western New York , or weren't active in the individual or group markets here, include Health Republic Insurance and Fidelis Care .\n\nThe foundation report looks at statewide numbers and does not break down the New York individual insurance market by region. The Health Department has yet to release regional numbers for exchange enrollment by insurer.\n\nPeople who buy individual coverage make up a small percentage of the overall insurance market.\n\nThe vast majority of people get their health insurance through an employer or through a government program such as Medicaid or Medicare .\n\nemail: swatson@buffnews.com\n\n___\n\n(c)2014 The Buffalo News (Buffalo, N.Y.)\n\nVisit The Buffalo News (Buffalo, N.Y.) at www.buffalonews.com\n\nDistributed by MCT Information Services","96":"The Department of Health and Human Services broke the news on Monday that 5 million people have now signed up for healthcare coverage under the Affordable Care Act. With 14 days left in the open enrollment period, it appears that the final numbers will come close to or even reach the initial Congressional Budget Office estimates of 7 million people signing up in the first year. While the CBO has since amended that number down to 6 million, don\u2019t be surprised if this final push gets it well above that.\n\nBelow is the press release from the website of the HHS:\n\nAs this historic open enrollment period enters its final weeks, millions of Americans are finding quality, affordable coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act. Fernando Valdez and Denise Schroeder were part of a weekend wave of consumers signing up for new coverage and bringing enrollment nationwide to more than 5 million through the Federal and State-based Marketplaces since October 1st. Fernando Valdez, 25, of El Paso, Texas woke up early on Saturday, after his mother insisted that he walk to an enrollment center and enroll in Marketplace coverage. Now, he will pay $22 a month for his health insurance. Fernando said that he walked away knowing that if \u201cI get into an accident I will not be in trouble with trying to find health care.\u201d Read more about Fernando\u2019s story at: http:\/\/www.elpasotimes.com\/news\/ci_25353816\/enroll-el-paso-makes-push-get-residents-enrolled?IADID=Search-www.elpasotimes.com-www.elpasotimes.com. And Denise Schroeder says she now feels like \u201cI have a whole new life\u201d after enrolling in coverage in recent days. Denise, a small business owner in West Chester, Pennsylvania who runs \u201cHappy Heart Clown N\u2019Stuff\u201d which does balloon decorating and entertainment for parties is also a cancer survivor. Because she had cancer, Denise knew she couldn\u2019t let her health coverage lapse, but the $880 premium she was paying each month wiped out her savings account, and she said it was killing her. But after working with an enrollment navigator, she enrolled on Thursday in a Silver Plan for $22 a month. When she saw the new premium, she cried. You can find more stories like theirs at http:\/\/www.hhs.gov\/healthcare\/facts\/mystory\/index.html. Consumers like Fernando and Denise are coming every day to check out their options for affordable health care at HealthCare.gov or seeking help from a trained representative in person or via our 24\/7 call center. The last several days have been the busiest since December, with the Call Center taking more than 198,000 calls on Thursday alone -the busiest day since December 23\u2014and more than 130,000 calls over the weekend. Last week, HealthCare.gov saw more than 4 million visits\u2014and an additional 1 million visits this weekend. With only two weeks to go, we\u2019re continuing to work hard to ensure that every American who wants to enroll in affordable coverage by the deadline of March 31st is able to do so. So don\u2019t delay; tell your friends and family to sign up today.\n\nThree weeks ago, ACA enrollment passed 4 million. Since then, we\u2019ve seen another million sign up. No matter how much Republicans try to deny it, the ACA is going to be a rousing success in in its first year. Conservative pundits had a field day laughing at the \u2018paltry\u2019 enrollment numbers in October, apparently unaware that fewer people sign up at the beginning of an enrollment period than at the end. The message a few months ago was how there was NO WAY that millions of people would sign up for Obamacare. Conservatives kept bringing up that 7 million figure from the CBO and pointing out how much lower the final enrollment figure would be.\n\nFor months, the narrative, repeated over and over by the mainstream media, was about the \u2018botched\u2019 rollout of the ACA and the \u2018disastrous\u2019 Healthcare.gov website. While news anchors and pundits were repeating the same talking points day in and day out, whatever glitches that were hounding the website were found and fixed, and people in need of affordable health care continued to sign up.\n\nNow here we are, two weeks away from the final deadline of this enrollment period, and we now see 5 million people have signed up. 5 million people have obtained quality healthcare because of this law. All despite the numerous roadblocks thrown up by Republican lawmakers trying their hardest to make the law fail before it even had a chance to be enacted. How many more would have had a chance to sign up already if the majority of states would have set up their own healthcare exchanges? If Red state governors would have allowed Medicaid expansion to take place, as provided for by the ACA, how many more people would have health coverage right now?\n\nThat\u2019s the thing. Even with the petulant obstruction, 5 million people have signed up for healthcare under the ACA, and in the years to come, tens of millions more will. It is the law of the land. It is here to stay.","97":"To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThe surprise victory of Republican David Jolly for a congressional seat in Florida has given new life to voters who had been depressed about the power of the Obama campaign machine. Even more surprising to the media was that Obamacare turned out to be the winning issue for Republicans.\n\nThe Democratic congressional candidate outspent the Republican by a million dollars, and it was a district that President Barack Obama carried in 2012. But the Democratic candidate's message about Obamacare, \"fix, don't repeal\" and \"mend, don't amend,\" was a loser because the American people want Obamacare repealed.\n\nThe Democrats had thought Obama's favorite legislation would be a political advantage by now. It would have given health insurance to millions of voters who never had it before, others would enjoy subsidies and free contraceptives, and all had confidence in Obama's promise, \"If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor\" (and your health insurance plan and your hospital).\n\nIt must have been a rude awakening for many liberals to realize that it was all a lie, and you really can't keep your doctor or your insurance plan. Liberals now have to face the fact that not only Obama made a false promise, but that he and his staff knew it was a lie when they wrote it on his teleprompter.\n\nMillions of Americans have had their health insurance canceled. And the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reports that Obamacare will cause more than 2 million Americans to lose their jobs.\n\nNancy Pelosi told members of Congress they had to pass Obamacare so we can all find out what's in it. We are finding out more and more things we don't like about it every day.\n\nObama's game plan to dodge the Obamacare bullet is to announce an exemption or a waiver or a deadline change almost every week. The purpose seems to be to postpone as many obnoxious deadlines as possible so that they do not take effect until after this year's November election.\n\nThe scholar Grace-Marie Turner of the Galen Institute reports that the administration has made 37 significant changes to Obamacare, of which at least 20 were made unilaterally by Obama with his famous \"pen.\"\n\nOnly 15 were made legally by Congress.\n\nObamacare is a disaster any way you look at it. It violates the Constitution by forcing individual Americans to buy things we don't need or want, and to pay for other people to buy products we don't approve of.\n\nSo what do we have to show for the high cost of Obamacare? Lost jobs, full-time jobs cut to part-time jobs, canceled health insurance policies, higher premiums for health insurance, a website that doesn't work (so people don't know if they are signed up or not), and navigators, who couldn't pass a background check, to help us navigate the website.\n\nObamacare was designed to conceal its extraordinary cost by depending on healthy young people signing up to compensate the insurance companies for the high costs of unhealthy seniors. And we've just discovered a previously unnoticed fine-print provision to require taxpayers to bail out the insurance companies if they lose money on that deal.\n\nThe Obama administration is trying to save face by claiming that Obamacare's only problems are with the website and implementation. In fact, the real problem is the socialist mindset that the government can take over a sixth of our economy and do it better and cheaper, and that's ridiculous because higher taxes, more inconvenience and lots of bailouts are what prevail.\n\nThe big government takeover of an entire industry is driving up health care costs, imposing new taxes, increasing our national debt, encouraging Obama to function like a dictator by unilaterally changing the law, and destroying our once-great health care system.\n\nThe administration claims that 4.2 million people have signed up, which is a lot fewer than the original 7 million goal. But the real joker is that many of these people haven't paid their first premium. Like shopping at the supermarket, they've put some items in their cart, but they haven't yet paid at the checkout counter, so we don't know the real numbers.\n\nBut we do know that more people have lost health insurance than have been able to get new insurance. The Associated Press reported that at least 4.7 million Americans received notices that their current health insurance policies were canceled, and that's more than the 4.2 million who have signed up.\n\nMost of Obama's changes were to help 2014 Democratic candidates, who are running away from Obamacare faster than they are running for office. The solution for Americans is to elect a conservative Senate in November that will repeal Obamacare.\n\nPhyllis Schlafly is a lawyer, conservative political analyst and author of 20 books.

In a sit-down interview with WebMD posted Friday, the president dismissed any concern that people resisting the law could somehow keep it from functioning. ... During the wide-ranging interview with WebMD's Lisa Zamosky, Obama also called out governors and state lawmakers who have resisted the health care law's massive expansion of Medicaid -; a decision he said was based purely on politics. \"This is a source of great frustration for me,\" he said. \"We don't have the ability at the federal level to pressure those states to do what they should be doing\" (Cheney, 3\/14).\n\nReuters: Obama Says Enough People Signed Up To Make U.S. Healthcare Law Work\n\nPresident Barack Obama, aiming to allay concerns about the viability of his signature healthcare law, said on Friday enough people have enrolled to make its insurance marketplaces stable. \"Well, at this point, enough people are signing up that the Affordable Care Act is going to work,\" Obama said in an interview with the medical website WebMD (Dunham, 3\/14).\n\nCBS News: Obama: I'm Confident Health Markets Will Be Stable\n\nThe administration will most likely fall short of its original enrollment goals for the new Obamacare marketplaces, but President Obama thinks enough people are enrolling to prop up the new insurance marketplace. \"The pool is already large enough,\" Mr. Obama said in an interview with the medical website WebMD, published Friday. \"I'm confident the program will be stable.\" The president's remarks come amid criticism of the way his administration is handling the individual mandate -- a policy that the White House says is critical to sustaining the marketplace (Condon, 3\/14).\n\nCNN: President Further Distances Him self From Obamacare 'Doctor' Pledge\n\n\"If you have or had one of these plans before the Affordable Care Act came into law and you really like that plan, what we said was you could keep it if it hasn't changed since the law was passed,\" Obama said in a speech to supporters of the Affordable Care Act.

We\u2019re really working with them from square one,\u201d said Misty Kruger of the Shawnee County Health Agency in Topeka.\n\nThe agency hired certified navigators and counselors to help people get enrolled and stationed the workers at the public library, a popular community gathering spot, with hours that extend into the evenings and weekends.\n\nEarlier this month in Kansas City, Kan., organizers held a two-day health fair as part of efforts to get the word out.\n\nSalvador Lopez, an Excelsior Springs, Mo. farm worker, was among those who attended the event. He came with his wife and two daughters.\n\nHe said he would like health insurance so he could afford diabetes medicine. The coverage also could help his wife, who said she wasn\u2019t feeling well as she had her blood pressure checked.\n\nLopez said Medicaid already covers his daughters and he was optimistic he would be able to find a plan he could afford through the new marketplace.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to help me a lot,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI would say the majority of people that we see have no idea what health insurance is, have never had it,\u201d said Pam Seymour, executive director of Shepherd\u2019s Center Central. The nonprofit has two locations in Kansas City, Mo., and has more than a dozen trained workers to help individuals navigate the enrollment process using the federal website.\n\nSurge expected\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported last that 4.2 million people nationwide had purchased exchange plans through the end of February. The Congressional Budget Office had originally projected that 7 million people would enroll in private plans in the first year of the marketplace. Last month it revised that downward to 6 million.\n\nThe latest numbers from HHS included about 104,000 people who were signed up in Missouri and Kansas. According to federal estimates, about 1.1 million people in the two states are uninsured and eligible to participate in the exchange. Nationally, the number of uninsured people in 2012 was estimated at about 47 million.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that about 6 million people will get coverage through the Obamacare marketplaces this year, about 20 percent less than originally projected.\n\nBut officials said they are expecting there will be a flurry of enrollments at or near the deadline.\n\n\u201cWhat we are finding,\u201d HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said with the release of the new enrollment numbers, \u201cis that as more Americans learn just how affordable marketplace insurance can be, more are signing up.\u201d\n\nA department spokeswoman said agency officials were \u201cbusy preparing to handle an anticipated surge in enrollment as we approach the end of March.\u201d\n\nHHS officials said they had hired an additional 2,000 workers for the department\u2019s help line \u2013 bringing the total to about 14,000 representatives.\n\nDrafters of the Affordable Care Act intended the health insurance marketplaces to operate much like online systems that allow shoppers to compare prices on airline tickets or hotel rooms. The idea behind that was that competition among plans would yield the best deals for consumers.\n\nThere also was the assumption that the marketplace could give individuals the clout of being part of a large group similar to people enrolled in a large, employer-based plan.\n\nResistance\n\nThe health-reform law gave states the option of establishing their own marketplace or participating in a federally run exchange.\n\nAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 17 states have their own exchanges. The remaining states are relying on the federal marketplace or created a hybrid federal-state operation.\n\nIn many instances, as in Missouri and Kansas, the decision not to establish a state exchange stemmed from conservative Republican and\/or voter opposition to Obamacare.\n\nIn November 2012, Missouri voters approved a proposition barring the governor or any state agency from helping establish an exchange without legislative or voter approval.\n\nKansas Gov. Sam Brownback, a conservative Republican who ran for office campaigning against the health reform law, rejected $31.5 million in federal grant money that would have allowed the state to build its own exchange.

We are going to pull out all the stops and do whatever we need to do.\u201d\n\nShepherd\u2019s Center is among the various groups in Missouri and Kansas that are working to inform people that time is running out to buy insurance for 2014 through the marketplace. The next enrollment period starts in November.\n\nAmong the initiatives in the Kansas City metro area are Enroll Wyandotte, the coalition that sponsored the recent health fair, and CoverKC, a $700,000 effort bankrolled by the Health Care Foundation of Greater Kansas City.\n\nThe St. Louis-based Missouri Foundation for Health has a statewide project called Cover Missouri.\n\nIn Kansas, the state insurance department is working with KAMU and other outside organizations to spread the word about the Obamacare health plans.\n\nVarious activities\n\nHere are some of the efforts to date and plans for the next couple of weeks\n\n\u2022 Cover Missouri: Has helped enroll about 68,000 Missourians for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, said Ryan Barker, health policy vice president at the Missouri Foundation for Health. That total includes some people who turned out to be eligible for Medicaid. With a multimedia campaign on tap, Barker said he hopes the effort can have 130,000 people enrolled by the end of the month.\n\n\u2022 Among KAMU\u2019s efforts is a text messaging campaign. And various KAMU members are running their own ad campaigns and enrollment events, including an \u201cenrollment blitz\u201d scheduled from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Center for Health and Wellness in Wichita. The Wyandotte Health Department will be taking enrollments from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on the deadline day.\n\n\u2022 CoverKC: Since January, workers have knocked on more than 35,000 doors in the urban cores of Kansas City, Mo., and Kansas City, Kan., according to Jessica Hembree, program and policy officer for the Health Care Foundation of Greater Kansas City. Organizers said they hope to have knocked at 70,000 doors by the end of this month, supplemented by mail, telephone and digital marketing.\n\n\u2022 Enroll Wyandotte workers aim to have reached about 18,000 residents by the end of the month, said Jerry Jones, executive director of the Community Health Council of Wyandotte County. By the end of the next enrollment period, which ends in mid-January, Jones said the goal is to have 12,000 previously uninsured county residents enrolled in plans through the marketplace.\n\nEnrollment workers said the federal website is working much better than it did last fall.\n\nField workers said it still can take upwards of two, three or five hours to enroll, if the case is complex, but that they are cautiously optimistic the anticipated surge of sign-ups in the next couple of weeks will not lead to another meltdown.\n\n\u201cWe hope the process works better,\u201d said Linda Sheppard, special counsel and director of health care policy and analysis at the Kansas Department of Insurance. \u201cI assume it will.

Treating it can cost $2,290. Then there's the broken arm: On average $7,700. And people without health insurance get to pay full freight.\n\nOr as U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius put it in a government blog: \"This can be a huge financial blow to young people and families alike.\"\n\nThat is the message the administration hopes will be heard by college-age kids and others who do not have health insurance, but could qualify for federal subsidies to help purchase coverage. Some could also qualify for the Medicaid health program for the poor.\n\nOpen enrollment ends March 31.\n\nIn a promotion aimed at fans of the annual college basketball playoff series known as March Madness, Sebelius' Department of Health and Human Services and the President's Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition released data looking at the economic costs of common sports injuries like sprains and fractures - just the sort of thing to send a young person to the emergency room.\n\nYoung people are vital to the success of President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law. Obamacare prevents insurance companies from penalizing people who are sick or older. And so the new marketplaces need young people who are cheaper to insure to make up for the higher financial risks posed by others.\n\nBut so far, the administration's target audience of people aged 18 to 34 have not been signing up in such large numbers, a trend that could lead to higher insurance costs down the road if it continues.\n\nMore than 5 million people have enrolled in private health insurance under Obamacare, according to the administration. But the latest breakdown shows the number of younger adults stuck at 25 percent of the enrollment population, versus the 38 percent target that the administration laid out before last October's botched rollout.\n\nAdministration officials say younger people could sign up in huge numbers in the final days of the open enrollment period.","107":"WASHINGTON - Sports injuries sent nearly 2 million people to U.S. emergency rooms in 2012 and the cost can be particularly devastating for young people without insurance, the administration said Tuesday.\n\nWith a shortage of young people signing up for Obamacare, the Department of Health and Human Services is using March Madness to urge basketball and other sports fans to enroll in a health care plan by the March 31 deadline.\n\n\n\nIn order to stress the importance of health coverage, HHS and the President's Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition released new data looking at the cost of treating common sports injuries.\n\nThe most common sports injuries were ankle or knee sprains and leg fractures, according to the new data. The estimated rates of sports-related injuries were higher among children and young adults under the age of 25.\n\nAn estimated 12 million people between the ages of 5 and 22 years suffer a sports-related injury annually, the data found. About 20 percent of all injury-related ER visits involve children and teens aged 6 to 19.\n\n\n\nIt can be costly to treat even a minor sports injury, HHS said. For instance, a sprained ankle can cost a person $2,20, while charges for a broken arm average nearly $7,700.\n\n\"That broken arm would take almost 10 years to pay off at that rate without considering interest or harm to your credit,\" HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius wrote on her blog.\n\n\"Whether you're out on the slopes or playing the boss in a pickup game of basketball after that stressful meeting, you don't want to have to hold back because you aren't covered in case of injury,\" she said.\n\nMiami Heat forward and former Duke University star Shane Battier told reporters during a press conference Tuesday that he's personally had over 90 stitches, 25 ankle sprains, over 50 X-rays and MRIs and now has early-onset arthritis from his athletic career.\n\n\"There is a health risk that comes from playing sports...chances are you're going to get banged up at some point,\" he said. \"Play hard, be smart and get covered.\"\n\nPeople can sign up for health insurance 24 hours a day, seven days a week online at HealthCare.gov, which Sebelius said is now working smoothly, or by calling 1-800-318-2596.\n\nTo get in-person help in your own community, visit localhelp.healthcare.gov and punch in your zip code.\n\nPeople who miss the March 31 deadline will have to wait until November 2014 before they can enroll again.","108":"404\n\nSorry, the page you requested was not found.\n\nPlease check the URL for mistakes.

Alvarez\/AP Luis M. Alvarez\/AP\n\nEver since Republicans began using the words \"repeal and replace\" back in 2010 to describe their intentions for the Affordable Care Act, they've faced a question: What, exactly, would they replace it with?\n\nWhile there's currently no clear Republican alternative for the health care law, President Obama's signature domestic achievement, the House Republican leadership is signaling there will be one this year.\n\nThe signal came in the form of an interview The Washington Post's Robert Costa had with House Majority Whip Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the third-highest-ranking official in the House GOP's leadership.\n\nThe goal: give voters a clear way to distinguish the Republican and Democratic approaches as part of the GOP plan to bludgeon Democrats with the controversial health care law at every opportunity this midterm election year.\n\nWhile there apparently isn't yet a detailed alternative to analyze, the concepts being considered as part of the proposed replacement are far from new. Indeed, they've been part of Republican alternatives from conservative think tanks like the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation.\n\nThe final GOP package could include old standbys like health savings accounts, expanding state-run high-risk pools for the hardest-to-insure individuals, and the sale of insurance across state lines.\n\nOne immediate problem for Republicans is that these ideas don't exactly have buy-in from the insurance industry like, say, the individual mandate did, and without its backing, they would be hard to pull off.\n\nIndeed, the insurance industry might be expected to fiercely lobby with its ample war chest against some, if not all, the GOP proposals.\n\n\"Every insurance industry executive I talk to thinks those proposals are silly,\" said Robert Laszewski, a health care industry expert, in an interview with It's All Politics. In a blog post, Laszewski explains industry officials' objections to GOP proposals, such as selling insurance across state lines.\n\nAnother problem for the Republican proposals is that they could undermine two of the health care law's most popular features \u2014 the ban against insurance companies declining to insure people with pre-existing conditions (or charging prohibitive amounts to do so) and the ability of parents to keep their children, up to age 26, on their insurance plans.\n\n\"Bingo,\" said Laszewski, when I raised this problem with him. When the ACA banned pre-existing conditions as a reason for not insuring someone, it obviated the need for the state-run high-risk pools, which is where people with pre-existing conditions formerly would turn.\n\nA return to such high-risk pools would by definition mean revisiting a time when insurance companies used pre-existing conditions to exclude certain people.\n\n\"I can't imagine a Republican candidate wanting to go into a November election suggesting we go back on pre-existing conditions,\" Laszewski said.\n\nLaszewski, no fan of how the Affordable Care Act was fashioned, is also skeptical of the Republican approach from what he's seen so far.\n\n\"I've been critical of the Obama people because they built Obamacare and they never really consulted people in the industry when they did it. That's one of the big reasons they got the mess that they do,\" Laszewski said. \"And so here go the Republicans. Instead of doing something out of a left-wing think tank, the Republicans are doing it out of a right-wing think tank.\"","113":"The Note's Must-Reads are a round-up of today's political headlines and stories from ABC News and the top U.S. newspapers.

The quickening pace of sign-ups confirms that many Americans are using the new marketplaces as a March 31 deadline approaches for getting coverage this year. The latest figures indicate that roughly 1 million people enrolled during the last two weeks, surpassing the total for all of February.

Less than a week ago, the administration said 4.2 million had signed up for coverage through the end of February, meaning that about 800,000 people have enrolled so far in March. That's good news for the Obama administration; the number of enrollments had fallen from 1.1 million in January to 942,000 in February.

About 800,000 people selected health plans on the state and federal insurance marketplaces in the beginning of March, officials said in a blog post - almost as many as signed up during the entire month of February.

REUTERS\/Kevin Lamarque\n\nWASHINGTON More than 5 million people have enrolled in private health insurance under the law known as Obamacare since open enrollment began on October 1, the Obama administration said on Monday.\n\nWith the March 31 enrollment deadline only two weeks away, a top administration official reported a big upswing in public interest in subsidized health insurance and said traffic on the federal website HealthCare.gov reached 1 million visitors over the weekend.\n\n\"The last several days have been the busiest since December,\" Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a government blog posting that announced the new total.\n\nThe 5 million enrollee total marked an increase of at least 800,000 people since March 1, indicating that total enrollment could approach the 6 million figure estimated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office if enrollment surges in the final weeks as administration officials have predicted.\n\nThe CBO initially forecast 7 million enrollees in private health coverage, but scaled back its estimate after technical problems with the rollout that continue to afflict Obamacare insurance marketplaces operated by several states.\n\nMonday's release did not say how many new enrollees were adults aged 18 to 34, a younger demographic whose participation is seen as essential for the success of President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement.\n\nBefore the rollout, administration officials said their goal was for 38 percent of the new online private insurance marketplaces to consist of younger consumers, who compensate for older, sicker enrollees because they tend to be healthy and cheaper to ensure. But the data so far shows young adults accounting for only one-quarter of enrollees.\n\nAnother important section consists of people signing up for insurance for the first time, a group that also tends to be healthy. The administration says it has no data for that group, but the consulting firm McKinsey & Co in a report this month put the number at around 27 percent of the total enrollees\n\nToo few healthy beneficiaries could cause healthcare costs to rise as insurers grapple with higher insurance risks posed by policyholders who are sick or older.\n\n\"Five million is only a good number if it's mostly people who didn't have insurance before,\" said Joe Antos of the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\n\nMARCH 31 DEADLINE\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is expected to extend health insurance to millions of uninsured Americans through the private marketplaces and an expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor.\n\nBut the 2010 law's implementation has been dogged by delays, legal challenges and political attacks from Republicans and other critics.\n\nU.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told Congress last week that the administration would not extend the March 31 enrollment deadline.\n\nBut the law allows people who have difficulty signing up for coverage to arrange for special enrollment periods. With huge volumes expected in the final days of the open enrollment period, analysts say 2014 enrollment may not reach its final total until sometime after March.\n\nSeparately, California's state health insurance exchange said on Monday its enrollment passed the 1 million mark, with 1,018,315 people selecting a health plan through the exchange as of Saturday. Those numbers are part of the Obamacare enrollment figures.\n\n\"California continues to lead the nation in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and the numbers released today illustrate strong progress in the push to expand health care coverage as we head into the final weeks of open enrollment,\" California Assocation of Health Plans' Chief Executive Patrick Johnston said in a statement.\n\n(Editing by Chris Reese, Mohammad Zargham and Peter Cooney)","117":"You are the owner of this article.","118":"Obamacare short of enrollment target ahead of March 31 deadline\n\nBy Kate Randall\n\n18 March 2014\n\nThe Obama administration is conducting an all-out push to sign up new enrollees for the Affordable Care Act before the March 31 deadline. According to regulations of the legislation popularly known as Obamacare, those without insurance through their employer or a government program such as Medicare or Medicaid must obtain insurance by the end of this month, or pay a tax penalty in 2015.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reported last week that about 940,000 people signed up for plans through Obamacare in February, bringing the total to about 4.2 million, far short of the Obama administration\u2019s original 5.7 million projection. People shopping for health insurance must select from plans offered by private insurers through the insurance exchanges set up under the ACA.\n\nIn addition to the overall low enrollment figures, the number of young people signing up is also far below original government forecasts. The administration had originally projected that those between the ages of 18 and 34 would account for 38.5 percent of enrollees. Of those signing up between October 1, 2013, and March 1 of this year, only 25 percent were in this age group.\n\nThe White House and private insurance companies are counting on young, healthy people signing up to offset the higher cost of insuring older, less healthy people. Insurance companies are depending on a sufficient influx of cash-paying, younger enrollees to maintain their profit margins. Under the ACA, the insurers are still allowed to charge three times as much for premiums for older enrollees.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s efforts to court young people have included an interview with \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d host Ryan Seacrest on his radio program last Friday, which followed a March 11 appearance on the comedy interview web series \u201cBetween Two Ferns with Zach Galifiankis.\u201d The president\u2019s last-ditch maneuvers are taking on an increasingly desperate and cynical character.\n\nThe latest marketing campaign by administration health care officials focuses on \u201cMarch Madness,\u201d the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball tournaments that begin this week. Beginning Monday, Obama, some of his aides, and celebrity basketball players and coaches will conduct interviews, feature in public service ads and make appeals on social media. Obama was set to release Monday night a \u201c16 Sweetest Reasons to get Covered\u201d bracket modeled on the predictions for winners of the NCAA tournament.\n\nIn an effort to target the Hispanic audience, Obama was scheduled to appear Monday on the Univision Radio program \u201cLocura Deportive\u201d (Sports Madness), while ESPN Deportes will interview White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough.\n\nIn an interview Friday on the popular health information site WebMD, the president stated he was confident enough people have signed up for Obamacare to make the program \u201cstable.\u201d However, pointing to the main purpose of his interview, he stressed \u201cthe more you can spread the risk with more people, the better deal you\u2019re going to get.\u201d He added, \u201cYou know, the impact in terms of the program has always been based more on the mix of people who sign up.\u201d\n\nWhile touting the law\u2019s virtues, he acknowledged that lower-cost policies on the health care exchanges may have limited choices of doctors and other providers. \u201cFor the average person,\u201d Obama said, \u201cmany folks don\u2019t have insurance initially, they\u2019re going to have to make some choices. And they may have to switch doctors, in part because they\u2019re saving money.\u201d\n\nThe president added that people may discover that a network \u201cis more expensive than another network, and maybe you\u2019ve got to make a choice about what\u2019s right for your family.\u201d In other words, the substandard plans are the only thing you and your family can afford, but because of the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d you must purchase it or pay a penalty.\n\nA survey by consulting firm McKinsey & Company reports that only about a quarter of the 4.2 million people signing up for insurance through the Obamacare exchanges through February were previously uninsured. This means that the program has so far made only a tiny dent in the estimated 48 million uninsured Americans.\n\nThe survey also found that of those shopping on the exchanges, only about half actually signed up for coverage, citing high premium prices as the reason for not buying insurance. They failed to enroll after visiting an online exchange despite the fact that four in five of this group qualified for government subsidies to purchase insurance under Obamacare.\n\nIn an appearance last month before the House Ways and Means Committee, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius stated that ACA \u201cpremiums are likely to go up, but at a smaller pace than what we\u2019ve seen since 2010.\u201d While she failed to specify precisely what this \u201csmaller pace\u201d would look like in practice on the exchanges, other data on insurance premiums indicates private insurers will be hiking premiums substantially.\n\nAccording to a report from eHealthInsurance, an online private insurance exchange, Americans purchasing coverage outside the Obamacare exchanges are seeing premiums up to 56 percent higher than before the health law took effect. The report shows families paying an average of $663 a month, with premiums as high as $2,604 a month for a family in California, and $1,845 in New York.\n\nAccording to eHealthInsurance, rates have jumped as insurers shift the cost of covering the added features of the ACA to consumers. While the insurers are now required to cover certain essential health benefits, and cannot deny coverage to people with preexisting conditions, they are not sacrificing their profits to do so. This is placing individuals and families who are not insured through their employers, and in general do not qualify for government subsidies, in an impossible financial position.\n\nA substantial number of people facing these huge premium hikes are those whose insurance was cancelled because it did not meet the ACA standards. The White House faced a backlash last year when several million people received notices of cancellation, contradicting Obama\u2019s claim that \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep your plan.\u201d\n\nThese people were eventually given the option of keeping their plans temporarily in those states where insurance commissions allowed it. In the latest reported tweak to the health care law, these people have now been given a permanent exemption from the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d\n\nYou can now fill out a form attesting that you \u201cbelieve that the plan options available in the [ACA] Marketplace in your area are more expensive than your cancelled health insurance policy\u201d or \u201cyou consider other available policies unaffordable.\u201d In other words, you will be exempted from the requirement to purchase qualified insurance, and can dodge the penalty, but you will be left without any health coverage whatsoever.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.","119":"If you have an event you'd like to list on the site, submit it now!\n\nSubmit","120":"Photo by MANDEL NGAN\/AFP\/Getty Images\n\nAnother Obamacare press release, another milestone that falls short of original goals. The Department of Health and Human Services reported today that five million people have now signed up for insurance through the government exchanges. The administration had hoped to enroll seven million by the March 31 deadline. After the bungled rollout, that estimate was revised down to six million.\n\nWhile total sign-ups still lag both targets, the pace is picking up slightly, as the administration had hoped would be the case in the final weeks and days of open enrollment. 800,000 people applied for coverage so far in March, compared to 1.1 million in all of February. The latest release does not report the ages of enrollees, information that has been closely watched by the administration and insurers. Of particular interest is the percentage of sign-ups who are between the ages of 18 and 34, a healthy demographic needed to keep costs down.\n\n","121":"Something has gone wrong...\n\nPut it before them briefly so they will read it, clearly so they will appreciate it, picturesquely so they will remember it and, above all, accurately so they will be guided by its light. -- Joseph Pulitzer","122":"Close Get email notifications on Tanasia Curtis daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\nWhenever Tanasia Curtis posts new content, you'll get an email delivered to your inbox with a link.\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.","123":"USA :: Health Issues :: Print this Article\n\nDEFIANT AMERICANS: A THIRD OF UNINSURED REFUSE TO BUY OBAMACARE\n\n03-17-2014 5:07 pm - Greg Richter - NewsMax.com\n\nA third of Americans currently uninsured still have no intention of buying health coverage even though they are required to do so by the Affordable Care Act, according to Bankrate's latest Health Insurance Pulse survey.\n\n\n\nThirty-four percent contacted by telephone said they still have no intention of buying insurance. Most, 41 percent, cited cost as their reason, while 17 percent said they oppose Obamacare and 13 percent said they are healthy and don't need insurance.\n\n\n\nFifty-six percent of those surveyed said they do plan to purchase health coverage.\n\n\n\n\"We did all this discombobulating for nothing, because the uninsured are not signing up,\" Fox News Channel's Neil Cavuto said on Monday.\n\n\n\n\"It's hard to generalize, but for some of these folks, it's a case of, 'I'm in pretty good health, I don't think about these things, I know I can't afford it now,'\" Michael Morrisey, professor of health economics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Public Health told Bankrate. \"I think it's just rolling past them, and they're not giving it a whole lot of attention.\"\n\n\n\nThe debate swirled even as the administration announced that more than 5 million had now enrolled in private health insurance under Obamacare since open enrollment began on Oct. 1.\n\n\n\nThe tally is an increase of at least 800,000 enrollees since March 1, with volume rising as the six-month enrollment period approaches its deadline on March 31. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that enrollment could total 6 million, but private estimates have suggested a lower turnout.\n\n\n\nIn the Bankrate survey, only 30 percent were aware of tax credits designed to offset costs, but those making less than $30,000 a year \u0097 who are more likely to benefit from them \u0097 were in the group most likely to know about the credits.\n\n\n\nIt is mostly men who won't buy insurance over opposition to Obamacare. Twenty-two percent of men cited that as the reason as opposed to 8 percent of women.\n\n\n\nMost opponents of the Affordable Care Act are Republican, so it's not surprising that half of uninsured Republicans cited opposition to Obamacare as their reason to remain uninsured. Only 5 percent of those who identify as Democrats cited opposition to the ACA as their reason.\n\n\n\nAnd it is mostly the young who say they won't buy insurance because they are healthy. Thirty-one percent of respondents age 18-29 cited that reason. Only 6 percent of those 30-49 said they were healthy enough to remain uninsured.\n\n\n\nDeborah Chollet, a health insurance research leader at Mathematica Policy Research in Washington, D.C., told Bankrate that the multimedia advertising campaigns targeting the \"young invincibles\" may have missed another target group: low-income, young families.\n\n\n\n\"They're probably not spending a lot of time watching television, they never read a newspaper, and if they listen to radio, it's probably music in the car,\" she said. \"In communities of color, people might hear about [Obamacare] in church, but for people who are not attached to a church, I don't know how they get the information.\"\n\n\n\nSabrina Corlette, research professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute, told Bankrate that the Obama administration may have focused too much on positive aspects of the law, such as tax subsidies, rather than the penalties imposed for not buying insurance.\n\n\n\n\"They found in Massachusetts, with 'RomneyCare,' that the individual mandate penalty absolutely motivated a lot of people to purchase insurance,\" Corlette said. \"The Obama administration understandably tried to emphasize the positive, but people need to understand that the mandate is not insignificant \u0096 they could be hit with a big tax bill if they don't buy coverage.\"\n\n\n\nAlso, only 48 percent of the uninsured were aware they have only until March 31 to sign up. After that, they have to wait for next year's open enrollment, which begins November 15. The only exceptions are life changes such as a divorce or lost job.\n\n\n\nDr. Jane Hughes, an ophthalmologist, told Fox News that the Department of Health and Human Services and Medicare and Medicaid Services say they aren't keeping track of who had insurance and who didn't when they are signing up.\n\n\n\n\"It's absolutely not been worth the hassle, and I know why we did all of this: This was a socio-political agenda to take over one-sixth of the private sector economy using my profession \u0097 medicine \u0097 to do it.\"\n\n\n\nSix million have been bumped off insurance plans because of Obamacare. 4.2 million have signed up. \"If we had a big neon sign over Healthcare.gov it would be minus-1.8 million now enrolled.

The administration has updated the enrollment tally twice a month since millions of customers were required to pay their premiums, but officials have declined yet again to disclose payment information.\n\n\n\nMonday\u0092s unscheduled update revealed that the administration can now count 5 million selected plans on Obamacare exchanges across the country \u0097 1 million in California alone. It\u0092s a desperately needed coup for the administration, which is two weeks away from the final enrollment deadline.\n\n\n\nBut like Tavenner\u0092s other surprise enrollment updates, the blog post is devoid of details or statistics. Instead, it\u0092s chock full of stories about those who were so happy to receive Obamacare that they cried.\n\n\n\nOfficial monthly enrollment announcements merit a conference call with media and a formal state breakdown from the Department of Health and Human Services. But detailed demographic information wasn\u0092t released until mid-January \u0097 over halfway through the open enrollment period.\n\n\n\nThe late release emphasized the administration\u0092s failure to enroll nearly enough of its key demographic, healthy people aged 18 to 35. Through February\u0092s end, Obamacare exchange customers were only 25 percent \u0093young invincibles\u0094 \u0097 leaving very little time to meet the administration\u0092s prior minimum target of 39 percent.\n\n\n\nAs of January, customers that paid have been using their Obamacare insurance. But the Obama administration continues to say it doesn\u0092t know how many have paid their premiums.\n\n\n\nThe best estimates come from consulting firms\u0092 studies of data from insurance companies. Goldman Sachs\u0092 latest indicates that 80 percent of the number the White House has advertised will follow through and purchase their coverage; McKinsey estimates only 77 percent. Such a record would bring that 5 million down to 3.85-4 million instead.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------\n\nSOURCE: http:\/\/dailycaller.com\/2014\/03\/17\/how-many-have-paid-obamacare-premiums\/\n\n","126":"404\n\nSorry, the page you requested was not found.\n\nPlease check the URL for mistakes.

But the data so far shows young adults accounting for only one-quarter of enrollees.\n\nAnother important section consists of people signing up for insurance for the first time, a group that also tends to be healthy. The administration says it has no data for that group, but the consulting firm McKinsey & Co in a report this month put the number at around 27 percent of the total enrollees\n\nToo few healthy beneficiaries could cause healthcare costs to rise as insurers grapple with higher insurance risks posed by policyholders who are sick or older.\n\n\"Five million is only a good number if it's mostly people who didn't have insurance before,\" said Joe Antos of the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\n\nMARCH 31 DEADLINE\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is expected to extend health insurance to millions of uninsured Americans through the private marketplaces and an expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor.\n\nBut the 2010 law's implementation has been dogged by delays, legal challenges and political attacks from Republicans and other critics.\n\nU.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told Congress last week that the administration would not extend the March 31 enrollment deadline.\n\nBut the law allows people who have difficulty signing up for coverage to arrange for special enrollment periods. With huge volumes expected in the final days of the open enrollment period, analysts say 2014 enrollment may not reach its final total until sometime after March.\n\nSeparately, California's state health insurance exchange said on Monday its enrollment passed the 1 million mark, with 1,018,315 people selecting a health plan through the exchange as of Saturday. Those numbers are part of the Obamacare enrollment figures.\n\n\"California continues to lead the nation in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and the numbers released today illustrate strong progress in the push to expand health care coverage as we head into the final weeks of open enrollment,\" California Assocation of Health Plans' Chief Executive Patrick Johnston said in a statement. (Editing by Chris Reese, Mohammad Zargham and Peter Cooney)","128":"The surprise victory of Republican David Jolly for a congressional seat in Florida has given new life to voters who had been depressed about the power of the Obama campaign machine. Even more surprising to the media was that Obamacare turned out to be the winning issue for Republicans.\n\nThe Democratic congressional candidate outspent the Republican by a million dollars, and it was a district Barack Obama carried in 2012. But the Democratic candidate\u2019s message about Obamacare \u2013 \u201cfix, don\u2019t repeal\u201d and \u201cmend, don\u2019t amend\u201d \u2013 was a loser, because the American people want Obamacare repealed.\n\nThe Democrats thought that Obama\u2019s favorite legislation would be a political advantage by now. It would have given health insurance to millions of voters who never had it before, others would enjoy subsidies and free contraceptives, and all had confidence in Obama\u2019s promise that \u201cif you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor\u201d (and your health insurance plan, and your hospital).\n\nIt must have been a rude awakening for many liberals to realize that it was all a lie, and you really can\u2019t keep your doctor or your insurance plan. Liberals now have to face the fact not only that Obama made a false promise, but that he and his staff knew it was a lie when they wrote those promises on his teleprompter.\n\nMillions of Americans have had their health insurance canceled. And the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reports that Obamacare will cause more than 2 million Americans to lose their jobs.\n\nNancy Pelosi told members of Congress they had to pass Obamacare so we can all find out what\u2019s in it. We are finding out more things we don\u2019t like about it every day.\n\nObama\u2019s game plan to dodge the Obamacare bullet is to announce an exemption or a waiver or a deadline change almost every week. The purpose seems to be to postpone as many obnoxious deadlines as possible so that they do not take effect until after this year\u2019s November election.\n\nThe scholar Grace-Marie Turner of the Galen Institute reports that the administration has made 37 significant changes to Obamacare, at least 20 made unilaterally by Obama with his famous \u201cpen.\u201d Only 15 were made legally by Congress.\n\nObamacare is a disaster any way you look at it. It violates the Constitution by forcing individual Americans to buy things we don\u2019t need or want and to pay for other people to buy products we don\u2019t approve of.\n\nSo what do we have to show for the high cost of Obamacare? Lost jobs, full-time jobs cut to part-time jobs, canceled health insurance policies, higher premiums for health insurance, a website that doesn\u2019t work so people don\u2019t know if they are signed up or not, and navigators to help us navigate the website who couldn\u2019t pass a background check.\n\nDon\u2019t miss Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s latest book, now available at the WND Superstore: \u201cNo Higher Power: Obama\u2019s War on Religious Freedom\u201d\n\nObamacare was designed to conceal its extraordinary cost by depending on healthy young people signing up to compensate the insurance companies for the high costs of unhealthy seniors. And we\u2019ve just discovered a previously unnoticed fine-print provision to require taxpayers to bail out the insurance companies if they lose money on that deal.\n\nThe Obama administration is trying to save face by claiming that Obamacare\u2019s only problems are with the website or implementation. In fact, the real problem is the socialist mindset that the government can take over a sixth of our economy and do it better and cheaper, and that\u2019s ridiculous because it ends up with higher taxes, more inconvenience and lots of bailouts.\n\nThe big-government takeover of an entire industry is driving up health care costs, imposing new taxes, increasing our national debt, encouraging Obama to function like a dictator by changing the law unilaterally and destroying our once-great health-care system.\n\nThe administration claims that 4.2 million people have signed up, which is a lot fewer than the original 7 million goal. But the real joker is that many of those haven\u2019t paid their first premium. Like shopping at the supermarket, they\u2019ve put some items in their cart, but they haven\u2019t yet paid at the checkout counter, so we don\u2019t know the real numbers.\n\nBut we do know that more people have lost health insurance than have been able to get new insurance. The Associated Press reported that at least 4.7 million Americans received notices that their current health insurance policies were canceled, and that\u2019s more than the 4.2 million who have signed up.\n\nMost of Obama\u2019s changes were to help Democratic 2014 candidates who are running away from Obamacare faster than they are running for office. The solution for Americans is to elect a conservative Senate in November that will repeal Obamacare.","129":"Battle-fatigued voters might not have noticed it and\/or might have willfully ignored it, but the 2017 election season has slipped into the atmosphere, enticing voters to prepare themselves for action should they be into that kind of thing. Lest you think this \"2017 election\" is some kind of sick...","130":"But before the president and his team start popping the champagne corks to celebrate their achievement and their faux hipness, it\u2019s time once again to point out that the administration\u2019s Potemkin enrollment figures should be read with a truckload of salt. As the New York Times reported last month, as much as 20 percent of all those enrolled had not actually paid their premiums, meaning they were not covered by the program. While Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius told Congress she had no idea what the numbers of unpaid enrollees were, more states are reporting these figures and, as CNBC reported last week, the results are literally all over the map. While some states report high pay rates, others like Maryland say only 54 percent have paid.\n\nAll this calls in to question not only the effectiveness of the sales job done by the president and celebrity supporters such as Lebron James. It also means that the odds that this system can sustain itself without mandating vast increases in rates for those who do pay are getting slimmer every day.\n\nFor months we\u2019ve been told by the administration that the only problem with ObamaCare was a \u201cglitchy\u201d website that had since been fixed. But what has since become clear is that the effort to convince young and healthy Americans to sign up for insurance that is both expensive and not something they may need is a failure. Though many of those who clearly benefit from the new health law, such as the poor and those with pre-existing conditions, have signed up, the scheme requires large numbers of those who won\u2019t need the coverage as often in order to be economically viable. That problem will be exacerbated by the failure of much larger percentages of customers to pay for their insurance.\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted previously, the non-payment of the premium is not a technicality. Many of those purchasing the insurance may be first-time buyers and not understand that they must pay their bill before coverage starts rather than long after the fact, as they can with a credit card transaction. Or it may be that some enrolled with no intention of paying or thinking that the hype about the glories of ObamaCare they\u2019ve heard in the mainstream media and from the president absolved them of the obligation to pay for it. But either way, the large number of non-payments renders the enrollment figures meaningless and ensures that the rates for those who do pay are going up next year by percentages that will shock them.\n\nThe president claimed that the number of enrollees has already reached the point where the law will work rather than collapse from lack of participation. But even if we accept his premise that falling millions of customers short of the announced goal of seven million is no big deal, the fact that hundreds of thousands of those being counted in the pool of those he\u2019s counting are not covered because of non-payment of premiums makes his assertion a colossal fraud.\n\nThe president may think that a March madness ad blitz during the NCAA basketball tournament may save ObamaCare. But if the past pattern holds, any further surge in enrollment will provide the scheme with a false sense of security. Until we get a full accounting not only of those who signed up on a website but completed the process by paying for the plan they chose, we\u2019ll have no idea how many people truly are enrolled. Seen in that light, the president\u2019s enrollment promises may well turn out to be no different from other pledges he has made about the ACA in the last few years: completely untrue.","131":"Page Not Found\n\nWe're sorry, but we seem to have lost this page.","132":"The promise of quality, affordable health care is quickly becoming reality for more and more Americans.

But after the federal website stumbled in the early weeks, the administration discounted that target.\n\nStill, in the waning days, the sign-up rate is increasing. It took 20 days for the last 1 million to sign up. By contrast, there were fewer than 1 million sign-ups in all of February.\n\nUnder Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate, Americans must have health insurance by the end of March or else they will have to pay a penalty in their 2014 taxes.\n\nLast week, however, Republicans said they\u2019d discovered a loophole that will allow anyone who claims a \u201chardship\u201d to refuse to sign up and still not have to face a penalty. The new hardship exemption was added to the forms in December, but went unnoticed by analysts until last week.\n\n\u201cFrankly, I think the American people deserve some explanation as to what the White House really is doing,\u201d House Speaker John A. Boehner told reporters last week.\n\nBut House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said the 5 million people who have signed up for health plans are all evidence for why the GOP\u2019s efforts to repeal the law are a bad idea.\n\n\u201cEach new enrollee is a reminder of the real, human cost of each of the 51 Republican votes to repeal or undermine this legislation,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s allies are ramping up their efforts to try to boost the number of enrollees, as are administration officials.

Despite the challenges, he was able to bring about positive changes in the lives of Americans. Let\u2019s take a look back at some key achievements of the Obama Administration. Continue reading Thanks, Obama \u2192","136":"WASHINGTON \u2013 More than 5 million people have now signed up for health insurance on marketplaces created by President Obama\u2019s healthcare law, thanks to a surge in enrollment over the last two weeks, the Obama administration announced Monday.\n\nThe quickening pace of sign-ups confirms that many Americans are using the new marketplaces as a March 31 deadline approaches for getting coverage this year.\n\nThe latest figures indicate that roughly 1 million people enrolled during the last two weeks, surpassing the total for all of February.\n\nIf the pace continues, the Obama administration may come close to registering 6 million sign-ups in the first year that Americans are able to get guaranteed health coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThat would still fall short of the goal of 7 million that administration officials had hoped to reach before the botched rollout of the new law last fall.\n\nHow many people have actually paid for the health insurance plans they have selected remains uncertain.\n\nAdministration officials have not released data on payments. Unofficial estimates from insurance companies and some state-run marketplaces suggest that as many as 20% of consumers in some markets have yet to pay their premiums, although some of those may not yet have been billed.\n\nNonetheless, 6 million sign-ups would mark an important accomplishment for the health law\u2019s supporters, who feared that the marketplaces might collapse after the disastrous launch of the HealthCare.gov website in October.\n\n\u201cAs this historic open enrollment period enters its final weeks, millions of Americans are finding quality, affordable coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Medicare chief Marilyn Tavenner, whose agency is overseeing the marketplaces, wrote in a blog post Monday.\n\nDrawing on the experience of previous government health programs, the administration and many outside experts had long predicted a rush to sign up for coverage during the final few weeks. In particular, they have predicted that some groups, including young people and Latinos, whose participation in the marketplaces so far has lagged behind others', increasingly would sign up as the deadline approached. The administration did not release a demographic breakdown Monday for the latest enrollments.\n\nThe state-based marketplaces -- a centerpiece of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare -- enable Americans who do not get health coverage through work to select among plans that offer at least a basic set of benefits. The plans cannot turn away sick people.\n\nConsumers who make less than four times the federal poverty level, or about $94,000 for a family of four, qualify for government subsidies to offset the cost of their premiums.\n\nnoam.levey@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @NoamLevey","137":"With just two weeks remaining before the window slams shut on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s open enrollment period, unquestionably, the best advice for the uninsured is to run \u2013 don\u2019t walk \u2013 to get help with the enrollment process. But once you\u2019ve made that decision to enroll, this advice is equally critical: Avoid the huge rookie error of buying the cheapest plan available and focus on finding plans that fit your situation.\n\nThere\u2019s not just good news and bad news. There\u2019s very good news and very bad news.\n\nThe very good news is that \u2013 chances are \u2013 you\u2019ll find that good coverage will cost you less than you might expect because of the availability of tax credits and subsidies to help you afford insurance. By the end of February, 4.2 million Americans had enrolled in a health plan through either a state or federal exchange and, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, more than 8 of every 10 people qualified for the financial assistance provided under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe federal subsidies are available to individuals with incomes up to $42,000 \u2013 and families of four up to $94,000 \u2013 but you can\u2019t get them unless you enroll through an exchange. (This site provides a calculator that can help people determine how much financial help they might be eligible for.)\n\nThe very bad news is that if you miss the March 31 deadline, you will only be able to enroll in a plan for 2014 through an Obamacare exchange if you experience a significant life change, such as getting married or losing your job. If you remain uninsured, you may be liable for a penalty of up to 1 percent of your income.\n\nAvoid \u2018buyers\u2019 remorse\u2019\n\nEnrolling in a health plan is much easier than it used to be, but it\u2019s still not as easy as ordering a book from Amazon.com. You\u2019ll have to plug in information about yourself (and you family, if applicable), and you\u2019ll have to sort through what in some states can be a bewildering array of choices.\n\nPremiums vary based on how much you\u2019re willing to pay out of your own pocket if you get sick or injured. Platinum- and Gold-level plans have higher premiums than Silver and Bronze plans, but they cover a greater percentage of medical costs.\n\nA lot of people undoubtedly are making decisions based only on the amount of the monthly premium and giving little consideration to what they\u2019ll have to shell out if they have to be admitted to the hospital or undergo expensive outpatient treatment. That can prove to be a costly mistake. I\u2019m already hearing from people who wished they had spent more time evaluating their options.\n\nOne such person is Donna Smith, a cancer survivor and executive director of Health Care for All Colorado Foundation, who told me that in retrospect, she should have called the insurance companies she was considering to figure out more precisely how much money she\u2019d have to pay on her own if she got sick again. Sure enough, right after the first of this year when the policy she selected last fall went into effect, she was hospitalized for a week and had to undergo a series of tests.\n\nSmith said it hadn\u2019t occur to her that picking a Gold or Platinum level plan with a higher premium could have been better deal than the Silver Kaiser Permanente plan she opted for and that seemed to be more affordable.\n\nAfter her stay in the hospital, however, she found out some limitations of her coverage that made her overall financial responsibility much higher. For one thing, hospitalization under her plan required a co-insurance payment of 30 percent. She said that if she had shopped more carefully, she would have discovered that there were other Silver plans that required a co-insurance payment for inpatient care of only 20 percent.\n\n\u201cIn retrospect,\u201d she said, \u201cI needed to ask much more detailed questions about the coverage. I believe now that I would have done better with one of the Gold Kaiser plans that might have cost another $150 to $200 per month but saved me from these higher costs of getting sick.\u201d\n\nPlenty of help available\n\nOne of the things to keep in mind is that help is available. It\u2019s not just you and your computer. If you are uncertain about the choices you see online, you by all means should contact one of the specially trained Obamacare navigators in your area or a licensed agent or broker.\n\nRachel DeGolia, a Cleveland, Ohio-based navigator, says many people who seek her help, especially people who\u2019ve been uninsured for a long time, have a very limited understanding of how health insurance works.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big learning curve,\u201d she said.\n\nOne of the things she helps many people with is helping them determine if their doctor or a specific hospital is in the network of a health plan they are considering. The plans offered by many health insurers have what is referred to as \u201cnarrow networks,\u201d meaning the list of doctors and other health care providers and facilities available to health plan enrollees can be very limited.\n\n\u201cThe narrow networks can be a problem,\u201d DeGolia said. \u201cYou really hate to break people up with their doctors.\u201d\n\nShe said it\u2019s easier to determine if a hospital is in a network than a doctor. She and her fellow navigators have access to a grid showing which hospitals are in which health plan networks. No such grid exists for doctors, however.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t figure out if doctor is in plan or not,\u201d she said. \u201cYou either have to call the doctor or call the plan itself, and even some doctors\u2019 staff might not even know.\u201d\n\nOne of the things navigators cannot do by law is make specific recommendations. They can\u2019t tell you that one plan might be a better value than any other plan. They are limited to providing education and information.\n\nKnowing that, you might want to consider contacting a licensed insurance agent or broker \u2013 and one that belongs to the National Association of Health Underwriters (NAHU) \u2013 before making your final selection of a health plan.\n\nAs NAHU, which represents more than 100,000 health insurance professionals, points out on its website, before deciding which policy is best for you or you and your family, you need to consider a number of factors, such as the scope of what you want to cover, your degree of risk toleration, the network of medical providers available, and the monthly cost.\n\nUnlike a navigator, a licensed agent can explain the benefits and potential shortcomings of various plans and help you pick a plan that best fits your needs. One of the reasons for making certain that the agent you talk with is a member is NAHU, by the way, is that as part of their membership, NAHU members agree to abide by a code of ethics that requires them to make health care coverage recommendations with the customer\u2019s best interest in mind. NAHU points out that while agents receive commissions from insurance carriers, the commissions cover \u201cnot only the selling of the plan but much of the servicing required\u201d after the sale-\u201cso service after the sale\u2026is just as important as the sale itself.\u201d\n\nBottom line: If you still haven\u2019t enrolled in a health plan, don\u2019t procrastinate any longer. It might take more than a few minutes in front of your computer to find a plan that best meets your needs. And it might be in your best financial interest to contact a navigator and very possibly a licensed insurance agent or broker in your state.","138":"The U.S. administration said on Monday that more than 5 million people have now enrolled in private health insurance under the program known as Obamacare, since open enrollment began on Oct. 1.\n\nThe tally is an increase of at least 800,000 enrollees since March 1, with volume rising as the six-month enrollment period approaches its deadline on March 31. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that enrollment could total 6 million, but private estimates have suggested a lower turnout.\n\nThe announcement, in a government blog posted by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Marilyn Tavenner, did not say how many new enrollees are the younger adults that President Barack Obama needs to make his new health insurance marketplaces a success.\n\nBut Tavenner said the pace of enrollment has been at its highest since late December, when there was a rush of interest from people who wanted coverage beginning Jan. 1.\n\nShe said the federal website HealthCare.gov had 1 million online visitors over the weekend and more than 4 million visitors last week. A federal call center set up to take applications over the telephone had more than 198,000 calls last Thursday.","139":"4129117\n\nThe Obama administration made its sixth update of the year on Obamacare enrollment Monday \u2014 without ever revealing how many customers have paid.\n\nA blog post from Marilyn Tavenner, director of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, boasts 5 million sign-ups so far. The administration has updated the enrollment tally twice a month since millions of customers were required to pay their premiums, but officials have declined yet again to disclose payment information.\n\nMonday\u2019s unscheduled update revealed that the administration can now count 5 million selected plans on Obamacare exchanges across the country \u2014 1 million in California alone. It\u2019s a desperately needed coup for the administration, which is two weeks away from the final enrollment deadline.\n\nBut like Tavenner\u2019s other surprise enrollment updates, the blog post is devoid of details or statistics. Instead, it\u2019s chock full of stories about those who were so happy to receive Obamacare that they cried.\n\nOfficial monthly enrollment announcements merit a conference call with media and a formal state breakdown from the Department of Health and Human Services. But detailed demographic information wasn\u2019t released until mid-January \u2014 over halfway through the open enrollment period.\n\nThe late release emphasized the administration\u2019s failure to enroll nearly enough of its key demographic, healthy people aged 18 to 35. Through February\u2019s end, Obamacare exchange customers were only 25 percent \u201cyoung invincibles\u201d \u2014 leaving very little time to meet the administration\u2019s prior minimum target of 39 percent.\n\nAs of January, customers that paid have been using their Obamacare insurance. But the Obama administration continues to say it doesn\u2019t know how many have paid their premiums.\n\nThe best estimates come from consulting firms\u2019 studies of data from insurance companies. Goldman Sachs\u2019 latest indicates that 80 percent of the number the White House has advertised will follow through and purchase their coverage; McKinsey estimates only 77 percent. Such a record would bring that 5 million down to 3.85-4 million instead.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

So it\u2019s important to have a plan rather than just allow the Democrats to complain that the Republicans are the \u2018party of no,\u2019\u201d Glen Bolger , a Republican pollster and cofounder of Public Opinion Strategies, tells TIME. \u201cHowever, this issue will be three parts about Obamacare and one part about the Republican alternative in this election.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe core message is running against Obamacare. That is the most effective message,\u201d says Whit Ayres , a GOP pollster and president of North Star Opinion Research. \u201cIt becomes even more effective when we can answer the question: What's your alternative?\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner and his allies will try to answer that question this year, reports The Washington Post , presenting a set of \u201cprinciples\u201d to mark the party's official position on health care reform. Among the alternative policies under consideration include the creation of high-risk insurance pools, medical malpractice reform, and allowing people to buy health care insurance across state lines. The key, says Ayres, is \u201callowing people to buy the coverage they want and can afford, rather than being forced to buy expensive comprehensive policies.\u201d\n\nWhile various conservative bills have been presented over the years, only recently have Republicans focused its main energy from \u201crepeal\u201d to \u201crepeal and replace.\u201d A month ago the Senate put forth \u201cthe most comprehensive and most serious alternative\u201d to the Affordable Care Act since it was introduced, according to Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation, which the House will look to for guidance.\n\nRepublicans would have to win elections before seeing their ideas turn into fruition, as the Democrat-controlled Senate and President Obama have guarded the Affordable Care Act from GOP attempts to repeal, defund or fundamentally reform the law. And with 5 million now enrolled in its health care exchanges, the law will be near impossible to replace completely. Even so, Boehner figures positioning the GOP as a \"party of alternatives\" will convince voters it's serious about governing.\n\nBut it'll be tempting for Republican candidates in 2014 to focus on blanket opposition to the Affordable Care Act. Nearly 54 percent of the public opposes the Affordable Care Act, according to an aggregation of polls compiled by Real Clear Politics . Its popularity hasn't risen much since 2010, when Boehner, then House Minority Leader, held a rousing \u201c Hell, No!\u201d call-and-response with his conference against the bill. As Boehner and his lieutenants move toward a potential replacement four years later, Bolger expects that the country will remain intent on the existing legislation.\n\n\"Voters are focused on Obamacare so much\u2014it is the law, and has been debated for five years,\" he says. \u201cThe GOP alternative won\u2019t get anywhere near the attention levels.\u201d\n\nSo despite the new calls for change, don\u2019t be surprised to hear the echoes of Hell No.","141":"Barack Obama faced many unique barriers to success during his tenure as President of the United States.

Just last week, the administration announced 4.2 million enrollees.\n\nOf last week\u2019s pool of enrollees, 25% were between the much-needed ages of 18 and 24. Monday\u2019s announcement did not include a demographic breakdown.\n\nThe White House\u2019s enrollment goal was revised down from its original projection of 7 million enrollees in year one with 2.7 million of them being young Americans. The younger demographic is necessary to keep the insurance pools balanced to help offset the costs of insuring older and less healthy people.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services counts enrollees as anyone who has selected a plan on either a state or the federal exchange. Typically, the insurance industry counts individuals as enrolled once they have paid their first month\u2019s premium.\n\nDuring her testimony on HHS\u2019 budget for 2015 last week, Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told members of Congress that she had \u201cno idea\u201d how many people had made their premium payments because the government does not collect that information.

Vote in Urgent National Poll\n\nA third of Americans currently uninsured still have no intention of buying health coverage even though they are required to do so by the Affordable Care Act, according to Bankrate's latest Health Insurance Pulse survey.Thirty-four percent contacted by telephone said they still have no intention of buying insurance. Most, 41 percent, cited cost as their reason, while 17 percent said they oppose Obamacare and 13 percent said they are healthy and don't need insurance.Fifty-six percent of those surveyed said they do plan to purchase health coverage.\"We did all this discombobulating for nothing, because the uninsured are not signing up,\" Fox News Channel's Neil Cavuto said on Monday.\"It's hard to generalize, but for some of these folks, it's a case of, 'I'm in pretty good health, I don't think about these things, I know I can't afford it now,'\" Michael Morrisey, professor of health economics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Public Health told Bankrate. \"I think it's just rolling past them, and they're not giving it a whole lot of attention.\"The debate swirled even as the administration announced that more than 5 million had now enrolled in private health insurance under Obamacare since open enrollment began on Oct. 1.\n\nThe tally is an increase of at least 800,000 enrollees since March 1, with volume rising as the six-month enrollment period approaches its deadline on March 31. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that enrollment could total 6 million, but private estimates have suggested a lower turnout.\n\nEditor's Note:\n\nShould ObamaCare Be Defunded? Vote in Urgent National Poll\n\nIn the Bankrate survey, only 30 percent were aware of tax credits designed to offset costs, but those making less than $30,000 a year \u2014 who are more likely to benefit from them \u2014 were in the group most likely to know about the credits.It is mostly men who won't buy insurance over opposition to Obamacare. Twenty-two percent of men cited that as the reason as opposed to 8 percent of women.Most opponents of the Affordable Care Act are Republican, so it's not surprising that half of uninsured Republicans cited opposition to Obamacare as their reason to remain uninsured. Only 5 percent of those who identify as Democrats cited opposition to the ACA as their reason.And it is mostly the young who say they won't buy insurance because they are healthy. Thirty-one percent of respondents age 18-29 cited that reason. Only 6 percent of those 30-49 said they were healthy enough to remain uninsured.Deborah Chollet, a health insurance research leader at Mathematica Policy Research in Washington, D.C., told Bankrate that the multimedia advertising campaigns targeting the \"young invincibles\" may have missed another target group: low-income, young families.\"They're probably not spending a lot of time watching television, they never read a newspaper, and if they listen to radio, it's probably music in the car,\" she said. \"In communities of color, people might hear about [Obamacare] in church, but for people who are not attached to a church, I don't know how they get the information.\"Sabrina Corlette, research professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute, told Bankrate that the Obama administration may have focused too much on positive aspects of the law, such as tax subsidies, rather than the penalties imposed for not buying insurance.\"They found in Massachusetts, with 'RomneyCare,' that the individual mandate penalty absolutely motivated a lot of people to purchase insurance,\" Corlette said. \"The Obama administration understandably tried to emphasize the positive, but people need to understand that the mandate is not insignificant \u2013 they could be hit with a big tax bill if they don't buy coverage.\"Also, only 48 percent of the uninsured were aware they have only until March 31 to sign up. After that, they have to wait for next year's open enrollment, which begins November 15. The only exceptions are life changes such as a divorce or lost job.Dr. Jane Hughes, an ophthalmologist, told Fox News that the Department of Health and Human Services and Medicare and Medicaid Services say they aren't keeping track of who had insurance and who didn't when they are signing up.\"It's absolutely not been worth the hassle, and I know why we did all of this: This was a socio-political agenda to take over one-sixth of the private sector economy using my profession \u2014 medicine \u2014 to do it.\"Six million have been bumped off insurance plans because of Obamacare. 4.2 million have signed up. \"If we had a big neon sign over Healthcare.gov it would be minus-1.8 million now enrolled. That's hardly a success story.\"Cavuto decided to have fun with what he admitted was a serious subject, creating a March Madness-type bracket to determine the \"Not-So-Sweet-16\" reasons people aren't signing up.\"Cost\" beat out all other takers including \"Can't keep your plan,\" and \"Limits on coverage.\"","145":"(Adds quotes in paragraphs 3 and 10, background and details)\n\nBy David Morgan\n\nWASHINGTON, March 17 More than 5 million people have enrolled in private health insurance under the law known as Obamacare since open enrollment began on Oct. 1, the U.S. administration said on Monday.\n\nWith the March 31 enrollment deadline only two weeks away, a top administration official reported a big upswing in public interest in subsidized health insurance and said traffic on the federal website HealthCare.gov reached 1 million visitors over the weekend.\n\n\"The last several days have been the busiest since December,\" Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a government blog posting that announced the new total.\n\nThe 5 million enrollee total marked an increase of at least 800,000 people since March 1, indicating that total enrollment could approach the 6 million figure estimated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office if enrollment surges in the final weeks as administration officials have predicted.\n\nCBO initially forecast 7 million enrollees in private health coverage but scaled back its estimate after technical problems with the rollout that continue to afflict Obamacare insurance marketplaces operated by several states.\n\nMonday's release did not say how many new enrollees are adults aged 18-34, a younger demographic whose participation is seen as essential for the success of President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement.\n\nBefore the rollout, administration officials said their goal was for 38 percent of the new online private insurance marketplaces to consist of younger consumers, who compensate for older, sicker enrollees because they tend to be healthy and cheaper to ensure. But the data so far shows young adults accounting for only one-quarter of enrollees.\n\nAnother important section consists of people signing up for insurance for the first time, a group that also tends to be healthy. The administration says it has no data for that group but the consulting firm McKinsey & Co put the number at around 27 percent of the total enrollees in a report this month.\n\nToo few healthy beneficiaries could cause healthcare costs to rise as insurers grapple with higher insurance risks posed by policyholders who are sick or older.\n\n\"Five million is only a good number if it's mostly people who didn't have insurance before,\" said Joe Antos of the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is expected to extend health insurance to millions of uninsured Americans through the private marketplaces and an expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor.\n\nBut the 2010 law's implementation has been dogged by delays, legal challenges and political attacks from Republicans and other critics.\n\nU.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told Congress last week that the administration will not extend the March 31 enrollment deadline.\n\nBut the law allows people who have difficulty signing up for coverage to arrange for special enrollment periods. And with huge volumes expected in the final days of the open enrollment period, analysts say 2014 enrollment may not reach its final total until sometime after March. (Editing by Chris Reese and Mohammad Zargham)","146":"Some 5 million Americans have signed up for health coverage on the new insurance exchanges so far, the Obama administration said Monday.\n\nThough enrollment has surged by about 800,000 since the end of February, the administration\u2019s latest figure is not a clear estimate of how many people have actually gained coverage through the exchanges since it doesn\u2019t include who has paid for their plans.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Enrollment Slows Ahead of Deadline\n\nLast week, Politico reported that four of the country\u2019s largest insurance companies said about 20 percent of people who signed up for Obamacare had not paid their first months premiums\u2014meaning they should not be counted in the total enrollment numbers.\n\nIf this is correct, actual enrollment would be around 4 million, or 3 million shy of the White House\u2019s original goal of signing up 7 million people this year.\n\nThe latest figures come two weeks before the March 31 deadline to sign up for health coverage through the exchanges. Under the law\u2019s individual mandate, Americans who don\u2019t have health insurance by April 1 will be subject to a penalty of 1 percent of their annual income, unless they apply for a hardship exemption.\n\nPeople can qualify for the exemption if they are experiencing a financial hardship that could make it difficult to obtain health coverage. The administration announced an extension of the exemption through 2016 last week. Critics say it could make it easier for people to skirt around the new requirement, and it can also make people less likely to get coverage.\n\nRelated: Why There May Be a New Obamacare Delay\n\nThough they are still far from reaching their enrollment projections, administration officials are touting the numbers as a success, and say they are confident that sign ups will continue to surge ahead of the open enrollment deadline.\n\n\"The last several days have been the busiest since December, with the Call Center taking more than 198,000 calls on Thursday alone -- the busiest day since December 23 -- and more than 130,000 calls over the weekend,\u201d Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator Marilyn Tavenner said in a blog published Monday.\n\nRelated: 10 Top Questions Consumers Ask About Obamacare\n\nAnother important question the figures do not answer is how many of the new enrollees previously lacked health coverage. This is important since a key goal of the healthcare reform law was to extend access to coverage for the millions of uninsured Americans. One independent study by McKinsey found that just 27 percent of total enrollment through February were previously uninsured.\n\nIf this is accurate, the majority of people signing up for Obamacare either had an employer plan previously and were kicked off, or they found a better deal on the exchanges.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:","147":"You are the owner of this article.","148":"Be the first to know about new stories from PowerPost.

What's more, to save money, most buyers are choosing the lowest level of coverage, the so-called \"bronze\" plans.\n\nThe firm provided the costs to Secrets through their new online price index, which gives the averages of what people are paying for insurance sold through their system.

That's because the average age is 36, older than the administration had hoped for.\n\nExplaining the higher costs, Mast said, \"There are likely other factors, but what is important is that moving forward, there needs to be a collective effort to enroll as many people as possible and create a broad and diverse risk pool to keep premiums in check. eHealth can help in that effort by enrolling consumers off-exchange and is pushing to be able to enroll people in subsidy-eligible plans as well.\"\n\nThere is a hint of good news, though, in firm's the price index. While the current costs for insurance are higher than before Obamacare, they have come down over the past several months.\n\nBelow is a cost summary provided by eHealthInsurance:\n\n\u2014 Premiums have increased by 39 percent to 56 percent, compared to pre-Obamacare coverage. As of Feb. 24, the average premium for an individual health plan selected through eHealth without a subsidy was $274 per month, a 39 percent increase over the average individual premium for pre-Obamacare coverage.\n\n\u2014 The most recent average premium for plans without a subsidy chosen by families was $663 per month, a 56 percent increase over the average family premium in Feb. 2013, which was $426 per month.\n\n\u2014 For both individual and family applicants, bronze plans have been the most popular plan type chosen since the beginning of open enrollment.","150":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. administration said on Monday that more than 5 million people have now enrolled in private health insurance under the program known as Obamacare, since open enrollment began on October 1.\n\nThe tally is an increase of at least 800,000 enrollees since March 1, with volume rising as the six-month enrollment period approaches its deadline on March 31. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that enrollment could total 6 million, but private estimates have suggested a lower turnout.\n\nThe announcement, in a government blog posted by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Marilyn Tavenner, did not say how many new enrollees are the younger adults that President Barack Obamaneeds to make his new health insurance marketplaces a success.\n\nBut Tavenner said the pace of enrollment has been at its highest since late December, when there was a rush of interest from people who wanted coverage beginning January 1.\n\nShe said the federal website HealthCare.gov had 1 million online visitors over the weekend and more than 4 million visitors last week. A federal call center set up to take applications over the telephone had more than 198,000 calls last Thursday.\n\n(Reporting by David Morgan; Editing by Chris Reese)","151":"The Obama administration announced Monday that more than 5 million people have signed up for new insurance plans under the health-care law, suggesting new momentum as the March 31 deadline for coverage this year approaches.\n\nAbout 800,000 people have selected health plans on the state and federal insurance marketplaces this month, officials said in a blog post \u2014 almost as many as signed up during all of February. The figure brings the administration closer to Congressional Budget Office projections that 6 million people would enroll by the end of March.\n\nOfficials had predicted that the pace of enrollments would pick up this month, because March 31 is the last day to sign up for a marketplace plan and avoid a fine. The health law requires most Americans to have health insurance or incur a penalty of $95 or 1 percent of their income this year, whichever is higher.\n\nOfficials have not said how many of those who have enrolled have paid their initial premiums.","152":"House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), seen here in October 2013, joined with Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) to form a 30-member working group to address the health-care law. (Carolyn Kaster\/AP)\n\nHouse Republican leaders are adopting an agreed-upon conservative approach to fixing the nation\u2019s health-care system, in part to draw an election-year contrast with President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe plan includes an expansion of high-risk insurance pools, promotion of health savings accounts and inducements for small businesses to purchase coverage together.\n\nThe tenets of the plan \u2014 which could expand to include the ability to buy insurance across state lines, guaranteed renewability of policies and changes to medical-malpractice regulations \u2014 are ideas that various conservatives have for a long time backed as part of broader bills.\n\nBut this is the first time this year that House leaders will put their full force behind a single set of principles from those bills and present it as their vision. This month, House leaders will begin to share a memo with lawmakers outlining the plan, called \u201cA Stronger Health Care System: The GOP Plan for Freedom, Flexibility, & Peace of Mind,\u201d with suggestions on how Republicans should talk about it to their constituents.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to where you can compare the two perspectives, Republican and Democrat,\u201d House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve got all of these bills out there, so we\u2019re going to take this core of policies and grow from there.\u201d\n\nView Graphic ACA enrollment numbers, state-by-state\n\nRepublicans have campaigned heavily on their opposition to the health-care law in this year\u2019s congressional elections, betting that anger with the law will propel them to gain seats in the House and take control of the Senate. Those efforts accelerated last week after Republican David Jolly\u2019s upset victory in a special House election in Florida in which the campaigns focused on the law.\n\nIn meetings with Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) last week, House leadership allies cast Florida as a sign of good things to come in November. But they also cautioned that Republicans needed to offer a clearer alternative.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be all about giving people a choice,\u201d said Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), an anesthesiologist.\n\nDemocrats dismissed the Republican approach as a purely political gesture ahead of this year\u2019s midterm elections, saying the focus on long-held conservative ideas was more of an attempt to rally Republicans than to find bipartisan solutions.\n\n\u201cIf they had fixes, I\u2019d certainly consider it,\u201d Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (D-Va.) said. \u201cBut if they are trying to scrap it all, going back to the bad old days, it\u2019s not going to go anywhere.\u201d\n\nA CNN-ORC International survey released Tuesday showed support for the Affordable Care Act ticking up slightly, with 39 percent of Americans saying they support the health-care law, an increase from 35 percent in December. Fifty-seven percent of those polled oppose the law, down from 62 percent in December.\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 plan is hardly intended as a full replacement of the federal health-care law \u2014 and that is by design. They would prefer to see a shift away from the federal government and to the states, with an emphasis on getting more consumers on private plans.\n\nAs they finalize their alternative, House Republicans are continuing their years-long effort to take a legislative hammer to the law, passing a bill Friday that would delay the individual mandate and repeal Medicare\u2019s sustainable-growth rate.\n\nFor the most part, House Democrats are not taking the bait. Outside the House chamber Thursday, Rep. Ron Barber (Ariz.), a Tucson area Democrat facing a difficult reelection race, said that he would like to \u201cmake some amendments and adjustments\u201d to the health-care law but added that \u201cthe bill is the law and not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nAt a news conference Thursday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) said Democrats would not run away from the law and shrugged off talk that Florida could be a harbinger of looming Democratic losses in the House and Senate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of our House Democrats and how they have not only embraced the Affordable Care Act, because they helped create it, but how proud they are of it,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the Republicans are wasting their time using that as their electoral issue, and they will find that out.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy, along with Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.), the fourth-ranking Republican in the House, formed a 30-member working group, dubbed the House Obamacare Accountability Project, in May, vetting suggestions over long lunches and reporting back to House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.). The group has met once every two weeks, usually in McCarthy\u2019s spacious Capitol suite.\n\n\u201cThe first priority was establishing trust, and then we moved forward,\u201d McMorris Rodgers said. \u201cWe\u2019ve touched every part of the philosophical range.\u201d\n\nThe policies on the group\u2019s radar have a conservative streak, and the academics and analysts consulted during early deliberations were largely drawn from conservative think tanks, with talks by James Capretta, a former official in the George W. Bush administration; Avik Roy, a writer for National Review; and Dennis Smith, a former adviser to Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R).\n\nConservative leaders in the House, such as Rep. Tom Price (Ga.), a physician from the Atlanta suburbs, and Rep. Steve Scalise (La.), chairman of the Republican Study Committee, have also played critical roles. Their involvement has enabled the leadership to avoid complaints from the right flank \u2014 and ensured that Republicans would not veer from conservative doctrine.\n\nBut some conservatives are wary of the push to have House Republicans sing as a unified chorus. At Wednesday\u2019s Weyrich Lunch on Capitol Hill, a gathering of hard-right operatives named after the late conservative strategist Paul Weyrich, there was much skepticism about the leadership\u2019s strategy, with conservatives urging their allies to be cautious.\n\nMcMorris Rodgers, who gave the party\u2019s official response to Obama\u2019s State of the Union address in January, played down tensions, saying the early outline is a blend of four previous GOP bills: a replacement plan produced by the Republican Study Committee, a bill authored by Price, a Senate Republican proposal, and the House GOP\u2019s 2009 alternative to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNext month, when the House breaks for its April recess, McMorris Rodgers will provide members with a PowerPoint presentation on the GOP plan and will later hold sessions to collect feedback on how the recommendations went over at town hall meetings. Publicizing stories of people who have seen premium increases is a priority.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to say, \u2018I told you so,\u2019 \u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThe country has changed since Obamacare has come in \u2014 we understand that. But we\u2019re going to offer specific ideas, making the big-picture case and on the micro level.\u201d\n\nA complete health-care overhaul remains the GOP\u2019s overarching goal. GOP leaders, however, are open to adopting conservative versions of elements of the law. Regarding people with preexisting conditions, for instance, they point to the high-risk insurance pools, which would be managed and subsidized by states. On allowing children to stay on their parents\u2019 health insurance plans until age 26, they said Republicans may back that policy.\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Republicans are closely watching the House GOP\u2019s activity. This year, Sens. Tom Coburn (Okla.), Orrin G. Hatch (Utah) and Richard Burr (N.C.) proposed their own alternative, which they suggested could be the basis for the party-wide pitch on health care.\n\n\u201cThere are only so many answers \u2014 that\u2019s the thing,\u201d Coburn said. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the politics of it. I want to solve the problem. Eventually we\u2019re going to have to roll up our sleeves and have some kind of combined message.\u201d","153":"With two weeks left to register, officials said Monday that Obamacare signups now have hit the 5 million mark, perhaps putting enrollment goals within reach.\n\nGetty Images\n\nMarilyn Tavenner, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, noted the milestone on her blog Monday. Tavenner said the 5 million mark was reached over the weekend, a little less than three weeks after CMS officials announced on Feb. 25 they had reached 4 million enrollees. That February mark was reached slightly more than one month after enrollment hit 3 million on Jan. 24.\n\nWith the March 31 deadline to enlist in Obamacare, the pace of enrollment clearly is quickening, putting new expectations of 6 million signups now in sight for the Affordable Care Act through public exchanges. The 6 million goal was lowered by the Congressional Budget Office from 7 million after difficulties with HealthCare.gov prompted researchers to rethink the numbers.\n\nA brisk campaign waged by President Obama along with members of his administration hopes to boost enrollment via either a handful of state-run exchanges or the federal HealthCare.gov site. Obama himself has made some unusual appearance in hopes of getting young adults to sign up.\n\nThe president last week showed up on the website \u201cFunny or Die\u201d with Zach Galifianakis and traded a few barbs with the comic actor as he plugged his signature legislative achievement.

The divide is more equitable than before the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as California\u2019s insurance market is now \u201cmoderately concentrated\u201d instead of \u201chighly concentrated,\u201d according to a measure of market share called the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, said researchers at Kaiser, a Menlo Park, California-based nonprofit that focuses on health care.\n\n\u201cThere are some examples of smaller or newer plans being able to get a sizable piece of the market in the exchanges, but by and large a lot of the players in the exchanges that are the biggest were the biggest before as well,\u201d Cynthia Cox, a senior analyst at Kaiser, said in a phone interview.\n\nAbout 5 million Americans have signed up for private health plans through today using the law\u2019s insurance exchanges, according to the U.S. government. The exchanges were intended to ease access and improve transparency for people who shop for insurance on their own, about 5 percent of the U.S. population. Democrats who wrote the law also hoped to break the dominance of some companies that existed in many states.\n\nIn California, WellPoint Inc.\u2019s Anthem brand signed up about 30 percent of the 869,000 people who used the state\u2019s health exchange, Covered California, by March 1. Anthem had 47 percent of the state\u2019s market before plans started to be sold on the new health exchanges on Oct. 1.\n\nState Changes\n\nWellPoint also lost ground in New York and Nevada, where it fell from 28 percent and 34 percent of the market, respectively, to 18 percent and 12 percent. In Connecticut, WellPoint\u2019s plans now hold 60 percent of the market from 45 percent before major provisions of the law known as Obamacare took effect.\n\nKristin Binns, a WellPoint spokeswoman, cautioned against drawing conclusions from the Kaiser data, which exclude customers whose plans were renewed from prior years and people who signed up without using exchanges.\n\nBefore the health-care law, one insurance company held at least half the individual market in 30 states, according to the Kaiser report. That remains true in some states, even after the major provisions of Obamacare took effect this year. In Minnesota, for example, PreferredOne, a closely held company based in Golden Valley, Minnesota, has taken about 59 percent of customers on the state\u2019s exchange, MNsure.\n\nBefore the health law, the state\u2019s Blue Cross Blue Shield plan had 59 percent of the market, while PreferredOne had 3 percent. Blue Cross Blue Shield now has 24 percent share.\n\nThe Kaiser report said that PreferredOne took share by offering \u201csome of the lowest exchange premiums in the country\u201d for plans with very narrow networks of hospitals and doctors.","155":"Sorry, this page is temporarily unavailable\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.

Meaning that with two weeks until a key deadline, the administration is still a million enrollees short of its most recent goal.\n\nOr, put another way: about 48.73 people need to enroll in an Obamacare exchange every minute until April 1 to hit the baseline of 6 million set by the Congressional Budget Office last month.\n\nIf you look at the graph of enrollments over time, below, you can see that without a dramatic spike in enrollments, that won't happen. Many people expected the pace of enrollments to pick up as the April 1 deadline approached; if it has picked up much, it has been a subtle increase. (Each dot below marks an announced update from HHS. The x-axis is to scale.)\n\n\n\nThe 6 million figure is admittedly arbitrary. The April 1 date by which the White House wanted to hit that number marks three months into the year, the point at which Americans who have not been insured at all in 2014 face the individual mandate penalty. The CBO derived its 6 million estimate from enrollment trends so that it could evaluate the extent to which the program would work economically. That's a point that President Obama last week said had already been met. In other words, even without hitting the 6 million enrollment mark, Obama feels (publicly) confident that there are enough enrollees to make the system viable.\n\nThere's a bit of good news here for MSNBC's Ed Schultz, too. Last December, Schultz loudly proclaimed that there would be 5 million enrollees by March 1. When that didn't happen, he declined to point out his mistake. As it turns out, he was only off by 16 days.","157":"House Republicans are finally putting their weight behind a single Obamacare alternative plan. It looks really familiar \u2014 and voters in close Congressional districts will soon hear a lot about it.\n\nThis article is from the archive of our partner . House Republicans are finally putting their weight behind a single Obamacare alternative plan, according to The Washington Post. It looks really familiar \u2014 and voters in close Congressional districts will soon hear a lot about it. Like the several plans hinted at and pitched before it, this one features conservative-friendly ideas on high-risk insurance pools, insurance sales across state lines and medical-malpractice regulations. And like all those past plans there are a lot of policies that would lead to reduced protections for consumers, especially those with pre-existing conditions. This plan likely won't see the light of day until after the midterm elections (and then it will be killed by the Senate or President Obama). \"Republican sources\" say that House Majority Leader Eric Cantor hopes to at least create a plan to campaign on, according to The Washington Examiner, for reasons we explained earlier. But, to get a sense of what Republicans mean when they say healthcare reform, here's a breakdown of the key concepts that will definitely and possibly be included.\n\nDefinitely Included Expansion of high-risk insurance pools: These are insurance pools that only include people with pre-existing conditions, the sort of people who couldn't get insurance before Obamacare. There are three problems with high-risk insurance pools: they are expensive to fund, they are expensive to participate in, and they don't include all high-risk patients. The Incidental Economist found back in 2009 that high-risk pools, which were active in 35 states, only accommodated up to 54 percent of possible individuals within a state, and sometimes only one percent. Premiums were often 25 percent of a person's income. States found that they couldn't afford to subsidize more of the premiums, or expand the program so more people could enroll. Healthy people would benefit if the sickest patients were no longer in their insurance pool, since rates could be lower. Those less healthy individuals would be competing for spots in the high-risk pools. Promotion of health savings accounts: Health savings accounts allow you to deposit pre-tax funds into a savings account towards qualifying medical costs if you have a high deductible plan. Obamacare makes the accounts slightly less necessary by capping out-of-pocket costs. It also prohibits the use of HSA funds to buy over the counter drugs (without a prescription) and raises the withdrawal fee from 10 to 20 percent. When President Bush started promoting the accounts in 2006, Mother Jones described the pros and cons. \"Many health care analysts fear that widespread acceptance of HSAs will separate the wealthy and healthy from the sick in insurance pools,\" they wrote, \"and drive up premiums and out-of-pocket health costs for the latter.\" It's not clear whether that happened, but HSAs grew in popularity between 2007 and 2013 (from five percent to 20 percent of workers) as employers tried to cut down on healthcare costs. The plans definitely benefit wealthy individuals over low income individuals, who can't use the tax benefits or afford high deductibles as easily.","158":"About this blog The world we live in influences our health in some weird ways.

Originally, the White House aimed for 38 percent of all sign-ups to be between the ages of 18 and 35.\n\nPresident Obama has made direct appeals to younger people of late, including appearances on comedy shows and programs aimed at sports fans.\n\nThe administration still has not announced what percentage of sign-ups have actually paid their first month\u2019s premium and the ratio of those who were previously uninsured.","165":"An important healthcare deadline is fast approaching, but many Americans appear to be either unconcerned or in the dark about how that deadline can and will affect them.\n\nOpen enrollment in the Affordable Care Act (ACA), aka Obamacare, ends March 31. And people who haven't signed up for heath coverage by then might face a financial penalty. But according to a new survey by Bankrate (NYSE: RATE), about one-third of uninsured Americans say they'll remain uninsured.\n\nThe poll, a telephone survey of more than 3,000 Americans, found 34 percent of respondents plan to continue without health coverage. When asked why, 41 percent of those polled said health insurance was too expensive \u2013 while 17 percent said they opposed Obamacare and another 13 percent said they were healthy and didn't need such coverage.\n\n56 percent of the uninsured people surveyed said the did plan to get health coverage under ACA. But 70 percent of those polled didn't know about subsidies available to them, to reduce the cost of health insurance.\n\n\u201cThis is a staggeringly high percentage,\u201d Bankrate.com insurance analyst Doug Whiteman said in a press statement. \u201cThe government has spent over half a billion dollars promoting the Affordable Care Act and more than two-thirds of uninsured Americans still don\u2019t know about the subsidies. Plus, fewer than half (48%) know that the enrollment deadline is in two weeks.\u201d\n\nSabrina Corlette, research professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute, believes the Obama Administration's campaign has focused too much on the benefits of the ACA, rather than any punitive tax penalties.\n\n\"They found in Massachusetts, with 'RomneyCare' that the individual mandate penalty absolutely motivated a lot of people to purchase insurance,\" she Corlette told Bankrate.com. \"The Obama Administration understandably tried to emphasize the positive, but people need to understand that the mandate is not insignificant -- they could be hit with a big tax bill if they don't buy coverage.\"\n\nRelated Links\n\n\u00a9 2014 Benzinga.com.

Seems that he noticed, some days back, that there were 46 million people in these United States who were uninsured. In 2009, researchers at the Harvard Medical School found that 45,000 people a year died because they lacked insurance, so it's nice that Curl finally noticed this! However, as it turns out, he saw another big number in the news more recently, and now he can haz confusion. Per Curl:\n\nBut last week came word that with just 15 days left for people to enroll for federal coverage, just 4.2 million had. The math is simple: That\u2019s just 9 percent of the supposedly 46 million uninsured.\n\n(Just a quick aside here: If \"the word\" on the 4.2 million enrollees arrived last Tuesday, that would have meant there were 20 days left to enroll. Also, that 4.2 million figure is the total from the first of March, so there were actually 30 whole days in which to increase enrollment. I know ... details.)\n\n\u201cIt will be a larger number than that by the end of March,\u201d Mr. Obama promised in an interview with WebMD. \u201cAt this point, enough people are signing up that the Affordable Care Act is going to work.\u201d Still, the obvious question is: We changed the $2.7 trillion health care system to sign up 4.2 million people?\n\nThe obvious answer is: No, calm down, that's not what we did. I'm actually just as concerned about who gets left on the outside-looking-in as far as being uninsured in the Obamacare era. Actually, I'm clearly more concerned, because I prefer to get this stuff right.\n\nIn the first place, that \"46 million people are uninsured\" number? That's an estimate according to the Census Bureau. According to the Congressional Budget Office's February 2014 baseline covering the \"Insurance Coverage Provisions of the Affordable Care Act,\" there were actually 57 million non-elderly uninsured people in the marketplace under prior law. These are both perfectly legitimate estimates, but since I'll be referring to CBO projections, I figure we'll use its higher number.\n\nSecondly, that 4.2 million figure? That refers to \"people who will enroll in the exchanges,\" not \"people who will suddenly have health insurance and come off the rolls of the uninsured.\" Those who do participate in the exchanges aren't really participating in some radically altered \"$2.7 trillion health care system.\" They're purchasing health insurance from the same old insurance companies from whom people have always purchased insurance -- albeit in a more just and equitable marketplace, with stronger regulations governing the types of policies they can purchase.\n\nNow, that 4.2 million figure is much lower than the administration wants it to be. It is their hope that at some point this year, it will be much higher. From time to time, the administration has suggested that their end-of-March benchmark for success was 7 million exchange enrollees, and at other times, they've walked that back. Now, the administration is holding 6 million enrollees out as their goal, but it's fair to say that 7 million is the number the administration would like to hit if they had their druthers. In any event, the bottom line is that you can blame that disastrous first month the exchanges were open for depressing the enrollment, so the administration definitely owns any shortfall in the numbers.\n\nNevertheless, these figures also don't count people who buy direct from a health insurance company, even though almost all of those people are buying ACA-compliant plans. And anyone not in a \"grandfathered\" plan or one of those extended not-yet-canceled plans is in the same risk pool as the exchange enrollees. So when all is said and done, we're going to have a lot more people in ACA-compliant plans (i.e., the new market for individual insurance, broadly speaking) than the number of people who actually use an exchange to buy insurance.\n\nOf course, with all this nitpicking over 6 million here and 7 million there ... that's still such a small number when we're talking about the uninsured population. Ahh, but remember: The health insurance exchanges aren't the only way the Affordable Care Act is supposed to reduce the ranks of the uninsured. Furthermore, no one ever promised that substantial reductions in the large number of uninsured were going to happen quite so rapidly. Check out the CBO's projections:\n\nOne of the things Curl is forgetting is that the Affordable Care Act is also reducing the ranks of the uninsured by expanding Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. In fact, in the fully implemented law's first two years, the expansion of these programs is projected to have at least as significant an impact on reducing the pool of uninsured Americans as the exchanges themselves. By the time we get to 2016, however, the total number of uninsured drops by 25 million. As a percentage of the U.S. population, the law is projected to insure 89 percent of the population by 2017; 92 percent if you exclude \"unauthorized immigrants\" from the total U.S. population denominator. (There's not a lot of support for expanding Obamacare benefits to that population, anyway.)\n\nThere's also a hard-to-track number of people who are currently insured by dint of a rule that allows younger Americans to remain on their parents' insurance policies until they are 26 years old. Because it's hard to track, it's easy to tout a rosier number. I think that The Washington Post's Glenn Kessler has done the best spadework on this and provides the most conservative estimate:\n\nFirst, an estimated 3.1 million Americans younger than 26 joined their parents\u2019 plans because of a provision that took effect in September 2010. One big caveat about that Health and Human Services Department estimate is that it is about two years old -- and has never been updated. The Fact Checker dug into the more recent reports and found that it was based on a single quarterly figure that was not sustained in later quarters. (That might be why the report was never updated.) However, the overall increase in the percentage of insured young adults suggests a gain of about 2.8 million from the third quarter of 2010 to the first half of 2013. Given quarterly fluctuations, a more conservative approach would be to use the average figure for 2010 as the base; that would reduce the increase to 2.2 million people. That is still substantial.\n\nFinally, via Gallup, here's an overview of what's been happening to the uninsured population in recent months:\n\nThe percentage of Americans without health insurance continues to fall, measuring 15.9% so far in 2014 compared with 17.1% in the fourth quarter of 2013. ... The uninsured rate has been declining since the fourth quarter of 2013, after hitting an all-time high of 18.0% in the third quarter. The uninsured rate for the first quarter of 2014 so far includes a 16.2% reading for January and 15.6% for February. The uninsured rate for almost every major demographic group has dropped in 2014 so far. The percentage of uninsured Americans with an annual household income of less than $36,000 has dropped the most -- by 2.8 percentage points -- to 27.9% since the fourth quarter of 2013, while the percentage of uninsured blacks has fallen 2.6 points to 18.3%. Hispanics remain the subgroup most likely to lack health insurance, with an uninsured rate of 37.9%. The percentage of uninsured has declined across all age groups this year, except for those aged 65 and older. The uninsured rate for that group has likely remained stable because most Americans aged 65 and older have Medicare. The uninsured rate among 26- to 34-year-olds and 35- to 64-year-olds continues to decline -- now at 26.6% and 16.3%, respectively.\n\nWhich is pretty good, all told. But it still leaves a lot of people uninsured. Thanks to a study conducted by the Urban Institute at Wake Forest University, we know something about who these people are: Some of those people reside in states not expanding Medicaid, some are undocumented immigrants (who aren't even allowed to use the exchanges to buy insurance with their own money), and others -- perhaps the people the Obama administration should be most concerned about -- still find insurance unaffordable even with the subsidies that are available through the exchanges.\n\nWhat's to be done to help that still substantial population? That's actually a much better question than \"We changed the $2.7 trillion health care system to sign up 4.2 million people?\" But then, that's the sort of thing you ask when your concern for the uninsured population of the United States didn't begin yesterday. Because one of the answers is that a number of people who would get coverage through expanded Medicaid aren't getting it because their governors hate both Obamacare and their own constituents.\n\n[Would you like to follow me on Twitter?

Here it is, with the big picture at the end:\n\nThe takeaway is that despite its fits and starts, the ACA is the law of the land. Meanwhile, most Republicans are still stuck in fall 2009 or at best fall 2010, and appear to reject new information about what the law actually is doing. That doesn't matter for electoral politics, most likely. But it does make Republicans ill-equipped to govern on this issue -- at least, if governing entails more than symbolic gestures.\n\n\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg View's editorial board or Bloomberg LP, its owners and investors.\n\n(Jonathan Bernstein covers U.S. politics for Bloomberg View.

Yet, despite the drop, federal officials anticipate another surge as the March 31 deadline for enrollment approaches. Those who are not covered by the deadline may face a fine of $95 or 1 percent of their income, whichever is greater.\n\nAccording to The Huffington Post, at the current pace, sign-ups are below the original target of 5.6 million by the end of February, based on the Congressional Budget Office projection of seven million by the end of March. Last month, the budget office downgraded those projections to six million for the full six-month enrollment period, so a big surge would be needed in the final weeks to meet that benchmark.\n\nApproximately 25 percent of enrollments up to March 1 were for individuals in the critical demographic age range of 18 to 34. They are presumed to be healthier and thus less likely to incur costly medical bills than the older people in the market. The White House originally aimed for about 40 percent of the enrollees to be younger than 35 years old.\n\nUncertainty also remains as to how many people have signed up for Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program since open enrollment commenced Oct. 1. According to Tuesday's HHS report, 4.4 million people have signed up for Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program since the beginning of the enrollment period. That number doesn't include anyone who enrolled in the programs directly with state agencies, however.\n\nHHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius pointed to a Gallup survey released Monday that showed the percentage of uninsured individuals decreased from 17.1 to 15.9 percent, the lowest level since 2008, as evidence that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is making a difference. \u201cThis wasn't a coincidence or something that just happened on its own,\u201d Sebelius said. \u201cGiven what we know about past enrollment patterns for healthcare, we expect that even more will sign up as we approach the March 31 deadline.\u201d\n\n\n\nJust over 60 percent of enrollments\u2014or 2.6 million\u2014were processed through the federal exchange. The rest were through the marketplaces run by 14 states and the District of Columbia.","179":"One-third of uninsured Americans plan to remain uninsured, despite the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that they obtain health insurance or pay a fine, according to a new Bankrate.com report.\n\nThe research reveals that 70 percent of uninsured Americans don\u2019t know about the subsidies available to reduce the cost of health insurance.","180":"ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSALISBURY, Md. -- If you're wondering why the Obama administration is still so far from its goal of enrolling 6 million Americans into Obamacare, look no further than Maryland's Lower Eastern Shore.\n\nThe area is home to Ocean City, a local beach getaway. But beyond the sand, the three counties that make up the Lower Eastern Shore -- Somerset, Wicomico and Worcester -- also are known as some of the poorest areas in Maryland, with high rates of poverty, unemployment and uninsurance. In 2011, about 20,000 of the counties' 178,000 residents lacked health insurance, according to the most recent census data. That 14 percent rate was the fourth-worst in Maryland that year, and above the 2011 statewide uninsurance rate of 12 percent.\n\nIt is now up to a team of just 15 county health workers to get those people covered under the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's signature health care reform law.\n\nConvincing this poor, Republican-leaning population -- the area elected the state's only GOP member of the House and voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 -- to sign up for health insurance under Obamacare is painstaking work done at the individual level. A health worker must sit down with someone and guide them through the process -- that is, if they can find the uninsured.\n\n\"The uninsured are really hard to pinpoint. I mean, they're working families and individuals, and we have so many people who are self-employed, under-employed, contractors, farmers, watermen, service-sector Ocean City resort employees, small-business employees,\" said Katherine Gunby, the coordinator for the outreach program here.\n\n\"It's just a matter of making it clear to them that most of them are eligible for some type of assistance, and this is how they can get help signing up,\" Gunby, a 30-year-old from Salisbury, said.\n\nOn a recent Saturday, Gunby and her team from the Lower Shore Health Insurance Assistance Program set up shop in a local arena for one of the largest Obamacare enrollment events the area had yet seen.\n\nStickers at the event in Maryland.\n\nGunby's small crew, which operates out of the Worcester County Health Department with state funds of about $1.2 million, is responsible for spreading the word about the availability of the Affordable Care Act's two main components: subsidized private health insurance and Medicaid, a health benefit that's been expanded to include more poor Americans in half of the states, including Maryland. They have a huge swath of the state to cover -- three counties spread across 1,100 square miles.\n\nThe Maryland-run Obamacare website is making Gunby's job harder. The Maryland Health Connection has proved one of the worst health insurance exchanges in the nation thanks to its unreliable website and overwhelmed call center.\n\nAt the March 8 enrollment event, Gunby, her team of 10 Obamacare \"connectors,\" and four health insurance brokers were joined by two information technology technicians from the state, who were on hand to deal with website issues. Carolyn Quattrocki, the interim director of Maryland's troubled exchange, also attended to oversee the event in person.\n\nDuring the five-hour event, people streamed into the Wicomico Youth & Civic Center in Salisbury to sign up for health insurance. Some waited more than a half-hour to be seen and more than an hour to get through their applications, seeking help applying for private insurance or Medicaid.\n\nAttendees interviewed by The Huffington Post left happy. Amanda Weaver, a 33-year-old self-employed wedding photographer from Salisbury, signed up her family for coverage that's cheaper and more comprehensive than the plan she gave up in November when she left Starbucks, where she worked for the health benefits, to focus on growing a business. Lamont Morton, a 27-year-old from Fruitland who'd been unemployed and uninsured for three years after being laid off by Coca-Cola, left the civic center enrolled in a Medicaid plan from a private insurer.\n\n\"We finally got a plan,\" said Sheila Fisher, a two-time cancer survivor from Westover who had been unable to afford health insurance before Obamacare's passage prohibited health insurers from charging astronomical rates to those with \"pre-existing conditions.\" For $271 a month including tax credits that cut the cost, Sheila and her husband, Samuel, got a low-level \"bronze\" plan plus dental coverage. The couple had been uninsured for three years.\n\nSamuel and Sheila Fisher of Westover, Md., enrolled in a health plan at a Lower Shore Health Insurance Assistance Program event in Salisbury, Md., on March 8.\n\n\"We've seen just what can happen when you run up hospital bills and you own property,\" said Samuel Fisher, who works three hours away in a Washington, D.C., restaurant. Medical debts left after the death of Shelia Fisher's mother last year have been an issue for their family, he said.\n\nThe Fishers tried to sign up online and over the phone, but Maryland Health Connection failed them, he said. Technical problems with their application kept them at the civic center for more than an hour and half.\n\nAs is well-known, technological glitches have hampered both HealthCare.gov, the online portal to the health care exchanges in 36 states, and state-run marketplaces in locations like Oregon, Hawaii and Massachusetts. As improvements have rolled out at the federal and state levels, enrollments on the exchanges have continued to mount, topping 4.2 million in February.\n\nNow that the March 31 deadline for private insurance enrollment is nearing and workers are figuring out ways around glitches, the pace of enrollment seems to be speeding up, according to one Lower Shore Health Insurance Assistance Program worker.\n\n\"We've gotten very busy over the last couple of weeks or so, and we're kind of expecting things to stay strong up until the end,\" said Jalissa Worthy, 25, of Salisbury.\n\nSo-called connectors like Worthy travel the surrounding counties each day spreading the word about how to sign up for health coverage. The 15 workers on Gunby's team typically visit a total of 30 locations every day, she said. That includes many events held across the area every week at county health departments, libraries, pharmacies, religious institutions, community health centers and other gathering places.\n\n\"We're 100 percent mobile. On my busiest day, I move between three locations,\" Worthy said.\n\nWorthy grew up on the Lower Eastern Shore and understands that the need is great. \"I remember as a kid, lots of family members and lots of people in my local community who did work out on the water or who did work in the crab houses and the seafood places. And over the years, those have kind of dwindled down to nothing,\" she said.\n\nLamont Morton, who signed up for insurance at the March event in Maryland.\n\nOther local industries have also shed jobs over the last decade or two, said Sue Gray, the CEO of Three Lower Counties Community Services in Salisbury, which operates community health centers in the area. \"I've lived here 30 years, and we lost a lot of industry. Since we moved here, we lost Campbell's Soup, we lost Crown Cork and Seal, we lost Wayne Pumps,\" said Gray, a nurse by training.\n\nPoultry conglomerates like Perdue Farms and Tyson Foods still provide a lot of jobs in the area, but not enough to go around. When jobs go, often so does access to affordable health insurance.\n\nUnemployment, poverty and a lack of insurance aren't the only reasons why many people in this area need assistance with their health care, Gray said. \"We have, as you could imagine, a large amount of people with comorbid conditions, where they are diabetic, hypertensive, overweight, have cardiac diseases,\" she said.\n\nNot that every eligible person on the Lower Eastern Shore is clamoring to enroll. The team has to overcome misconceptions -- like the idea that there aren't any options for insurance, just one big program called \"Obamacare\" that everyone must join, Worthy said.\n\nAnd some people still don't feel like they can afford health insurance even with subsidies, especially those for whom work is unsteady and income hard to predict, Worthy said. Poor people are forced to concentrate on their immediate needs, so committing to a bill they're not sure they can pay every month isn't always the obvious choice, she said.\n\n\"They only thing you can do is present the benefits to people and really try to have an honest conversation with them,\" she said. \"I just try to get them to think of the long-term consequences.\"","181":"Healthcare\n\nThe Washington Post heralds the arrival of the new Republican plan for a post ObamaCare-world:\n\nHouse Republican leaders are adopting an agreed-upon conservative approach to fixing the nation\u2019s health-care system, in part to draw an election-year contrast with President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. The plan includes an expansion of high-risk insurance pools, promotion of health savings accounts and inducements for small businesses to purchase coverage together. The tenets of the plan \u2014 which could expand to include the ability to buy insurance across state lines, guaranteed renewability of policies and changes to medical-malpractice regulations \u2014 are ideas that various conservatives have for a long time backed as part of broader bills. But this is the first time this year that House leaders will put their full force behind a single set of principles from those bills and present it as their vision. This month, House leaders will begin to share a memo with lawmakers outlining the plan, called \u201cA Stronger Health Care System: The GOP Plan for Freedom, Flexibility, & Peace of Mind,\u201d with suggestions on how Republicans should talk about it to their constituents. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to where you can compare the two perspectives, Republican and Democrat,\u201d House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve got all of these bills out there, so we\u2019re going to take this core of policies and grow from there.\u201d\n\nThe key phrase here is \u201cthe first time this year.\u201d Republicans have put forth several other alternatives over the past four years, including a few other working-group products that were meant to be the party\u2019s \u201cofficial alternative\u201d to ObamaCare. But the media let Democrats get away with pretending none of these plans existed. One of President Obama\u2019s most frequently repeated, and categorically false, talking points is that nobody has any alternative suggestions to his disastrous Affordable Care Act. In the very same Washington Post article that describes the 2014 Republican alternative, Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) is quoted pretending the new plan doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nSo Republican leaders are basically surfing on the media tide by treating this as the grand unveiling of a brand-new package, even though most of the (quite excellent) ideas they\u2019re teasing have been part of earlier proposals Democrats were able to wish away into the cornfield. This might prove to be an effective bit of political and media judo, because 2014 feels like a brand-new shuffle and cut of the electoral cards, and voters will see the official Republican plan as an entirely fresh and new replacement for the widely hated ACA. (The Post tries to buck up lil\u2019 campers on the Democrat reservation by citing an ostensibly reassuring poll that has \u201csupport for the Affordable Care Act ticking up slightly\u201d\u2026 to 39 percent, with 57 percent disapproval.)\n\nThe new Republican plan will debut amid much buzz about President Obama\u2019s falling approval ratings, public disgust with the endless and nakedly political revisions to the ACA, and the meaning of the special election in Florida\u2019s District 13. The underdog Republican victory in that race might have persuaded the leadership it\u2019s time to bring out a plan they can run with, in unison, during the midterm elections. Until now, it has been thought that exposing a GOP alternative to Democrat attacks could be a tactical mistake, giving Dems a chance to change the subject away from the ongoing ObamaCare disaster. Some conservative strategists evidently still feel that way, but others think it will be difficult to fully capitalize on the public revolt against ObamaCare without a solid alternative on the table.\n\nIf the House package draws wide acclaim once its details are unveiled, the next step will be to get Senate Republicans on board. If the party\u2019s efforts are split between too many conflicting alternatives, their signals will all be lost in media static \u2013 they should have learned that by now. On the other hand, every headline-grabbing ObamaCare horror story gives them another chance to say, \u201cUnder our plan, these things won\u2019t happen,\u201d coupled with frequent reminders of all those broken ObamaCare promises and absurdly inaccurate predictions.\n\nBarack Obama is illegally waiving huge chunks of the Affordable Care Act just to keep his party alive during the 2014 election. That\u2019s a terrific setup for the GOP to come together behind a superior alternative proposal\u2026 a law so good the government might actually obey it.","182":"During testimony last week before the House Ways and Means Committee, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius conceded that health insurance premiums would go up for plans in 2015, though she downplayed the increase by claiming that they would \u201cgo up at a smaller pace than what we\u2019ve seen since 2010.\u201d\n\nThere are varying estimates about how much premiums have gone up over the last several years, but everyone tends to agree that the increased costs are a concern. In fact, President Barack Obama has cited premium increases as part of the larger case for healthcare reform, promising that Obamacare would reduce premiums by $2,500 per year.\n\nBut, to Sebelius\u2019 point, let\u2019s take a look a premium increases, not just since 2010, but going back to 2005 through data provided by eHealthInsurance.com. As you can see in the chart below, the average individual health insurance premium rose by 37% from 2005 to 2013 and by 31% for the average family premium. Keep in mind that these are pre-Obamacare premiums.\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker, folks. eHealth, the nation\u2019s first and largest private exchange, has also released data comparing average February 2013 premiums to unsubsidized plans that were being purchased in February 2014.\n\nAccording to data released last month, the average increase for an individual health plan purchased through the eHealth was 39% compared to 2013, pre-Obamacare coverage and 56% for a family plan.\n\nThe average increase for health plans between 2013 and 2014 surpassed the average increase of the previous eight years combined.\n\nWhy did premiums rise so much? Mark Bertolini, CEO of Aetna, explained the reasons in an October appearance on CNBC, pointing to actuarial benefit requirements in the law, taxes and fees that have been passed on to consumers, and the mandated benefits.\n\n\u201c[A]ll those things add up to an average increase we\u2019ve seen across the United States,\u201d noted Berotlini, \u201cdepending on the market, of anywhere from 30% to 40%, ranging anywhere from low single digits, all the way over 100% increases.\u201d\n\nSebelius can\u2019t really predict that the premiums will \u201cgo up at a smaller pace than what we\u2019ve seen since 2010.\u201d Why? Well, the Department of Health and Human Services can\u2019t tell Congress how many of the 4.2 million people who\u2019ve \u201cselected plans\u201d on the exchanges have actually made a premium payment. Insurers, however, have reported that roughly 20% haven\u2019t made a payment.\n\nAdditionally, it remains to be seen how many young people the administration will sign up for health coverage. Through February, just 25% of those who\u2019d selected plans were between the ages of 18 and 34, far below the 38% to 40% the administration said it needed for the risk pools to be sustainable.\n\nNow, it may be that the bailout provisions, which the administration expects to cost $5.5 billion in the next fiscal year, limit the impact of the increases. But if the administration didn\u2019t expect that premiums would rise by a significant amount, it wouldn\u2019t have delayed the 2015 open enrollment period until after this year\u2019s mid-term election. After all, sticker shock could be electoral poison for Democrats.","183":"I hear that House Republicans have a shiny new health care plan they plan to introduce sometime soon. Before I read past the headlines, let me take a guess at what's in it:\n\nTort reform\n\nHealth savings accounts\n\nInterstate purchase of health plans\n\nHigh-risk pools\n\nOK, now let's take a look. Here is Robert Costa in the Washington Post:\n\nThe plan includes an expansion of high-risk insurance pools, promotion of health savings accounts and inducements for small businesses to purchase coverage together. The tenets of the plan \u2014 which could expand to include the ability to buy insurance across state lines, guaranteed renewability of policies and changes to medical-malpractice regulations \u2014 are ideas that various conservatives have for a long time backed as part of broader bills.\n\nHmmm. It looks like I missed a couple of things: \"inducements\" for small businesses and \"guaranteed renewability\" of policies. Still, I nailed the main points. That's a pretty amazing feat of crystal ball gazing, isn't it?\n\nNo, of course not. It's like predicting that a Republican tax plan will include lower rates on the rich. They might package it in different wrapping paper, but it's always the same old stuff. And it's worth keeping in mind that guaranteed renewability of policies has been the law for a long time, so it's unlikely the GOP plan actually offers anything substantive on that point. Ditto for the small business \"inducements,\" which will probably just turn out to be tax cuts of some kind.\n\nBasically, Republican health care proposals are always, always, always a repackaging of the four tired old points above. Nobody seriously thinks that any of them will expand access to health care in any serious way, but that doesn't matter. These are the only things Republicans can all agree on, so that's what they always propose. Whether it works or not isn't really the point.\n\nIf you want more detail about all this, rather than just my exasperated Cliff Notes version, check out Jonathan Cohn here. He has it all covered.","184":"One of the goals of the Affordable Care Act is to create more competitive markets for individual health policies. The number of people who bought private health plans on their own was relatively small before Obamacare, and in many areas buyers had very few insurers to choose among. The evidence so far shows more competitive markets lead to lower premiums for consumers. The new Obamacare exchange marketplaces, where people with modest incomes can get subsidies to buy coverage, are intended to draw more insurers and give consumers more choices. So are they more competitive than the old markets?\n\nA new report from the Kaiser Family Foundation says the answer is yes in some states, including New York and California, while in others the experience has been the opposite. Seven states so far have published enrollment data that show which insurance companies people selected, and Kaiser analyzed this data to see whether the new marketplaces were more concentrated, or less, than they were before.\n\nAn important caveat: Kaiser looks only at competition on the exchanges. Insurers are selling private health plans off the exchanges as well (although consumers can\u2019t use subsidies to purchase them), so the numbers aren\u2019t a complete reflection of the individual market in each state. Still, here\u2019s what researchers found:\n\n\u2022 New York and California, the largest states that have released detailed enrollment data, saw more competitive markets. California\u2019s WellPoint plans, which include Anthem Blue Cross, had 47 percent of the market for private health plans in 2012, a share that dropped to 30 percent in the exchange marketplace. Also, more companies are offering individual coverage in the state. New York had a thoroughly broken market for individual insurance before Obamacare, because insurers had to sell coverage to everyone, regardless of how sick they were, but there was no mandate for healthy people to buy coverage. That led to sky-high premiums and little incentive for new companies to enter the market. WellPoint (parent of Empire BlueCross BlueShield) was the biggest of these, with 28 percent of the market in 2012. That has dropped to 18 percent on the exchange this year. Seven insurers now hold at least 5 percent of the market, compared with five companies before.\n\nThe most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. \u2022 Connecticut and Washington state had the opposite experience, with new exchanges that are less competitive than the old markets. In Connecticut, large insurers, including Aetna and UnitedHealthcare, are staying out of the exchange marketplace. Just three companies are offering plans on the exchange, and WellPoint has 60 percent of the market. EmblemHealth has 37 percent, leaving the third insurer, HealthyCT, just 3 percent. That\u2019s more market concentration than in 2012, when Emblem had 45 percent of the market. In Washington state, Premera Blue Cross health plans won 62 percent of the exchange enrollment, compared with 40 percent of the individual market in 2012.\n\n\u2022 In the other states Kaiser looked at\u2014Minnesota, Nevada, and Rhode Island\u2014competition in the exchanges looks similar to the prereform markets. Enrollment isn\u2019t over until March 31, and it\u2019s probably too soon to draw firm conclusions, especially from just a handful of states. But it looks as if the exchanges are increasing competition in some places and hindering it in others.","185":"Two weeks out from the ObamaCare enrollment deadline, a new survey shows about one-third of uninsured American have no plans to buy insurance -- despite the law's requirement to do so.\n\nAnd despite the administration's aggressive campaign to spread the word about the health care law, the same survey shows a startling percentage of people still don't know about the Affordable Care Act's basic provisions.\n\nThe report from Bankrate.com was released Monday, in the final stretch of the government's effort to sign people up for coverage. After March 31, some who do not have coverage could face a penalty under the law -- though, in recent weeks, the administration has created wiggle room to let those who have trouble getting insurance avoid a fine.\n\nThe Bankrate.com report showed 34 percent of uninsured say they plan to stay uninsured. The most common reason cited was that they consider health insurance to be too expensive. Others are simply opposed to the health care law or think they are healthy enough to go without insurance.\n\nBut the poll revealed lingering hurdles for the Obama administration. Seventy-percent of uninsured Americans said they did not know about the law's subsidies, which are meant to defray at least some of the additional costs from buying health insurance.\n\n\"This is a staggeringly high percentage,\" Bankrate.com insurance analyst Doug Whiteman said in a statement\n\nAbout half also said they hadn't heard about the looming enrollment deadline. This, despite increased efforts by the administration to urge Americans to sign up before March 31.\n\nThe poll of 3,005 adults was taken from Feb. 20 to March 9. It had a margin of error of 6.1 percentage points.","186":"Element not valid\n\nThe element requested is either not valid or does not exist.","187":"How Obamacare Impacts Small Business Transactions\n\nLast week, I wrote about some of the ways Obamacare impacts small businesses, specifically five requirements Obamacare places on small businesses and five opportunities Obamacare affords small businesses. As discussed, while small businesses (i.e. companies with fewer than 50 employees) are exempt from many of the most rigorous requirements of the Affordable Care Act -- most notably, the Employer Mandate -- there are still some requirements and even some opportunities that small business owners should be aware of regarding Obamacare.\n\nAs an Obamacare attorney, I have observed that the factors a small business has to consider with respect to the Affordable Care Act can change quite dramatically if its workforce grows beyond 50 full-time employees. This can occur over time as a result of the natural growth of the business but can also happen rapidly and unexpectedly as a result of a business transaction.\n\nHere are three tips that any small business owner considering a business transaction should keep in mind to ensure that there are no unexpected Obamacare surprises as a result of the transaction:\n\n1. Count Hours, Not Just Employees\n\nTo determine how many full-time employees a business has for purposes of the Affordable Care Act, a business has to count not only its actual full-time employees (those work more than 30 hours per week) but also the number of hours worked by its part-time employees. The number of hours worked by part-time employees is aggregated to calculate a company's full-time equivalents. Therefore, as part of the due diligence process, the acquiring company should focus not only on the target company's full-time employees but also its full-time equivalents. If the target company's and acquiring company's full-time employees and full-time equivalents combine to total more than 50 employees, the new combined company will be subject to the Employer Mandate and other requirements of Obamacare.\n\n2. Remember Controlled Groups\n\nWhile the process above might seem obvious in the context of two related businesses that combine (i.e. a gardening business buys its competitor down the street to form a larger gardening business), it is less intuitive but still applicable in the context of unrelated businesses under common ownership.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act assesses liability with respect to the Employer Mandate on what the Tax Code calls a \"controlled group\" basis. Essentially, what this this means is that companies that are otherwise totally separate businesses are treated as one company for certain purposes if they are owned by the same or similar people (or corporations).\n\nTherefore, when purchasing a business in an M&A transaction, the acquirer needs to consider the workforce not only of the business it is acquiring but also of other seemingly unrelated businesses it may own.\n\n3. Beware of Successor Liability\n\nUntil now, we have been thinking about acquisitions of small businesses that prior to acquisition were exempt from the Employer Mandate. But what if the target business had more than 50 employees and was therefore subject to all of Obamacare?\n\nWhile there is still some ambiguity that is awaiting further guidance from the IRS, the possibility of successor liability is important to keep in mind. This would mean that the purchaser could be on the hook for any liabilities of the previous owners if they failed to comply with the Affordable Care Act. Therefore, it is important to ask about and seek evidence of the company's compliance with the applicable provisions of Obamacare or the new owner could be left holding the bag for the previous owner's actions. Additionally, a purchaser should consider the possibility of post-closing liability in any transaction, and ensure that the transaction document contains the appropriate representations and allocates responsibility for any Affordable Care Act penalties accordingly.\n\nFollow Avi Sinensky on Twitter: www.twitter.com\/avisinensky","188":"Americans buying health insurance outside the new Obamacare exchanges are being forced to swallow premiums up to 56 percent higher than before the health law took effect because insurers have jumped the cost to cover all the added features of the new Affordable Care Act.\n\nAccording to a cost report from eHealthInsurance, a nationwide online private insurance exchange, families are paying an average of $663 a month and singles $274 a month, far more than before Obamacare kicked in. What's more, to save money, most buyers are choosing the lowest level of coverage, the so-called \"bronze\" plans.\n\nThe firm provided the costs to Secrets through their new online price index, which gives the averages of what people are paying for insurance sold through their system.

That's because the average age is 36, older than the administration had hoped for.\n\nExplaining the higher costs, Mast said, \"There are likely other factors, but what is important is that moving forward, there needs to be a collective effort to enroll as many people as possible and create a broad and diverse risk pool to keep premiums in check. eHealth can help in that effort by enrolling consumers off-exchange and is pushing to be able to enroll people in subsidy-eligible plans as well.\"\n\nThere is a hint of good news, though, in firm's the price index. While the current costs for insurance are higher than before Obamacare, they have come down over the past several months.\n\nBelow is a cost summary provided by eHealthInsurance:\n\n\u2014 Premiums have increased by 39 percent to 56 percent, compared to pre-Obamacare coverage. As of Feb. 24, the average premium for an individual health plan selected through eHealth without a subsidy was $274 per month, a 39 percent increase over the average individual premium for pre-Obamacare coverage.\n\n\u2014 The most recent average premium for plans without a subsidy chosen by families was $663 per month, a 56 percent increase over the average family premium in Feb. 2013, which was $426 per month.\n\n\u2014 For both individual and family applicants, bronze plans have been the most popular plan type chosen since the beginning of open enrollment.\n\n\u2014 Shoppers chose less expensive plans as open enrollment progressed.

A month later, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said GOP leaders would have \u201cconversations\u201d with members about possible ideas that could go into a theoretical alternative to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIt was hard to miss the incompatibility of Cantor\u2019s promise and Boehner\u2019s half-hearted hedge.\n\nThat said, Robert Costa reports that House Republican leaders are still moving towards some kind of reform blueprint to present to voters in advance of the 2014 midterms.

But (a) they\u2019ve spent five years promising a bill, not a set of principles; (b) what\u2019s needed are specific provisions that can be scored, not vague blueprints; and (c) the Affordable Care Act already has some of the Republicans\u2019 favorite provisions in it.\n\nOr put another way, health care policy is hard. A political party that\u2019s serious about substance and policy outcomes will have to invest a lot of time and energy into crafting a health care plan that works.\n\nAnd yet, at this point, the Republican approach rests with presenting a fragile coin. On one side of the coin we see a bunch of hollow complaints about the ACA; on the other side we see a list of ideas Republicans have always liked, but which do not amount to a real, credible plan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to where you can compare the two perspectives, Republican and Democrat,\u201d House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told Costa.\n\nThat\u2019s actually a compelling point, and a side-by-side comparison would contribute quite a bit to the debate. Which party\u2019s approach would cover more of the uninsured? Which offers more consumer protections? Which would improve the nation\u2019s long-term finances? Which would do more to help lower costs within the system without sacrificing quality of care?","190":"You\u2019ve reached this page because what you were looking for does not exist or there\u2019s been an error.

The deadline to get insurance is March 31. After that, you\u2019ll have to wait until November to sign up.\n\nMany of the people I\u2019ve met have told me they were surprised at just how affordable insurance on the Health Insurance Marketplace can be. Six out of 10 uninsured Americans can get covered for $100 per month or even less \u2014 some a lot less.\n\nHere in Austin, a family of four earning $50,000 a year can get covered for as little as $64 per month. A 27-year-old earning $25,000 can get covered for as little as $85 per month.\n\nSecurity and peace of mind are just a click or call away. You may even find that you\u2019re eligible for assistance to lower the cost of your premium.\n\nYou can sign up 24 hours a day, seven days a week at HealthCare.gov (which is working smoothly) or at 800-318-2596. You can even get in-person help in your own community: Just visit localhelp.healthcare.gov and punch in your zip code. If you are a Spanish speaker, you can access our Spanish language website at CuidadoDeSalud.gov and you can get in-person help in Spanish, too.\n\nSo don\u2019t delay! Join the 5 million Americans who already have signed up for a plan and the millions more who\u2019ve learned they\u2019re eligible for Medicaid for this year.\n\nLet me tell you about one of these people who lives here in Texas. On a recent visit to the Lone Star State, I met Mark Sullivan, a 31-year-old software developer. Though he was eager to start his own business, the thought of fending for himself without his employer-based health coverage made him hesitate.\n\nBut then Mark researched his options on HealthCare.gov. You can imagine his excitement when he found a good plan for less than $80 a month.\n\nMark signed up to get covered, and now he\u2019s focused on growing his own business. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to express how much that means to me,\u201d he told me.\n\nBefore the Affordable Care Act, hardworking families in Austin had few real options. Even if you worked hard and took responsibility, you could still have the rug pulled out from under you if you or someone in your family got sick, had an accident or experienced another hardship. You could pay your premium dutifully every month, only to have your insurer refuse to pay for care when you needed it most because you hit an annual or lifetime cap in coverage expenses.\n\nBut today, here in Austin, it truly is a new day. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, there is choice and competition. In fact, you can now choose from 76 qualified health plans. Before the Affordable Care Act, many consumers had few if any real choices.\n\nUnlike the old system, once you enroll, nobody can take your coverage away from you just because you get sick. And your insurance company can\u2019t charge you more just because you are a woman; being a woman is no longer a pre-existing condition!\n\nWhat\u2019s more, by law, insurance companies now have to cover health services such as doctor\u2019s visits, prescription drugs, ambulatory care and hospital stays. Preventive care, like cancer and cholesterol screenings, is covered with no additional money out of your pocket.\n\nBut if you don\u2019t enroll by March 31, you won\u2019t get this security that comes with a marketplace plan \u2014 and you can\u2019t enroll again until this fall.\n\nThe good news is that security for you and your family is only a click or call away: You just need to sign up by March 31 if you want marketplace coverage this year.","192":"House Republican leaders have come up with a new health care proposal. And based on a report in the Washington Post, it will look a lot like their old health care proposals\u2014the ones that would have done very little to improve access, reduce financial distress, and contain health care spending. But this new plan would be different in one key respect. Implementing this sort of Republican plan now would probably mean taking away coverage from quite a lot of people who just got it. That\u2019s a pretty big deal.\n\nOf course, they don\u2019t admit that. The main feature of the Republican approach, according to the Post\u2019s Robert Costa, will be cross-state purchasing, expansion of high-risk pools, and malpractice reform. The idea, which Republicans have been talking about for 20 years, would mean that somebody in, say, New York could buy a policy from a carrier in, say, North Dakota. Sounds great, right? We order shoes from far-flung websites and drive across the state line for beer\u2014why not do the same for health insurance? Here\u2019s why: A big reason coverage in places like New York has gotten expensive is local rules designed for protect people from insurance companies\u2019 misbehavior. In New York, carriers must sell to anybody, regardless of pre-existing condition, and they must provide a reasonably comprehensive set of benefits.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act effectively made those kinds of regulations national. But if the GOP were to get its way, scrapping Obamacare and replacing it with the yet-unpublished plan Costa describes, the insurance industry would likely evolve just like the credit card industry did, with carriers relocating to states with the least regulations. That would be good news for healthy people willing to carry bare-bones coverage, and for people with enough money to pay for a plan, would love this arrangement. But people with preexisting conditions, the ones who were only able to buy coverage thanks to the ACA\u2019s rules, would be back to the bad old days.\n\nNot to worry, Republicans always say\u2014that\u2019s the reason for high-risk pools, which are separate insurance arrangements for people who can\u2019t buy insurance on their own. In theory, high-risk pools may sound like a sensible idea. In practice, they are relatively expensive to run\u2014because, by definition, they don\u2019t have the premiums from healthy people to subsidize the cost of the sick. And they rarely get the money they need from government, because they lack constituencies powerful enough to fight for funding. As a result, high-risk pools almost always end up oversubscribed, leading to long waiting lists. And they typically provide less coverage for more money.","193":"Syracuse, N.Y. -- Obamacare has injected a big dose of competition into New York's individual health insurance market, according to a report released today by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe analysis by the health policy group provides a first glimpse at the shifts in the competitive landscape in New York and six other states that have released insurer-specific enrollment data.\n\nThe analysis shows New York's individual insurance market today is significantly more competitive today than it was in 2012 before the state created a health insurance exchange as part of Obamacare. It gauged competitiveness by looking at the market share of the largest insurer, the number of insurers with at least 5 percent market shares and how evenly market share is distributed across insurers.\n\n\n\nNew York's exchange market is the most competitive of the seven states analyzed.\n\nMarket shares of some of the biggest insurers offering individual health policies on the N.Y. health insurance exchange Wellpoint (Empire BlueCross BlueShield): 18 percent\n\nHealth Republic: 16 percent\n\nFidelis Care: 14 percent\n\nEmblem Health: 12 percent\n\nMVP Health Care: 10 percent\n\nMetroPlus Health Plan: 11 percent\n\nExcellus BlueCross BlueShield: 6 percent\n\nUnited Health: 2 percent\n\nOther insurers: 11 percent\n\n\n\nSixteen companies are offering individual health insurance policies through the exchange. Seven of them have market shares greater than 5 percent. Of the 16 companies participating in the exchange, 11 offered individual coverage in the state before Obamacare.\n\nWellpoint, which includes Empire BlueCross BlueShield, is New York's biggest player in the individual insurance market. It controlled 28 percent of the market in 2012. Its market share is now 18 percent.\n\nExcellus BlueCross BlueShield, the dominant insurer in Central New York, controlled 15 percent of the state's individual market in 2012. Its market share has declined to 6 percent.\n\nUnitedHealth had a 20 percent market share in 2012. Its market share has dwindled to 2 percent, because its prices are relatively high compared to competitors, according to the report.\n\nHealth Republic, a new insurer started by the Freelancers Union that offers some of the lowest rates in the state, has captured 16 percent of the market.\n\nSeveral smaller insurers have picked up market share. MVP Health Care, for example, has seen its market share grow to 10 percent, up from 2 percent before the advent of the health insurance exchange.\n\nYou can contact health writer James T.

Suddenly, everyone was asking her which health plan was best.\n\nOnce her nails had dried, she handed out a batch of business cards.\n\nNot long ago, a chance meeting with an insurance agent might have led strangers to start running in the opposite direction \u2014 or politely extricate themselves from the inevitable sales pitch. Yet as the March 31 deadline to enroll in a health care plan looms, health insurance agents have become some of the most popular people in town.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely true,\u201d Kelley Filice Jensen said with a chuckle.\n\nJensen, who has been in the insurance business for 15 years, said whenever parents at her children\u2019s schools discover her profession, they almost always tell her about a relative who needs advice or help signing up for a plan under the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cPeople, and their questions, are coming out of the woodwork,\u201d she said.\n\nPeople like Davlyn Spetch, 34, owner of Action Cleaning Service in San Jose. In late February, she sought out Jensen to help her pick the best Obamacare plan for her 13 employees. Jensen directed Spetch to a small-business plan that will give the business owner tax credits for the employee premiums she pays, but which also allows her employees\u2019 spouses and dependents to qualify for a federal tax subsidy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have the time to read through all the fine print and figure out every little detail of these plans,\u201d said Spetch, who said Jensen proved to be a \u201cgold mine\u201d of information.\n\nWhile online sites like eHealthInsurance.com and GetInsured.com have taken a bite out of independent agents\u2019 business, problems with California\u2019s health insurance website and the sometimes endless waits to talk to someone at official call centers have won these Rodney Dangerfields of the business world a newfound respect. They quickly became the go-to people for Obamacare.\n\n\u201cEveryone thought that insurance agents would go the way of travel agents,\u201d said Micah Weinberg, a health policy analyst at the Bay Area Council, a business advocacy group. \u201cBut here\u2019s the problem: Health insurance is actually more difficult to purchase after health care reform than it was before health care reform.\u201d\n\nWeinberg, an Obamacare supporter who called the belief that buying health insurance would be as easy as buying a book on Amazon \u201cludicrous on its face,\u201d said he\u2019s steered \u201cevery single person\u201d who has asked him about signing up for a health plan to insurance agents.\n\n\u201cThese are people who have sold health insurance for a living,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone else is still involved in on-the-job training.\u201d\n\nThose other people Californians can turn to include the 800 call-center operators at the Covered California insurance exchange\u2019s three sites. In addition, there are more than 5,000 enrollment counselors certified by Covered California. The exchange also counts 10,725 county social service workers who can enroll people in both expanded Medi-Cal and exchange plans. But there also are 11,600 insurance agents who have been certified by Covered California. All are free of charge.\n\nLarry Hicks, a Covered California spokesman, said enrollment counselors can educate consumers on their health care plan options and discuss the financial obligations under each plan, then enroll consumers once they choose a plan. But insurance agents are licensed to actually recommend specific health insurance companies and plans, both on and off the exchange.\n\n\u201cThe difference between us is pretty simple,\u201d said Robert Jetter, a seasoned East Bay insurance agent who compares a client\u2019s experience to dining at a cafeteria versus a five-star restaurant.\n\n\u201cThe guy in the cafeteria can tell you what the entrees are,\u201d said Jetter, the director at American Health Advocates in Alameda. \u201cBut the restaurant waiter can tell you which one tastes best.\u201d\n\nStill, Hicks said, insurance agents aren\u2019t for everybody. Enrollment counselors who are often found at community centers and enrollment events have a different appeal.\n\n\u201cI might be more comfortable walking into an office of the local chapter of the NAACP to sign up than walking into an office of an insurance company,\u201d said Hicks, who is African-American.\n\nInsurance agents say while they\u2019re pleased to be popular, there\u2019s a price to pay.\n\nThey generally earn about 4 percent commission for each Obamacare policy they write. And Neil Crosby, spokesman for the California Association of Health Underwriters, an industry group that represents 2,500 health insurance agents in the state, said the process of enrolling people in the new health plans often takes hours to explain \u2014 so much time that agents, he said, \u201ccannot get their regular work done.\u201d\n\nMoreover, most agents Crosby talks to say they have so far earned \u201cbasically nothing\u201d in commissions because insurance companies are so backed up processing applications and premiums. A lot of them, Crosby said, feel like they\u2019re beating their heads against a wall because of the workload.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cI will tell you that the majority of agents I know and talk with feel like it\u2019s just part of what they think is the right thing to do. \u201c\n\nContact Tracy Seipel at 408-920-5343.

Fewer people have signed up than the administration had hoped, especially among the young and healthy. For many people, even the previously uninsured, the choices in the Obamacare market are simply not what they\u2019re looking for in a health insurance plan.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to understand why.\n\nObamacare replaces a wide variety of market-determined plans with a limited number of plans containing narrow networks of doctors and hospitals and a required set of items covered. No more cheap catastrophic care plan for the young man in his first job. Families and businesses can\u2019t choose an insurance plan that meets their circumstances and needs. Now the government sets the plans and the networks.\n\nThe result is that cancer patients are losing access to the doctors and hospitals they rely on. Parents are losing their trusted pediatricians. And families may not have access to the hospital nearest to their homes.\n\nConsider this: In Georgia, one of the five insurers offering plans on the Obamacare exchanges has just one hospital in the entire state in its network. In California and New York, major plans exclude the world-class Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles and New York City\u2019s Memorial Sloan-Kettering.\n\nFor those with serious and chronic illnesses, there is more terrible news. Many people are finding that their expensive, life-saving medications are not covered under their new Obamacare plans.\n\nThese narrow plans with narrow networks mean fewer choices, higher costs, and difficult decisions for millions of Americans.\n\nSome families do pay less for their monthly premiums for Obamacare-subsidized plans. Many more working families, who earn too much to qualify for subsidized plans, are paying considerably more each month for their health insurance. But the monthly premium is not the only cost in a health insurance plan.\n\nFamilies are finding that their insurance won\u2019t begin paying for care until they\u2019ve spent $5,000, $10,000, or more of their own money toward the deductible first. And once the deductible is met, the co-insurance (the amount the plan pays) may be as low as 60 percent, leaving individuals to pay the rest of the bill for their care by themselves.\n\nMost plans in the previous insurance market had an \u201cout-of-pocket\u201d cap to prevent people from losing everything in the event of a serious health problem. But in the Obamacare exchanges, some plans are offered with out-of-pocket protection only for care provided in-network. If you go to a doctor or hospital outside of your network, your insurance plan may pay nothing.\n\nPeople who rely on an expensive medication\u2014for multiple sclerosis, severe rheumatoid arthritis, or HIV for example\u2014are seeing their medication costs skyrocket. If the medication is covered by their insurance plan, they may still have to pay 40 percent of the cost, or thousands of dollars a year, up to the out-of-pocket limit. If the medication is not covered, they must pay the full price and the cost does not count toward the deductible or out-of-pocket maximum. Their expenses then are literally limitless.\n\nOne of the most serious problems with Obamacare is that it mistakes health insurance for health care. Obamacare supporters pretend that if every person has a health insurance plan, then they are getting the health care they need. That is simply not true. As we have seen, a plan that doesn\u2019t include your doctor or your medication doesn\u2019t provide the care you need. But there is another serious problem quickly coming into view.\n\nFor decades, poor people in this country have been eligible for Medicaid. The amount the government pays doctors to see Medicaid patients, however, is very low. At some point, when a doctor is not getting paid enough to cover the basic expenses of providing care, he or she will stop accepting Medicaid patients, or get out of medicine altogether. That is why today Medicaid patients can wait months for care, if they can find a doctor who will see them at
