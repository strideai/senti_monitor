Still, that's far below the national rate of 6.6 percent that month. Rates were unchanged in six states.\n\n\n\nThe data demonstrates that the steady decline in the unemployment rate nationwide has been broad-based, occurring throughout much of the country. The overall U.S. unemployment rate has fallen 1 percentage point in the past 12 months.\n\n\n\nTwenty-three states reported more hiring in January, while 27 said that the number of jobs fell. Harsh winter weather weighed on hiring nationwide, with employers adding just 129,000 jobs in January. That's below the average monthly gain of about 180,000 in the previous two years.\n\n\n\nThe job gains are calculated from a survey of employers, while the unemployment rate stems from a separate survey of households. The two surveys sometimes produce disparate results. In January, the household survey painted a more positive view of the nation's job market than the employer survey did.\n\n\n\nRhode Island had the highest unemployment rate, at 9.2 percent. The state's economy has suffered from a housing bust and manufacturing slump. Illinois and Nevada had the next highest rates, both at 8.7 percent, followed by California, with 8.1 percent.\n\n\n\nNorth Dakota had the lowest rate, at 2.6 percent. It has benefited from an oil and gas drilling boom. Nebraska had the next-lowest rate, at 3.5 percent, followed by South Dakota at 3.6 percent.\n\n\n\nNationwide, hiring improved in February, as employers added 175,000 jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent, but partly for an encouraging reason: more Americans started searching for jobs, though most didn't find one right away. Still, the fact that they began job hunting suggests they were more encouraged about their prospects.\n\n\n\nThe states with the biggest job gains in January were Texas, which added 33,900 positions, mostly in construction, education and health, and restaurants and hotels. Ohio had the next-largest gain, with 16,700, followed by Arizona, with 8,900. Vermont, Rhode Island and Nevada also reported healthy increases.\n\n\n\nCalifornia posted the largest decline, losing 31,500 positions, mostly in construction, government and in a category that includes retail, transportation and utilities.

Prior to the benchmarking process, the last time Indiana\u2019s rate was lower than the national rate was June of 2012.\n\nDespite a gain of 4,600 jobs in the manufacturing sector, Indiana shed a total of 7,100 private sector jobs in January mainly due to the extreme nature of the winter season, which has been cited by the U.S. Federal Reserve as one of the chief causes of employment contraction throughout the country.\n\n\u201cThere are many positives to note this month,\u201d said Scott B. Sanders, commissioner of the Indiana Department of Workforce Development. \u201cIndiana\u2019s unemployment rate is not only lower than our neighboring states, but the national rate as well. In addition, 2,700 Hoosiers returned to the labor force and fewer were unemployed in January than at any time since August of 2008, causing our rate to fall almost one-half of a percentage point in one month.\u201d\n\nSanders also noted Indiana\u2019s 2013 total private sector job growth number was revised upward by 8,200 jobs to 50,800 by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and despite the extreme winter weather, initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits were nearly 6,000 below January 2013 levels.\n\nSectors showing gains in January include: Manufacturing (4,600), Financial Activites (1,400) and Professional and Business Services (200), Sectors showing decline in January include: Trade, Transportation & Utilities (-4,900), Construction (-4,300), Private Educational & Health Services (-2,100) and Leisure and Hospitality (-600). Total non-farm employment decreased in January (-10,000).\n\nTotal private sector jobs were revised upward (+3,200) for December by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Still, that\u2019s far below the national rate of 6.6 percent that month. Rates were unchanged in six states.\n\nThe data demonstrates that the steady decline in the unemployment rate nationwide has been broad-based, occurring throughout much of the country. The overall U.S. unemployment rate has fallen 1 percentage point in the past 12 months.\n\nTwenty-three states reported more hiring in January, while 27 said that the number of jobs fell. Harsh winter weather weighed on hiring nationwide, with employers adding just 129,000 jobs in January. That\u2019s below the average monthly gain of about 180,000 in the previous two years.\n\nThe job gains are calculated from a survey of employers, while the unemployment rate stems from a separate survey of households. The two surveys sometimes produce disparate results. In January, the household survey painted a more positive view of the nation\u2019s job market than the employer survey did.\n\nRhode Island had the highest unemployment rate, at 9.2 percent. The state\u2019s economy has suffered from a housing bust and manufacturing slump. Illinois and Nevada had the next highest rates, both at 8.7 percent, followed by California, with 8.1 percent.\n\nNorth Dakota had the lowest rate, at 2.6 percent. It has benefited from an oil and gas drilling boom. Nebraska had the next-lowest rate, at 3.5 percent, followed by South Dakota at 3.6 percent.\n\nNationwide, hiring improved in February, as employers added 175,000 jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent, but partly for an encouraging reason: more Americans started searching for jobs, though most didn\u2019t find one right away. Still, the fact that they began job hunting suggests they were more encouraged about their prospects.\n\nThe states with the biggest job gains in January were Texas, which added 33,900 positions, mostly in construction, education and health, and restaurants and hotels. Ohio had the next-largest gain, with 16,700, followed by Arizona, with 8,900. Vermont, Rhode Island and Nevada also reported healthy increases.\n\nCalifornia posted the largest decline, losing 31,500 positions, mostly in construction, government and in a category that includes retail, transportation and utilities.

The national unemployment rate in January was 6.6 percent -- the lowest national rate since October 2008.\n\n\"Despite a slight increase in the January unemployment rate, Iowa's unemployment conditions have improved substantially from one year ago,\" said Teresa Wahlert, director of Iowa Workforce Development in a news release issued Monday. \"The state's annual average unemployment rate for 2013 dropped to 4.6 percent from 5.2 percent in 2012. Iowa had the fifth-lowest unemployment rate in the nation in 2013.\"\n\nINDEPTH LOOK AT STATS:\n\nIowa nonfarm employment decreased by 7,300 jobs in January, lowering the total to 1,536,900. The monthly drop was dominated by larger-than-expected service sector layoffs in trade and transportation, as seasonal workers were laid off. In the goods-producing sector, construction also contributed to the loss.\n\n\n\nGovernment was down 800 jobs in local and federal government, outweighing the gains in state government. Nonfarm employment has steadily trended upward despite the recent weakness, and is currently 19,500 jobs higher than one year ago (+1.3 percent).\n\nProfessional and business services added the most jobs in January (+1,600), partly due to early seasonal hiring in accounting and tax specialty firms. This monthly gain more than offset the slight loss in temporary help services. Financial activities added 900 jobs to offset smaller losses over the last few months. This sector has been resilient in Iowa, and is 900 jobs higher than a year ago and also at an all-time high.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, retail trade accounted for over half of the jobs lost this month (-4,500), which was largely due to retail stores reducing their staff to pre-holiday levels. Transportation and warehousing industries also dropped employment (900), reflecting the seasonal layoffs of package delivery couriers. The construction sector pared jobs for the second month in a row (-2,600). However, the outlook for this sector is bright with the demand for new residential housing and commercial buildings on the rise.\n\nCompared to last January, nonfarm employment has added 19,500 jobs. As a result of the annual benchmark revision, manufacturing is once again leading all sectors in year-over-year gains (+4,100). Education and health services followed closely behind (+4,000), and professional and business services ranked in third place (+3,900). Information services has been on a downward trend for the past decade, and trails last year\u2019s level by 800 jobs. Construction is down a slight 400 jobs from one year ago.","48":"News 13 needs your help to decide the 2016 Everyday Hero of the Year.\n\nREAD about and WATCH the four nominees and their incredible stories.

Kerry Koonce crunches the numbers for Iowa Workforce Development. \u201cOur rate was at 4.3-percent \u2014 it\u2019s a tenth of a percent up from 4.2 in December. Part of that is due to benchmarking as the numbers change a little bit. But, compared to January 2013 \u2014 we were at five percent \u2014 so we are significantly below where we were a year ago,\u201d Koonce says.\n\nThe benchmarking Koonce mentioned is the annual process where they bring all of last year\u2019s monthly numbers up to date before figuring the new year numbers. Koonce says the numbers released each month sometimes don\u2019t include all the information available. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s a quarter later when all of the data comes in, January\u2019s data, it can be April before we see everything. So we go back and true up those numbers to what the real information is from what employers report on their quarterly information and those kinds of things,\u201d Koonce says. \u201cAnd so you will see some changes in each month\u2019s numbers of the previous year which overall can have an impact on what the annual rate is and those kinds of things.\u201d\n\nThe numbers show the state lost 7,300 jobs from December to January. \u201cThe majority of that came in the trade, transportation and utilities area\u2026most of it in retail trade. And what it looks like is the seasonable adjustment numbers maybe didn\u2019t capture everything. So, we are expecting that maybe next month that\u2019s going to kind of even back out,\u201d according to Koonce.\n\nFifty-six-hundred of the lost jobs were in that trade, transportation and utilities sector. \u201cWe think that when the February numbers come out \u2014 and those will come out later this month \u2014 we will see where we are normally at this time of year,\u201d Koonce says.\n\nRegardless of how the numbers are adjusted, she says the overall picture is improving. \u201cWe\u2019re almost a full percentage point below where we were this time last year. So that\u2019s a significant improvement for our economy as we continue move forward,\u201d Koonce says. \u201cPlus, our unemployment claims continue to decrease, new claims continue to go down.\u201d The January 2013 unemployment rate for the state was five percent.\n\nThe U.S. unemployment rate for January inched down to 6.6-percent from 6.7-percent in December.

Search crews are scouring two giant arcs of territory amounting to the size of Australia \u2014 half of it in the remote seas of the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nCmdr. William Marks, a spokesman for the U.S. 7th Fleet, said finding the plane was like trying to locate a few people somewhere between New York and California.\n\nMalaysian officials said early in the search that they suspected the plane backtracked and flew toward the Strait of Malacca, just west of Malaysia. But it took a week for them to confirm Malaysian military radar data that suggested that route. On Tuesday, Thai military officials said their own radar showed an unidentified plane, possibly Flight 370, flying toward the strait beginning minutes after the Malaysian jet's transponder signal was lost.\n\nAir force spokesman Air Vice Marshal Montol Suchookorn said the Thai military doesn't know whether the plane it detected was Flight 370.\n\nThailand's failure to quickly share possible information about the plane may not substantially change what Malaysian officials now know, but it raises questions about the degree to which some countries are sharing their defense data.\n\nFlight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur at 12:40 a.m. Malaysian time March 8 and its transponder, which allows air traffic controllers to identify and track the airplane, ceased communicating at 1:20 a.m.\n\nMontol said that at 1:28 a.m., Thai military radar \"was able to detect a signal, which was not a normal signal, of a plane flying in the direction opposite from the MH370 plane,\" back toward Kuala Lumpur. The plane later turned right, toward Butterworth, a Malaysian city along the Malacca strait. The radar signal was infrequent and did not include any data such as the flight number.\n\nWhen asked why it took so long to release the information, Montol said, \"Because we did not pay any attention to it. The Royal Thai Air Force only looks after any threats against our country.\" He said the plane never entered Thai airspace and that Malaysia's initial request for information in the early days of the search was not specific.\n\n\"When they asked again and there was new information and assumptions from (Malaysian) Prime Minister Najib Razak, we took a look at our information again,\" Montol said. \"It didn't take long for us to figure out, although it did take some experts to find out about it.\"\n\nThe search area for the plane initially focused on the South China Sea, where ships and planes spent a week searching. Pings that a satellite detected from the plane hours after its communications went down eventually led authorities to concentrate instead on two vast arcs \u2014 one into central Asia and the other into the Indian Ocean.\n\nMalaysia said over the weekend that the loss of communications and change in the aircraft's course were deliberate, whether it was the pilots or others aboard who were responsible.\n\nMalaysian police are considering the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board, but have yet to give any update on what they have uncovered.\n\nInvestigators had pointed to a sequence of events in which two communications systems were disabled in succession \u2014 one of them before a voice from the cockpit gave an all-clear message to ground controllers \u2014 as evidence of a deliberate attempt to fly the plane off-course in a hard-to-detect way. On Monday, they backtracked on the timing of the first switch-off, saying it was possible that both were cut at around the same time, leading to fresh speculation that some kind of sudden mechanical or electrical failure might explain the flight going off-course.\n\nMalaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said it was not out of the question that there was some kind of problem aboard the plane, though he noted it still was intact enough to send a signal to a satellite several hours later.\n\nAs further confirmation that someone was still guiding the plane after it disappeared from civilian radar, airline pilots and aviation safety experts said an onboard computer called the flight management system would have to be deliberately programmed in order to follow the pathway taken by the plane as described by Malaysian authorities.\n\n\"If you are going to fly the airplane to a waypoint that is not a straight ... route to Beijing, and you were going to command the flight management computer and the autopilot system, you really have to know how to fly the airplane,\" said John Gadzinski, a U.S. Boeing 737 captain.\n\n\"If you were a basic flight student and I put you in an airborne 777 and gave you 20 minutes of coaching, I could have you turn the airplane left and right and the auto throttle and the autopilot would make the airplane do what you want,\" he said. \"But to program a waypoint into the flight management computer, if that is what they flew over, is a little bit harder.\"\n\nInvestigators have asked security agencies in countries with passengers on board to carry out background checks.\n\nChina announced Tuesday that background checks of the 154 Chinese citizens on board turned up no links to terrorism, apparently ruling out the possibility that Uighur Muslim militants who have been blamed for terror attacks within China might have been involved in the disappearance.\n\n\"So far there is nothing, no evidence to suggest that they intended to do harm to the plane,\" said Huang Huikang, China's ambassador to Malaysia.\n\nA Chinese civilian aviation official previously said there was no sign of the plane entering the country's airspace on commercial radar. The government has not said whether this has been confirmed by military radar data.\n\nA group of relatives of Chinese passengers in Beijing said they decided Tuesday to begin a hunger strike to express their anger over the handling of the investigation and the lack of any sign of the plane.\n\nThe search for the aircraft is among the largest in aviation history.\n\nThe U.S. Navy said P-3 and P-8 surveillance aircraft were methodically sweeping over swaths of ocean, known as \"mowing the grass,\" while using radar to detect any debris in the water and high-resolution cameras to snap images.\n\nAustralian and Indonesian planes and ships are searching waters to the south of Indonesia's Sumatra Island all the way down to the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.\n\nHuang said China had begun searching for the plane in its territory, but gave no details. When asked at a Foreign Ministry briefing Tuesday in Beijing what this search involved, ministry spokesman Hong Lei said only that satellites and radar were being used.\n\nChina also was sending ships to the Indian Ocean, where they will search 300,000 square kilometers (186,000 square miles) of sea.\n\nThe area being covered by the Australians is even bigger \u2014 600,000 square kilometers (232,000 square miles) \u2014 and will take weeks to search thoroughly, said John Young, manager of Australian Maritime Safety Authority's emergency response division.\n\n\"This search will be difficult. The sheer size of the search area poses a huge challenge,\" Young said. \"A needle in a haystack remains a good analogy.\"\n\n___\n\nDoksone reported from Bangkok.

On Monday, they backtracked on the timing of the first switch-off, saying it was possible that both were cut at around the same time, leading to fresh speculation that some kind of sudden mechanical or electrical failure might explain the flight going off-course.\n\nMalaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said it was not out of the question that there was some kind of problem aboard the plane, though he noted it still was intact enough to send a signal to a satellite several hours later.\n\nAs further confirmation that someone was still guiding the plane after it disappeared from civilian radar, airline pilots and aviation safety experts said an onboard computer called the flight management system would have to be deliberately programmed in order to follow the pathway taken by the plane as described by Malaysian authorities.\n\n\"If you are going to fly the airplane to a waypoint that is not a straight ... route to Beijing, and you were going to command the flight management computer and the autopilot system, you really have to know how to fly the airplane,\" said John Gadzinski, a U.S. Boeing 737 captain.\n\n\"If you were a basic flight student and I put you in an airborne 777 and gave you 20 minutes of coaching, I could have you turn the airplane left and right and the auto throttle and the autopilot would make the airplane do what you want,\" he said. \"But to program a waypoint into the flight management computer, if that is what they flew over, is a little bit harder.\"\n\nInvestigators have asked security agencies in countries with passengers on board to carry out background checks.\n\nChina announced Tuesday that background checks of the 154 Chinese citizens on board turned up no links to terrorism, apparently ruling out the possibility that Uighur Muslim militants who have been blamed for terror attacks within China might have been involved in the disappearance.\n\n\"So far there is nothing, no evidence to suggest that they intended to do harm to the plane,\" said Huang Huikang, China's ambassador to Malaysia.\n\nA Chinese civilian aviation official previously said there was no sign of the plane entering the country's airspace on commercial radar.

(AP Photo\/Bullit Marquez)]\n\nThe fact that the turn away from Beijing was programmed into the computer has reinforced the belief of investigators \u2014 first voiced by Malaysian officials \u2014 that the plane was deliberately diverted and that foul play was involved. It has also increased their focus on the plane\u2019s captain and first officer.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Chinese ambassador to Malaysia, Huang Huikang, told reporters that the Chinese government had ruled out suspicions of the Chinese on board, who made up two-thirds of the 227 passengers, according to Chinese news organizations.\n\nPrime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia told reporters Saturday that his government believed the plane had been diverted, because its transponder and other communications devices had been manually turned off several minutes apart. U.S. officials were told of the new information over the weekend.\n\nBut Malaysian authorities on Monday reversed themselves on the sequence of events they believe took place on the plane in the crucial minutes before ground controllers lost contact with it early March 8. They said it was the plane\u2019s first officer \u2014 the co-pilot \u2014 who was the last person in the cockpit to speak to ground control. And they withdrew their assertion that another automated system on the plane called Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS, had been disabled when the co-pilot spoke.\n\nFlight 370\u2019s Flight Management System reported its status to ACARS, which in turn transmitted information back to a maintenance base, according to a U.S. official. This shows that the reprogramming happened before ACARS stopped working. ACARS ceased to function about the same time oral radio contact was lost and the airplane\u2019s transponder also stopped, fueling suspicions that foul play was involved in the plane\u2019s disappearance.\n\nInvestigators are scrutinizing radar tapes from when the plane first departed Kuala Lumpur because they believe the tapes would show that after the plane first changed its course, it passed through several pre-established \u201cwaypoints,\u201d which are like virtual mile markers in the sky. That would suggest that the plane was under control of a knowledgeable pilot, because passing through those points without using the computer would have been unlikely.\n\nAccording to investigators, it appears that a waypoint was added to the planned route. Pilots do that in the ordinary course of flying if air traffic controllers tell them to take a different route, to avoid weather or traffic. But in this case, the waypoint was far off the path to Beijing.\n\nWhoever changed the plane\u2019s course would have had to be familiar with Boeing aircraft, though not necessarily the 777 \u2014 the type of plane that disappeared. U.S. officials and aviation experts said it was far-fetched to believe that a passenger could have reprogrammed the Flight Management System.\n\nNormal procedure is to key in a five-letter code \u2014 gibberish to non-aviators \u2014 that is the name of a waypoint. A normal flight plan consists of a series of such waypoints, ending in the destination airport. For an ordinary flight, waypoints can be entered manually or uploaded into the FMS by the airline.\n\nOne of the pilots keys in a waypoint on a separate screen known as a scratchpad, and after confirming that it has no typographical errors, pushes another button to move it into the sequence in the flight plan. Normal practice is to orally confirm the waypoint with the other pilot, then push another button to instruct the airplane to go there. With the change in course, the plane would bank at a comfortable angle, around 20 degrees, and make the turn. Passengers would not feel anything unusual.\n\nBoth Bloomberg News and ABC News previously reported on the programmed turn.\n\nOne U.S. safety expert, John Cox, a former airline union safety official, said someone taking such pains to divert the plane does not fit the pattern of past cases when pilots intentionally crashed and killed everyone on board.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an inconsistency in what we\u2019ve seen historically,\u201d he said, comparing the disappearance of Flight 370 with two murder-suicides, of an Egyptair flight off Nantucket Island in 1999 and a SilkAir jet in Indonesia in 1997. In those crashes, he said, the pilot involved simply pushed the nose of the plane down and flew into the water.\n\nThe authorities searched the homes of the pilots in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday, seizing a flight simulator that one of them had in his home.","152":"Hi\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nAlready a print edition subscriber, but don't have a login?","153":"Cmdr.

Wang Zhao\/AFP\/Getty Images\n\nSome Chinese relatives of passengers aboard missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 threatened on Tuesday to go on a hunger strike to pressure Malaysian authorities to release more information about the search for the plane. \"Now we have no news, and everyone is understandably worried,\" said Wen Wanchen, whose son is among the 239 people on the flight. \"The relatives say they will go to the [Malaysian] Embassy to find the ambassador. The Malaysian ambassador should be presenting himself here. But he's not. Relatives are very unsatisfied. So you hear them saying 'hunger strike',\" he said. This comes as the hunt for the plane enters its 11th day and the search zone has again been shifted. China has deployed 21 satellites to scour its territory for the plane, while officials from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) announced Tuesday they are now searching an area southwest of Perth, on Australia\u2019s west coast \u2014 much farther south than before, bordering Antarctica. Authorities were searching in an area to the northwest, and it was not immediately clear why the search area was changed. Even though Australia\u2019s portion of the search area has been reduced, it is still more than 372,000 square miles \u2014 about the size of Spain and Portugal. \"A needle in a haystack remains a good analogy,\" John Young, general manager of the emergency response division of the AMSA, told reporters. \"The aircraft could have gone north or south, and if it went south, this is AMSA's best estimate of where we should look with the few resources we have at our disposal for such a search,\" he said. The entire search area covers 2.57 million square miles. It now stretches from the Caspian Sea in Asia to the southern Indian Ocean. Malaysia said Tuesday it conferred with U.S. and Chinese officials on the search, an unprecedented 26-nation operation. Investigators are convinced that someone with deep knowledge of the Boeing 777-200ER plane and commercial navigation diverted the jet \u2014 carrying 12 crew members and 227 passengers who were mostly Chinese citizens \u2014 perhaps thousands of miles off its planned course from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. But intensive background checks of everyone aboard have so far failed to find anyone with a possible political or criminal motive to crash or hijack the plane, Western security sources and Chinese authorities have said. China has begun to search for MH370 in Chinese territory in the northern search corridor, the country\u2019s official Xinhua news agency said. Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei told a daily news conference that 21 satellites were involved. \"In accordance with Malaysia's request, we are mobilizing satellites and radar to search over the Chinese section of the northern corridor, which the Malaysians say the plane may have flown over,\" he said.\n\nStill looking for motive\n\nChina's ambassador to Malaysia, Huang Huikang, said his country had carried out a detailed investigation into its nationals aboard the flight and could rule out their involvement. \"The probe into the incident's cause is not suitable to be conducted in a high-profile way,\" Huang told Chinese reporters, according to an official microblog run by state television. U.S. and European security sources said efforts by various governments to investigate the backgrounds of everyone on the flight had not, as of Monday, turned up links to militant groups or anything else that could explain the jet's disappearance. A European diplomat in Kuala Lumpur also said trawls through the passenger manifest had come up blank. One source familiar with U.S. inquiries said the pilots were being studied because of the technical knowledge needed to disable the aircraft's communications systems. Malaysian officials said on Monday that suicide by the pilot or co-pilot was a line of inquiry, although they stressed that it was only one of the possibilities under investigation. Flight MH370 vanished from civilian air traffic control screens off Peninsular Malaysia's east coast less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur. Investigators piecing together patchy data from military radar and satellites believe that someone turned off the aircraft's identifying transponder and ACARS system, which transmits maintenance data, and turned west, crossing the Malay Peninsula and following a commercial aviation route toward India. Thailand's military said Tuesday that a re-examination of its data showed what may have been the plane crossing the Malay Peninsula toward the Strait of Malacca, just minutes after Flight MH370's communications went down, and that it had not shared the information with Malaysia earlier because it was not specifically asked for it. Thailand had previously said it had not detected any sign of the plane. With only its own radar to go on, it took Malaysia a week to confirm that Flight 370 had entered the strait, an important detail that led it to change its search strategy. When asked why it had taken so long to release the information, Thailand's Air Vice Marshal Montol Suchookorn said, \"Because we did not pay any attention to it. The Royal Thai Air Force only looks after any threats against our country, so anything that did not look like a threat to us, we simply look at it without taking actions.\" What happened next is less certain. The plane may have flown for another six hours or more after dropping off Malaysian military radar about 200 miles northwest of the island of Penang. The plane continued to send pings to satellites for up to five hours after its transponder was turned off, but those signals were not intended to work as locators. The best they can do is place the plane on broad arcs. On the basis of the last signal picked up from MH370, the plane may be on one arc stretching north from Laos to the Caspian Sea or on one running south from an area west of Indonesia to the Indian Ocean off Australia.\n\nFlight simulator","155":"Sorry, this page is temporarily unavailable\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.

So why did Thailand wait so long to share the data with the Malaysian-led international search efforts? Because nobody specifically asked for it, Air Vice Marshal Montol Suchookorn said to the AP.\n\nAs always with stories about leads for Flight 370, it's important to proceed with caution. Given that current theories about the plane's disappearance involve the assumption that it flew for hours without sending radar data, it's not clear how helpful the Thai radar information can be. So for what it's worth, the new radar information depicts a plane that might be Flight 370 taking a \"twisting\" path to the Strait of Malacca, outside of Thai airspace. The Thai military emphasized that they're not sure whether this plane is Flight 370 or not. A week after the plane's disappearance, Malaysian officials confirmed that their radar data indicates the plane did enter the Strait.\n\nMontol responded to questions about the delay in his country's data release by saying that the Air Force \"did not pay any attention to\" the plane on their radar. He added: \"The Royal Thai Air Force only looks after any threats against our country, so anything that did not look like a threat to us, we simply look at it without taking actions.\" He added:\n\n\"When they asked again and there was new information and assumptions from (Malaysian) Prime Minister Najib Razak, we took a look at our information again...It didn't take long for us to figure out, although it did take some experts to find out about it.\"\n\nRight now, there's plenty of speculation on why Flight 370 disappeared. But the search area for the plane is only expanding, as international teams appear no closer to finding the jet than they were days ago. Based on an assumption that the plane flew for a long while without sending out radar data, officials have expanded their search to an area of nearly 30 million square miles.","160":"Page Not Found\n\nThe page you have asked for may no longer be available or may have moved.\n\nSearching below may help you locate the items you're looking for.","161":"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia - When someone at the controls calmly said the last words heard from the missing Malaysian jetliner, one of the Boeing 777's communications systems had already been disabled, authorities said Sunday, adding to suspicions that one or both of the pilots were involved in disappearance of the flight.\n\nInvestigators also examined a flight simulator confiscated from the home of one of the pilots and dug through the background of all 239 people on board, as well as the ground crew that serviced the plane.\n\nCBS News\n\nThe Malaysia Airlines jet took off from Kuala Lumpur in the wee hours of March 8, headed to Beijing. On Saturday, the Malaysian government announced findings that strongly suggested the plane was deliberately diverted and may have flown as far north as Central Asia or south into the vast reaches of the Indian Ocean.\n\nAuthorities have said someone on board the plane first disabled one of its communications systems - the Aircraft and Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS - about 40 minutes after takeoff. The ACARS equipment sends information about the jet's engines and other data to the airline.\n\nAround 14 minutes later, the transponder that identifies the plane to commercial radar systems was also shut down. The fact that both systems went dark separately offered strong evidence that the plane's disappearance was deliberate.\n\nOn Sunday, Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said at a news conference that that the final, reassuring words from the cockpit - \"All right, good night\" - were spoken to air traffic controllers after the ACARS system was shut off. Whoever spoke did not mention any trouble on board.\n\nAir force Maj. Gen. Affendi Buang told reporters he did not know whether it was the pilot or co-pilot who spoke to air traffic controllers.\n\nGiven the expanse of land and water that might need to be searched, finding the wreckage could take months or longer. Or it might never be located. Establishing what happened with any degree of certainty will probably require evidence from cockpit voice recordings and the plane's flight-data recorders.\n\nThe search area now includes 11 countries the plane might have flown over, Hishammuddin said, adding that the number of countries involved in the operation had increased from 14 to 25.\n\n\"The search was already a highly complex, multinational effort,\" he said. \"It has now become even more difficult.\"\n\nLai Seng Sin, AP\n\nThe search effort initially focused on the relatively shallow waters of the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca, where the plane was first thought to be. Hishammuddin said he had asked governments to hand over sensitive radar and satellite data to try to get a better idea of the plane's final movements.\n\nWith more information, he said, the search zone could be narrowed \"to an area that is more feasible.\"\n\nMalaysia is leading the search for the plane and the investigation into its disappearance.\n\nInvestigators are trying to answer these questions: If the two pilots were involved in the disappearance, were they working together or alone, or with one or more of the passengers or crew? Did they fly the plane under duress or of their own will? Did one or more of the passengers manage to break into the cockpit or use the threat of violence to gain entry and then seize the plane? And what possible motive could there be for diverting the jet?\n\nMalaysia's police chief, Khalid Abu Bakar, said he asked countries with citizens on board the plane to investigate their backgrounds, no doubt looking for anyone with terrorism ties, aviation skills or prior contact with the pilots. He said that the intelligence agencies of some countries had already done so and found nothing suspicious, but he was waiting for others to respond.\n\nPolice searched the homes of both pilots Saturday, the first time they had done so since the plane vanished, the government said. Asked why it took them so long, Khalid said authorities \"didn't see the necessity in the early stages.\"\n\nPolice confiscated the elaborate flight simulator that one of the pilots, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, had built in his home and reassembled it in their offices to study it for clues, Khalid said.\n\nZaharie, 53, who has three grown children and one grandchild, had previously posted photos online of the simulator, which was made with three large computer monitors and other accessories. Earlier this week, the head of Malaysia Airlines said the simulator was not in itself cause for any suspicion.\n\nA CBS News crew tried Sunday to visit the gated community where Zaharie lives, but the crew was turned away by beefed-up security.\n\n\n\nMalaysian police were also investigating engineers and ground staff who may have had contact with the plane before it took off, Khalid said.\n\nEven though the ACARS system was disabled on Flight 370, it continued to emit faint hourly pulses that were recorded by a satellite. The last \"ping\" was sent out at 8:11 a.m. - 7 hours and 31 minutes after the plane took off. That placed the jet somewhere in a huge arc as far north as Kazakhstan in Central Asia or far into the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nWhile many people believe the plane has crashed, there is a small possibility it may have landed somewhere and be relatively intact. Affendi, the air force general, and Hishammuddin, the defense minister, said it was possible for the plane to \"ping\" when it was on the ground if its electrical systems were undamaged.\n\nAustralia said it was sending one of its two AP-3C Orion aircraft involved in the search to remote islands in the Indian Ocean at Malaysia's request. The plane will search the north and west of the Cocos Islands, a remote Australian territory with an airstrip about 745 miles southwest of Indonesia, military chief Gen. David Hurley said.\n\nGiven that a northern route would have sent the plane over countries with busy airspace, most experts say the person in control of the aircraft would more likely have chosen to go south. The southern Indian Ocean is the world's third-deepest and one of the most remote stretches of water in the world, with little radar coverage.\n\nWhoever disabled the plane's communication systems and then flew the jet must have had a high degree of technical knowledge and flying experience, putting one or both of the pilots high on the list of possible suspects, Malaysian officials and aviation experts said.\n\nZaharie, the captain, was a supporter of a Malaysian opposition political party that is locked in a bitter dispute with the government, according to postings on his Facebook page and a friend, Peter Chong, who is a party member.\n\nChong said that he last saw Zaharie a week before the pilot left on the flight for Beijing and that they had agreed to meet on his return to organize a shopping trip for poor children.\n\n\"If I am on a flight, I would choose Captain Zaharie,\" he said. \"He is dedicated to his job. He is a professional and he loves flying.\"\n\nNo one answered the door Sunday at the home of co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid, but neighbors said there had been increased police presence in the area.\n\nNeighbors said the family was quiet and kept to themselves. One man called Hamid, 27, \"a nice boy who goes to mosque quite often.\"\n\n","162":"The Thai military has presented radar evidence that supports the hypothesis that, for an unknown reason, Malaysia Airlines flight 370 turned around as it flew over Pulau Perak in the Strait of Malacca.\n\nA Royal Thai Air Force spokesman shared the military's findings with CNN.

Doane notes that a lot has been made of the fact that police found a flight simulator inside Zaharie\u2019s house.\n\nBut a friend of the pilots insists Zaharie was a good man, and a good pilot, and asked who would have a flight simulator in their home, he replied, \u201canybody with aviation as a hobby \u2014 and you can afford it!\u201d\n\nInvestigators do believe that Flight 370 was diverted deliberately.\n\nMeanwhile, with the search area now encompassing a daunting 7 million-square miles, CBS News got a first up-close look at the so-called \u201csouthern corridor,\u201d and the U.S. Navy\u2019s role in combing that area to the south and west of Malaysia, in the Indian Ocean\n\nThe southern corridor is one of two vast areas where Malaysian authorities think Flight 370 could have ended up.\n\nThe U.S. Navy invited CBS News onboard its P-3 Orion, a plane designed to search and hunt submarines, as it flew out Monday over the world\u2019s third largest ocean.\n\nOne of the crew members on the Orion told Doane they were looking for almost anything that could suggest a civilian airliner was hiding beneath the waves; \u201cany kind of debris that might come from a plane \u2014 that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for right now.\u201d\n\nWith Navy planes covering the sky, the Pentagon announced it was removing its ship, the USS Kidd, from the search operation after it combed the Andaman Sea and found nothing.","166":"Server Error\n\n404 - File or directory not found.

It's up to the FBI to tell us if they need more experts to help because it's not for us to know what they have.\"\n\nMalaysian officials say they have been in touch with the FBI through the US embassy, where the agency has a permanent representative, from \"day one\".\n\n\"No matter what everyone says, the cooperation that I am getting for Malaysia and for what efforts I am doing, it is overwhelming,\" Hishammuddin said.\n\nTwo US security officials said on Monday that Malaysia had still not invited the FBI to send a team.\n\nOne source in Kuala Lumpur familiar with the investigation said an FBI team was in Malaysia to help with the probe. But another source familiar with the matter confirmed that no one had arrived from the United States to reinforce the FBI presence in the country.\n\nAn unprecedented search for the missing flight now stretches across Asia, from the Caspian Sea to the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nInvestigators are convinced that someone with deep knowledge of the Boeing 777-200ER and commercial navigation diverted the jet, carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew, perhaps thousands of miles off course.\n\nEXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE\n\nThe FBI has extensive experience in investigating plane disasters, including the crashes off the US east coast of TWA Flight 800 in 1996 and Egyptair Flight 990 in 1999.\n\nIn the case of Egyptair 990, the FBI helped air safety investigators establish that the crash was caused by a suicidal co-pilot.\n\nIn the TWA 800 case, the FBI conducted a lengthy investigation that eventually helped the National Transportation Safety Board discredit theories that the plane was hit by a missile, but instead was brought down by a freak accident involving overheated fuel.\n\nIndia, which has suspended search operations for the Malaysian plane pending a review of the satellite data, has said it had no complaints with the sharing of information.\n\n\"I think they (Malaysia) are sharing all the information. Every country has the capability up to their own airspace... So the information they have, they have shared,\" said Acquino Vimal, India's deputy high commissioner to Malaysia.\n\n\"I am yet to hear anything from our operational people saying that we are not getting information.\"\n\nThe jet disappeared in a region beset by rivalries over military capabilities and where sovereignty can be a grey issue.\n\nFurthermore, the need to co-operate has cast a potentially embarrassing light on regional surveillance capabilities, especially where the ability of nations to watch each other's airspace is concerned.\n\nIn Australia, a defence industry source said that any available information from its powerful radars pointing out to the Indian Ocean would likely be passed on to Malaysia in a \"highly sanitised way\" to conceal its origins and appease any concerns about Australian monitoring of neighbouring airspace.","170":"07.30 Please join us for today's live coverage of the search for Malaysia Airlines MH370 as Australia dispatches planes to check two large objects spotted in the ocean south west of Perth.\n\n06.44 The families of Chinese passengers aboard a missing Malaysia Airlines flight have insisted that their loved ones could still be alive, as Beijing said it was following developments closely.\n\nWen Wancheng refused to accept the announcement from Australiameant he had lost his son, who was a passenger on the flight.\n\n\"My son is still alive.

The Orion is expected to arrive in the area on Thursday afternoon. Three additional aircraft are expected to follow for a more intensive search.\n\nMr Abbott cautioned, however, that the task of locating these objects will be extremely difficult and \"it may turn out that they are not related to the search for flight MH370.\"\n\n03.00 The Washington Post assesses the theories on MH370's disappearance.\n\n02.15 AP reports that both sides of Malaysia's bitterly contested political divide are fighting over the disappearance and hunt for the missing plane.\n\nThe opposition is attacking the government, relishing in the international criticism that has been directed at leaders unused to such scrutiny. Pro-government blogs are focusing on the pilot's support for opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, hoping that suspicions against the former will discredit the latter.\n\nMalaysian politics have been defined in recent years by the government's attempts to stop the rise of opposition parties chipping away at its five-decade grip on power. Anwar, the opposition movement's main leader, spent six years in jail on corruption and sodomy charges, a campaign that Western rights groups and governments say is politically motivated.\n\nThe missing plane has reopened this fault line because the pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, is a supporter of Anwar and the uncle of his daughter-in-law.\n\n01.30 A blog by staff at Australian think tank The Lowy Institute says the loss of MH370 is a diplomatic mess, as well as a tragedy.\n\n01.00 The Washington Post reports that a simple computer upgrade that Malaysia Airlines decided not to purchase would have provided critical information to help find the airliner.\n\n00.27 ABC News reports the search area has been drastically narrowed to an area off the west coast of Australia.\n\nUS officials familiar with the investigation tell ABC News that the hourly satellite pings from the jet had yielded far more clues than expected, enabling the focus of the search to be cut in half - from an area roughly the size of Texas to that of Arizona.\n\n23.55 The Washington Post has a clever interactive that underlines the daunting scale of the search for the missing plane.\n\n22.55 Here is more of what Barack Obama had to say about the missing plane earlier:\n\nPresident Barack Obama said Wednesday the search for the missing Malaysian airliner was a \"top priority\" for the United States and offered every possible resource - including the FBI.\n\nIn his first on camera comments on the mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, Mr Obama offered thoughts and prayers to the relatives of the missing passengers.\n\n\"I want them to be assured that we consider this a top priority,\" Mr Obama told Dallas television station KDFW in an interview at the White House.\n\n\"We have put every resource that we have available at the disposal of the search process,\" he said.\n\n\"There has been close cooperation with the Malaysian government.\"\n\nMr Obama said the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board and any agency or official that deals with aviation was at the disposal of the investigation.\n\n22.25 An article in the New Straits Times has accused the Australian government of keeping vital information that could relate to flight MH370 under wraps.\n\n21.35 Obama has been speaking to local news networks today on a broad range of subjects, including MH370.\n\n<noframe>Twitter: Peter Doocy - Pres Obama on Malaysia Air Flt 370: \"Sometimes these things take time, but we hope and pray that we can get to the bottom of what happened\"<\/noframe>\n\n20.45 The scene at the Kuala Lumpur hotel where families are awaiting news of their loved ones got completely out of control this morning.

But now, 12 days after the disappearance, the FBI has been formally asked to the help the Malaysians examine the pilots' computer hard drives.\n\n<noframe>Twitter: Vaughn Sterling - CNN: FBI's forensics lab in Quantico, VA, which has experience retrieving data, is examining captain &amp; co-pilot's hard drives <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?src=hash&q=%23MH370\" target=\"_blank\">#MH370<\/a><\/noframe>\n\n17.55 Anwar Ibrahim, the Malaysian opposition leader, whose was once again given a prison sentence hours before the flight disappeared has given an interview to CNN. Capt Zaharie Shah was a member of his extended family and supporter of his party.

Two minutes later, the plane\u2019s transponder was switched off, and it disappeared from civilian radar.\n\nThe timings of the last message and the change in direction have been hotly debated - as the information could prove crucial in figuring out who or what was responsible. If contact was made after the change in course, it could possibly indicate the cockpit was aware of a problem which they hid from ground controllers.\n\nFariq Abdul Hamid invited two women into the cockpit of a of Malaysian airlines flight\n\n16.08 The FBI is formally joining the investigation into the missing airliner to help analyse the hard-drives from computers seized from Capt Zaharie's home. They will also try to recover the files that were deleted from the simulator a month before the flight.\n\nTwo security officers sit at the entrance of a hotel lounge in Beijing where relatives of passengers from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 are gathered\n\n15.30 As we reported yesterday, the home-made flight simulator recovered from the pilot\u2019s home included five practice runways. Here's one of the videos Capt Zaharie uploaded onto Youtube.\n\n15.15 The Telegraph's Harriet Alexander has been speaking to a European pilot, to find out what aviation professionals are saying about the events of the past 12 days. He said:\n\nVery strange goings on. Not too sure what to make of it. There is just not enough information to even support any sort of idea, and of course this has led to all sorts of theories.\n\nAlso quite hard for us to understand because Europe is so radar intensive - civil and military - so it would unthinkable here.\n\nFar too many strange theories, from non aviation personnel on aviation forums etc that I have just stopped to read them. Hope something is found in a fairly timely manner.\n\n14.05 One theory that seems to have some traction is that the plane may have been brought down after a massive fire broke out in the hold.\n\nBillie Vincent, a US aviation expert who was a forensic witness in the Lockerbie bombing trial, has suggested that either a blaze or an explosion was responsible for the plane crashing and could also explain the lack of communication.\n\nThe data released thus far most likely points to a problem with hazardous materials. This scenario begins with the eruption of hazardous materials within the cargo hold \u2013 either improperly packaged or illegally shipped \u2013 or both.\n\nMr Vincent believes a fire started in the cargo hold and gradually destroyed the plane\u2019s communications systems. He says toxic fumes would have quickly overwhelmed the passengers and crew.\n\nHe said he believed one of the pilots managed to put on an oxygen mask and tried to turn the plane, bound for Beijing, back to Kuala Lumpur.\n\nMr Vincent added: \u201cThe plane then continues until no fuel remains and crashes \u2013 most likely into the ocean as there has been no report of any Emergency Locator Transmitter signal which can be received by satellite if the crash was on land.\u201d\n\n13.27 The daughter of a crew member on board missing flight has tugged the heart strings of football fans after tweeting for her dad to come home to watch his favourite team.\n\nMalaysian Maira Nari posted the sincere message on the social media site after her dad missed his beloved Liverpool FC's 3-0 win over Manchester United on Sunday. Her father Andrew Nari, is a chief steward on the missing Malaysia Airlines flight.\n\n13.12 The pilot had programmed a route to a remote Maldives island which has a runway long enough to land a Boeing 777, according to the MailOnline.\n\nDiego Garcia is an overseas territory of the UK, which is rented to the US and is now a huge American naval base.\n\nAs we reported earlier - before the fateful Flight MH370, Capt Zaharie has apparently deleted several files from his homemade flight simulator.\n\n12.35 Mr Hussein also told the news conference that Malaysia had received radar data from other countries.\n\nHowever, as always, the news was shrouded in secrecy. \"I can confirm that we have received some radar data, but we are not at liberty to release information from other countries,\" he said.\n\n12.19 Malaysia's defence minister revealed in today's press conference that Investigators are trying to restore files deleted last month from the home flight simulator of the pilot, Capt.

Speaking to a scrum of reporters and photographers one said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know how long we will be waiting. It\u2019s been 12 days where\u2019s my son? Why aren\u2019t you giving me any answers.\u201d\n\n11.03 It has only just emerged that, after 12 days of searching, Indonesia has only just provided clearance for surveillance aircraft from Australia, Japan, the United Arab Emirates and Malaysia to overfly its territory, while saying its own vessels await instructions from Kuala Lumpur.\n\n10.36 Jonathan Pearlman in Kuala Lumpur says we now know the names of the flight simulator games used by the pilot of MH370 on his homemade device.\n\nPolice said Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah played the games Flight Simulator X, Flight Simulator 9 and X-Plane 10. The logs from these games were deleted on February 3 and police are trying to access the deleted information. I spoke yesterday to Peter Chong, a friend of the pilot, who said Zaharie was proud of the simulator but made no attempt to hide it and invited most of his friends to use it.\n\nThe investigation is ongoing but at this stage police appear to have found nothing suspicious.\n\nAn Indonesian Air Force military surveillance aircraft over the Malacca Strait searching for the missing plane\n\n10.10 The police chief is refusing to answer questions about their treatment of the two distraught relatives, who were dragged away after talking to gathered journalists.\n\n09.57 Right, after that excitement, some of the other developments to come out of today's press conference.\n\n* Malaysia says 'so far' no red flags on any missing jet passenger. Background checks on nearly all but three of the 239 passengers and crew on board a missing Malaysia Airlines jet have produced no \"information of significance\". Ukrainian and Russian passengers have not yet been checked\n\n* Files were recently deleted from the home flight simulator of the MH370 pilot. Police say the pilot deleted the logs of his home made flight simulator on February 3 and are still searching the device for clues. There were three separate games on the simulator.\n\n* Two Chinese relatives who were trying to speak to journalists before the briefing by Malaysian officials were heard screaming as they were dragged away by police.\n\n09.48 I've never seen anything quite like it - it's pandemonium as hundreds of reporters descend on two female relatives who were being ushered out of the conference by police.\n\nA Chinese family member of a passenger onboard MH370 screams as she is being brought into a room outside the media conference area at a hotel in Kuala Lumpur\n\n09.44 Incredible scenes as relatives of the passengers knocked to the floor in scuffles outside the media conference room in Kuala Lumpur. Women were forcibly removed after trying to attend plane news conference without permission.\n\n09.36 Hishammuddin Hussein, Malaysia's transport minister, is now giving his daily press conference. He confirms that the Maldives has found no evidence that MH370 flew over the tiny island on March 8.\n\nHe says they are sending a new team to Beijing to support passengers' families, imcluding representatives from the prime minister's office and the department of civil aviation.\n\nHe says Malaysia Airlines staff are innocent until proven guilty and there should be no further speculation from the press until more if known.\n\n09.30 A source close to the investigation has told Reuters news agency that they believe the plane most likely flew into the southern Indian Ocean, as opposed to north towards Pakistan and India.\n\n\"The working assumption is that it went south, and furthermore that it went to the southern end of that corridor,\" said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe view is based on the lack of any evidence from countries along the northern corridor that the plane entered their airspace, and the failure to find any trace of wreckage in searches in the upper part of the southern corridor.\n\n09.18 Authorities in the Maldives are now investigating reports that islanders saw a \"low-flying jumbo jet\" on the day MH370 vanished.\n\nPolice and the civil aviation authority were investigating reported sightings on a remote island, however the islands' National Defence Force said that no trace of Flight MH370 had been picked up on radar\n\nThe investigations were sparked by a report by the Haveeru news website which said that several local residents had spotted a large plane flying over the remote southern island of Kuda Huvadhoo on March 8.\n\n09.13 Our correspondent in Kuala Lumpur, Jonathan Pearlman, says the latest there is that have been were chaotic scenes as Chinese protesters gather inside the hotel conference room being used for daily press briefings.\n\nThe protesters, who represented the families of passengers on the plane and apparently came in from Beijing, demanded Malaysia reveal what it knows about the crash. The protesters screamed and wailed as they were led out of the briefing room. Of the 239 passsengers on MH370, 154 were Chinese nationals.\n\nIn other developments, the crash investigators still believe it is \u201chighly probably\u201d that MH370 was deliberately flown off course. I just spoke to a source close to the investigation who said investigators believe the plane\u2019s communications were deliberately disabled before it made its unusual turn westward. They are increasingly convinced the plane ended in the far southern section of the two huge corridors currently being searched.\n\nThe daily press briefing is due to begin shortly at 5.30 local time. The government said yesterday that police will be present today to provide an update on their investigation into the crew and pilots. As yet, nothing suspicious has emerged in the backgrounds of the pilot and co-pilot.\n\nSelamat Omar shows a picture of his son, flight engineer Mohd Khairul Amri Selamat who was onboard the missing plane\n\n09.06 Arguably the most important detail which will help investigators know whether they are dealing with a hijacking is when the plane changed course - whether it was before or after the co-pilot's last message to ground control.\n\nIt emerged overnight from US officials that the abrupt U-turn made by the plane is believed to have been programmed into the onboard computer before the last radio contact was made with the co-pilot.\n\nSources say the change in direction was made about 12 minutes before Fariq Abdul Hamid told controllers: \"All right, good night.\" This would indicate that the cockpit knew of possible difficult and did not alert officials.\n\n08.42 Peter Chong holds a smartphone displaying a picture of himself with missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah:\n\nREUTERS\n\n08.24 A girl takes part in a candlelight vigil organized by a social group, the Christian Muslim Alliance Pakistan, for passengers that were aboard a missing Malaysia Airlines plane in Islamabad, Pakistan:\n\nAP\n\n07.52 China has not yet found any sign the missing Malaysian Airlines jet entered in its territory, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said at a daily news briefing.\n\n07.40 New radar data from Thailand has given Malaysian investigators more potential clues for how to retrace the course of the missing Malaysian airliner.\n\nThai air force spokesman Air Vice Marshal Montol Suchookorn said that at 1:28 a.m on March 8, Thai military radar \"was able to detect a signal, which was not a normal signal, of a plane flying in the direction opposite from the MH370 plane,\" back toward Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe Thai air force did not check its records because the aircraft was not in \"Thai airspace and it was not a threat to Thailand\", the spokesman said, denying it had been \"withholding information\".\n\n07.22 This in from Reuters, investigators close to the search for MH370 believe it most likely that the plane flew into the southern Indian Ocean.\n\n\"The working assumption is that it went south, and furthermore that it went to the southern end of that corridor,\" said the source, referring to a search area stretching from west of Indonesia to the Indian Ocean west of Australia.\n\n05.55 For those of you waking up, a quick recap on the main developments from yesterday and overnight:\n\nEleven days have passed since Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 went missing, and 26 nations are struggling to search for the airliner over an area more than two-thirds the size of the continental United States.\n\nMalaysian and US officials believe the aircraft was deliberately diverted but an exhaustive background search of the 239 passengers and crew aboard has not yielded any possible motive or link to terrorism.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s top official in charge of the operation said it was vital to reduce the scale of the search and renewed appeals for sensitive military data from its neighbours that Malaysia believes may shed light on where the airliner flew.\n\nThe U.S. Navy said it had switched mainly to using P-8A Poseidon and P-3 Orion aircraft to search for the missing plane instead of ships and helicopters.\n\nInvestigators piecing together patchy data from military radar and satellites believe that someone turned off vital datalinks and turned west, re-crossing the Malay Peninsula and following a commercial route towards India.\n\nAfter that, ephemeral pings picked up by one commercial satellite suggest the aircraft flew on for at least six hours, but investigators have very little idea whether it turned north or south, triggering a search expanding across two hemispheres.\n\nPolice in the Indian Ocean island chain of the Maldives said they were investigating reports that people on one of its outer islands had seen a low-flying aeroplane there early on March 8. The police gave no further details.\n\nThe search covers a total area of 2.24 million nautical miles (7.68 million sq km), from central Asia to the southern Indian Ocean.\n\n05.50 Good morning and welcome to The Telegraph's live coverage of the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370.","171":"I have now been cultivating my woods for ten years, but lately, I\u2019ve become conscious of wanting more native wildflowers to \u2026 well, simply be there.

It was an adventur\u2026","172":"\n\nChris Brummitt and Thanyarat Doksone, The Associated Press\n\n\n\n\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Ten days after a Malaysian jetliner disappeared, Thailand's military said Tuesday it saw radar blips that might have been from the missing plane but didn't report it \"because we did not pay attention to it.\"\n\nSearch crews from 26 countries, including Thailand, are looking for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which vanished early March 8 with 239 people aboard en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Frustration is growing among relatives of those on the plane at the lack of progress in the search.\n\nAircraft and ships are scouring two giant arcs of territory amounting to the size of Australia -- half of it in the remote waters of the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nCmdr. William Marks, a spokesman for the U.S. 7th Fleet, said finding the plane was like trying to locate a few people somewhere between New York and California.\n\nEarly in the search, Malaysian officials said they suspected the plane backtracked toward the Strait of Malacca, just west of Malaysia. But it took a week for them to confirm Malaysian military radar data suggesting that route.\n\nMilitary officials in neighbouring Thailand said Tuesday their own radar showed an unidentified plane, possibly Flight 370, flying toward the strait beginning minutes after the Malaysian jet's transponder signal was lost.\n\nAir force spokesman Air Vice Marshal Montol Suchookorn said the Thai military doesn't know whether the plane it detected was Flight 370.\n\nThailand's failure to quickly share possible information about the plane may not substantially change what Malaysian officials now know, but it raises questions about the degree to which some countries are sharing their defence data. At a minimum, safety experts said, the radar data could have saved time and effort that was initially spent searching the South China Sea, many miles from the Indian Ocean.\n\n\"It's tough to tell, but that is a material fact that I think would have mattered,\" said John Goglia, a former member of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board.\n\n\"It's just bizarre they didn't come forward before,\" Scott Hamilton, managing director of aviation consultancy Leeham Co., said of Thai authorities. \"It may be too late to help the search ... but maybe them and the Malaysian military should do joint military exercises in incompetence.\"\n\nFlight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur at 12:40 a.m. March 8 and its transponder, which allows air traffic controllers to identify and track it, ceased communicating at 1:20 a.m.\n\nMontol said that at 1:28 a.m., Thai military radar \"was able to detect a signal, which was not a normal signal, of a plane flying in the direction opposite from the MH370 plane,\" back toward Kuala Lumpur. The plane later turned right, toward Butterworth, a Malaysian city along the Strait of Malacca. The radar signal was infrequent and did not include data such as the flight number.\n\nWhen asked why it took so long to release the information, Montol said, \"Because we did not pay any attention to it. The Royal Thai Air Force only looks after any threats against our country.\" He said the plane never entered Thai airspace and that Malaysia's initial request for information in the early days of the search was not specific.\n\n\"When they asked again and there was new information and assumptions from (Malaysian) Prime Minister Najib Razak, we took a look at our information again,\" Montol said. \"It didn't take long for us to figure out, although it did take some experts to find out about it.\"\n\nThe search area for the plane initially focused on the South China Sea. Pings that a satellite detected from the plane hours after its communications went down eventually led authorities to concentrate instead on two vast arcs -- one into Central Asia and the other into the Indian Ocean.\n\nMalaysia said over the weekend the loss of communications and change in the aircraft's course were deliberate, whether it was the pilots or others aboard who were responsible.\n\nMalaysian police are considering the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board, but have yet to say what they have uncovered.\n\nInvestigators had pointed to a sequence of events in which two communications systems were disabled in succession -- one of them before a voice from the cockpit gave an all-clear message to ground controllers -- as evidence of a deliberate attempt to fly the plane off-course in a hard-to-detect way. On Monday, they backtracked on the timing of the first switch-off, saying it was possible that both were cut around the same time, leading to new speculation that some kind of sudden mechanical or electrical failure might explain the flight going off-course.\n\nMalaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said some sort of problem aboard the plane was not out of the question, although he noted it still was intact enough to send a signal to a satellite several hours later.\n\nAs further confirmation that someone was still guiding the plane after it disappeared from civilian radar, airline pilots and aviation safety experts said an onboard computer called the flight management system would have to be deliberately programmed in order to follow the route taken by the plane as described by Malaysian authorities.\n\n\"If you are going to fly the airplane to a waypoint that is not a straight ... route to Beijing, and you were going to command the flight management computer and the autopilot system, you really have to know how to fly the airplane,\" said John Gadzinski, a U.S. Boeing 737 captain.\n\n\"If you were a basic flight student and I put you in an airborne 777 and gave you 20 minutes of coaching, I could have you turn the airplane left and right and the auto throttle and the autopilot would make the airplane do what you want,\" he said. \"But to program a waypoint into the flight management computer, if that is what they flew over, is a little bit harder.\"\n\nInvestigators have asked security agencies in countries with passengers on board to carry out background checks.\n\nChina said background checks of the 154 Chinese citizens on board turned up no links to terrorism, apparently ruling out the possibility that Uighur Muslim militants who have been blamed for terror attacks within China might have been involved.\n\n\"So far there is nothing, no evidence to suggest that they intended to do harm to the plane,\" said Huang Huikang, China's ambassador to Malaysia.\n\nA Chinese civilian aviation official has said there was no sign of the plane entering the country's airspace on commercial radar.\n\nA group of relatives of Chinese passengers in Beijing said they decided to begin a hunger strike to express their anger over the handling of the investigation.\n\nOne relative displayed a sign reading, \"Hunger strike protest. Respect life. Return my relative. Don't want become victim of politics, Tell the truth.\"\n\nThe search for the aircraft is among the largest in aviation history.\n\nThe U.S. Navy said P-3 and P-8 surveillance aircraft were methodically sweeping over swaths of ocean, known as \"mowing the grass,\" while using radar to detect any debris in the water and high-resolution cameras to snap images.\n\nAustralian and Indonesian planes and ships are searching waters to the south of Indonesia's Sumatra Island all the way down to the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.\n\nHuang said China had begun searching for the plane in its territory, but gave no details. When asked at a Foreign Ministry briefing in Beijing what this search involved, ministry spokesman Hong Lei said only that satellites and radar were being used.\n\nChina also was sending ships to the Indian Ocean, where they will search 300,000 square kilometres of sea.\n\nThe area being covered by the Australians is even bigger -- 600,000 square kilometres -- and will take weeks, said John Young, manager of Australian Maritime Safety Authority's emergency response division.\n\n\"This search will be difficult. The sheer size of the search area poses a huge challenge,\" Young said. \"A needle in a haystack remains a good analogy.\"\n\nBritain's Prime Minister David Cameron telephoned his Malaysian counterpart to offer the U.K.'s help in the first direct contact between the two since the flight disappeared, according to Downing Street.\n\nCameron did not offer specifics on what particular military or civilian assistance could be provided, the prime minister's spokesman, Jean-Christophe Gray, said Tuesday.\n\n\"It was very much inviting any specific requests from the Malaysians,\" Gray said. \"Prime Minister Najib said he would think about that and let us know if they have any specific requests.\"","173":"7:40 pm: Beware!

Neither does the Taliban. The search, which now involves 25 countries, has not given any answers to the families and friends of the missing 239 passengers, or to the international community glued to the news. But as investigators continue to speculate, so does the general public, confusing an already muddled investigation.\n\nThe media's dissemination of sensational rumors \u2014 snatching up comments as evidence and masking anecdotes as analysis \u2014 not only adds noise to the clamorous search, but also detracts from the immense and important effort to find Flight MH370.\n\nSpeculations of foul play are growing as the investigation deepens, as well as deliberations as to whether or not terrorism was a factor. The plane traveled in a confused path before disappearing from all communications grids, leading some experts to suggest that the plane may have landed in remote mountains in Pakistan or Afghanistan where Taliban forces are known to hide.\n\nZabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban in Afghanistan, said that the missing plane had \"nothing to do with them,\" according to Reuters. \"It happened outside Afghanistan, and you can see that even countries with very advanced equipment and facilities cannot figure out where it went,\" Mujahid said. \"So we also do not have any information, as it is an external issue.\"\n\nA leader of the Pakistani Taliban also claims his militia had nothing to do with the flight's disappearance. He added, however, that he and his forces could only dream of such a plan.\n\n\"We wish we had an opportunity to hijack such a plane,\" he told Reuters by telephone.\n\nContinuing the desperate search for any information on Flight MH370, Malaysian officials have sent diplomatic notes to several countries requesting radar information, satellite images and details of their respective sea, land and air search operations. Indian and Pakistani officials have responded that they had not seen anything suspicious. Indian officials in particular deny what they deem an outrageous claim that the flight could have flown over their country without any notice or alarm.\n\nWhile investigators attempt to eliminate theories regarding the missing plane, media outlets attempt to fill in the gaps. On Sunday the Daily Mail published an article, \"Is missing Malaysian jet the world's first CYBER HIJACK?\" The article bases claims of terrorism on anecdotes that one of the pilots aboard the plane was a vocal political activist and a \"gadget geek.\"\n\n\"It was against this background that, seven hours later, he took control of a Boeing 777-200 bound for Beijing and carrying 238 passengers and crew,\" the article states.\n\nComments by one security expert, Dr. Sally Leivesley, about a possible cyber-attack, have spawned handfuls of reports that Flight MH370 was hijacked by cell phone. Though a possibility, the claim is just one on a list of several.\n\nOn Monday CNN journalists turned to discussing \"supernatural\" conspiracy theories. Other outlets have entertained alien abduction theories.\n\nEven Hollywood Life is weighing in on the situation. Meanwhile conspiracy theories weed through the Internet, suggesting that major world governments have taken control of the plane.\n\n\"These conspiracy theories are rubbish, one independent aviation analyst said to Manchester Evening News. \"They are just absolute balderdash.

I think they are proving to be a distraction.\"\n\nCyber-attack theories based on one expert's comments; 9\/11-style hijackings based on speculation; alien abduction and supernatural powers: The media has it all when it comes Flight MH370.\n\nConsidering how emotional this search has been, it might be time for the media to cool it with the frantic speculation.","175":"(BANGKOK, AP) \u2014 Thailand\u2019s military said Tuesday that its radar detected a plane that may have been Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 just minutes after the jetliner\u2019s communications went down, and that it didn\u2019t share the information with Malaysia earlier because it wasn\u2019t specifically asked for it.\n\nA twisting flight path described Tuesday by Thai air force spokesman Air Vice Marshal Montol Suchookorn took the plane to the Strait of Malacca, which is where Malaysian radar tracked Flight 370 early March 8. But Montol said the Thai military doesn\u2019t know whether it detected the same plane.\n\nThailand\u2019s failure to quickly share possible information regarding the fate of the plane, and the 239 people aboard it, may not substantially change what Malaysian officials know, but it raises questions about the degree to which some countries are sharing their defense information, even in the name of an urgent and mind-bending aviation mystery.\n\nWith only its own radar to go on, it took Malaysia a week to confirm that Flight 370 had entered the strait, an important detail that led it to change its search strategy.\n\nWhen asked why it took so long to release the information, Montol said, \u201cBecause we did not pay any attention to it. The Royal Thai Air Force only looks after any threats against our country, so anything that did not look like a threat to us, we simply look at it without taking actions.\u201d\n\nHe said the plane never entered Thai airspace and that Malaysia\u2019s initial request for information in the early days of the search was not specific.\n\n\u201cWhen they asked again and there was new information and assumptions from (Malaysian) Prime Minister Najib Razak, we took a look at our information again,\u201d Montol said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take long for us to figure out, although it did take some experts to find out about it.\u201d\n\nFlight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur at 12:40 a.m. Malaysian time and its transponder, which allows air traffic controllers to identify and track the airplane, ceased communicating at 1:20 a.m.\n\nMontol said that at 1:28 a.m., Thai military radar \u201cwas able to detect a signal, which was not a normal signal, of a plane flying in the direction opposite from the MH370 plane,\u201d back toward Kuala Lumpur. The plane later turned right, toward Butterworth, a Malaysian city along the Strait of Malacca. The radar signal was infrequent and did not include any data such as the flight number.\n\nHe said he didn\u2019t know exactly when Thai radar last detected the plane. Malaysian officials have said Flight 370 was last detected by their own military radar at 2:14 a.m.\n\nThe search area for the plane initially focused on the South China Sea, where ships and planes spent a week searching. Pings that a satellite detected from the plane hours after its communications went down have led authorities to concentrate instead on two vast arcs \u2014 one into central Asia and the other into the Indian Ocean \u2014 that together cover an expanse as big as Australia.\n\nThai officials said radar equipment in southern Thailand detected the plane. Malaysian officials have said the plane might ultimately have passed through northern Thailand, but Thai Air Chief Marshal Prajin Juntong told reporters Tuesday that the country\u2019s northern radar did not detect it.","176":"{ }\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - Checks into the background of the Chinese citizens on board the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner have uncovered no links to terrorism, the Chinese ambassador in Kuala Lumpur said Tuesday.\n\nThe remarks will dampen speculation that Uighur Muslim separatists in far western Xinjiang province might have been involved with the disappearance of the Boeing 777 and its 239 passengers and crew early on March 8.\n\nThe plane was carrying 154 Chinese passengers, when Malaysian officials say someone on board deliberately diverted it from its route to Beijing less than one hour into the flight. A massive search operation in the Indian Ocean and beyond has yet to find any trace of the plane.\n\nChinese Ambassador to Malaysia Huang Huikang said background checks on Chinese nationals didn't uncover any evidence suggesting they were involved in hijacking or an act of terrorism against the plane, according to the state Xinhua News Agency.\n\nUighur groups have been involved in attacks inside China, and some have a presence in the Afghan-Pakistan border area, where al-Qaida and other transnational jihadi groups are based.\n\nMalaysian police are investigating the pilots and ground engineers of the plane, and have asked intelligence agencies from countries with passengers on board to carry out background checks on those passengers.\n\nMalaysian authorities say that someone on board the flight switched off two vital pieces of communication equipment, allowing the plane to fly almost undetected. Satellite data shows it might have ended up somewhere in a giant arc stretching from Central Asia to the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.\n\nHuang said China had begun searching for the plane on its territory, but gave no details. When asked at a Foreign Ministry briefing Tuesday in Beijing what this search involved, ministry spokesman Hong Lei said only that satellites and radar were being used.\n\nA Chinese civilian aviation official previously has said that there was no sign of the plane entering the country's airspace on commercial radar. The government has not said whether this has been confirmed by military radar data.\n\nMalaysian police say they are investigating the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board, but have yet to give any update on what they have uncovered.\n\nMalaysian military radar spotted the plane in the northern reaches of the Strait of Malacca at 2:14 a.m. on March 8, just over 1 \u00c2\u00bd hours after it took off from Kuala Lumpur. That is the plane's last known confirmed position. A signal to a satellite from the plane at 8:11 a.m. suggests that, by then, it was somewhere in a broad arc spanning from Kazakhstan to the Indian Ocean west of Australia.\n\nInvestigators are scouring over what little data they have to try and determine who was in control of the plane when it stopped communicating. They have indicated that whoever was in control must have had aviation experience and knowledge of commercial flight paths.\n\nOn Monday, Malaysian Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said an initial investigation indicated that the last words ground controllers heard from the plane - \"All right, good night\" - were spoken by the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid.\n\nOn Sunday, the defense minister Hishammuddin Hussein said this were spoken before the jetliner's data communications systems - the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System - had been switched off, suggesting the voice from the cockpit was knowingly deceiving ground controllers.\n\nBut Ahmad made a potentially significant change to that timeline.\n\nSpeaking alongside Hishammuddin, he said that while the final data transmission from ACARS, which gives plane performance and maintenance information, came before the co-pilot's words, it was still unclear at what point the system was switched off.\n\nThe search for the plane is one of the largest in aviation history, and now involves 26 countries.\n\nIt was initially focused on seas on either side of Peninsular Malaysia, in the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca. It has since expanded to include the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal and 11 countries to the northwest that the plane in theory could have crossed, including China and India.\n\nAmerican, Australian and Indonesian planes and ships are searching waters to the south of Indonesia's Sumatra Island all the way down to the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.\n\nChina was also sending ships to the Indian Ocean, where they will search two blocks of sea covering a total of 300,000 square kilometers (186,000 square miles), or three times the area they had searched in the South China Sea.\n\nThe area being covered by the Australians is even bigger - 600,000 square kilometers (232,000 square miles) - and will take weeks to search thoroughly, said John Young, manager of Australian Maritime Safety Authority's emergency response division.\n\n\"This search will be difficult. The sheer size of the search area poses a huge challenge,\" Young said. \"A needle in a haystack remains a good analogy.\"\n\n{ }","177":"The unprecedented hunt for a missing Malaysia Airlines jet is continuing 10 days after it vanished. A summary of the latest information on the search for the plane and the investigation into what happened:\n\n- THE INVESTIGATION\n\nChinese authorities say they have checked into the background of all Chinese nationals on board the missing Boeing 777 jetliner but have uncovered no links to terrorism or any evidence to suggest they were involved in hijacking, according to Huang Huikang, the Chinese ambassador in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe finding dampens speculation that Uighur separatists in China's far western Xinjiang province might have been involved with plane's disappearance. Of the 239 passengers and crew aboard when the plane disappeared on March 8, 154 were Chinese.\n\nFor now, Malaysian authorities believe someone on board the flight intentionally switched off two vital pieces of communication equipment and deliberately diverted the aircraft. That could only have been done by the pilots - either willingly or forced - or someone on board with considerable flying experience.\n\nMalaysian police are investigating the two pilots and ground engineers, and analyzing a flight simulator seized from the pilot's home.\n\nInvestigators are also checking backgrounds, including those of ground crew who could have come into contact with the plane, to see if links to terrorists, personal problems or psychological issues could be factors.\n\n- THE HUNT\n\nChina says it has begun using satellites to scan its territory for the missing plane after satellite data indicated the jet's last position could be anywhere along two sections of a vast arc stretching from Central Asia to the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean. China also sent naval ships that had been in the South China Sea to the Indian Ocean.\n\nMalaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said that the search area in the northern and southern \"corridors\" totals 2.24 million square nautical miles (nearly 3 million square miles), or 7.7 million square kilometers. That's about the size of Australia. Twenty-six countries are involved in the hunt.\n\nGiven the shift to the much wider search area, the U.S. Navy says that it will use long-range naval aircraft to look for the plane, and send its destroyer, the USS Kidd, back to normal duties. Australia is leading the search efforts in the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nThe northern search corridor includes countries with busy airspace that likely would have noticed an unidentified aircraft in their territory. China, India and Pakistan are among the nations that say they have seen no sign of the plane.\n\n- THE QUESTIONS\n\nBeyond the question of where the plane is, many unknowns remain. Investigators are also considering: If the two pilots were involved in the disappearance, were they working together or alone, or with one or more of the passengers or crew? Did they fly the plane under duress or of their own will?\n\nDid one or more of the passengers manage to break into the cockpit or use the threat of violence to gain entry and then seize the plane? And what possible motive could there be for diverting the jet?","178":"Nice End to the Week...Clouds Increasing This Weekend\n\nIt is looking like a pretty nice Friday for us. We should see some clouds move back into the area \u2026","179":"Could a massive passenger jet slip past radar, cross international borders and land undetected?\n\nThat's a key question investigators are weighing as they continue the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which vanished March 8 on a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, bound for Beijing.\n\nRadar does have some blind spots, and it's possible to avoid being spotted by flying at low altitude, analysts told CNN.\n\nBut experts are divided over whether that could be what happened to the missing Boeing 777-200ER.\n\nJeffrey Beatty, a security consultant and former FBI special agent, says someone could have planned a route that avoided radar detection.\n\n\"It certainly is possible to fly through the mountains in that part of the world and not be visible on radar. Also, an experienced pilot, anyone who wanted to go in that direction, could certainly plot out all the known radar locations, and you can easily determine, where are the radar blind spots?\" he said. \"It's the type of things the Americans did when they went into Pakistan to go after Osama bin Laden.\"\n\nInformation about the plane's path came into sharper focus on Tuesday, when the Thai government released data that bolsters the belief among investigators that the missing jet took a sharp westward turn after communication was lost.\n\nThe Thai military was receiving normal flight path and communication data from the jet on its planned route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing until 1:22 a.m., when it disappeared from its radar.\n\nSix minutes later, the Thai military detected an unknown signal, a Royal Thai Air Force spokesman told CNN. This unknown aircraft, possibly Flight 370, was heading in the opposite direction.\n\nMalaysia says the evidence suggests the plane was deliberately flown off course, turning westward and traveling back over the Malay Peninsula and out into the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe Thai data corroborate what the Malaysian military had found earlier -- that the plane did indeed turn around toward the Strait of Malacca.\n\nBut the Thai contact was short-lived. \"The unknown aircraft's signal was sending out intermittently, on and off, and on and off,\" the spokesman said. The Thai military lost the unknown aircraft's signal because of the limits of its military radar, he said.\n\nOn Monday, the Malaysian newspaper New Straits Times reported that the plane may have evaded radar detection by flying at an altitude of 5,000 feet or less and through mountainous terrain. The newspaper cited unidentified sources for its reporting, which CNN could not confirm.\n\nA senior Indian military official told CNN on Monday that military radar near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands isn't as closely watched as are other radar systems. That leaves open the possibility that Indian radar systems may not have picked up the airplane at the time of its last known Malaysian radar contact, near the tiny island of Palau Perak in the Strait of Malacca.\n\nMalaysian officials said Monday that they were not aware of the Malaysian newspaper's report.\n\n\"It does not come from us,\" said Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya.\n\nU.S. officials have said they think it's unlikely the plane flew northward over land as it veered off course. If it had, they've said, radar somewhere would have detected it. It's also unlikely that the plane was landed at a remote airport, since remote airports aren't typically equipped with the long runways that the Boeing jetliner needs, the officials have said.\n\nAnalysts interviewed by CNN said that it would be extremely difficult to fly such a large aircraft so close to the ground over a long period of time, and that it's not even clear that doing so would keep the plane off radar scopes.\n\n\"Five thousand (feet) isn't really low enough to evade the radar, and that's kind of where general aviation flies all the time anyway, and we're visible to radar,\" said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n\n\"It just seems really highly improbable, unless we've been overestimating a lot of other countries' radar system capabilities,\" said Daniel Rose, an aviation and maritime attorney.\n\nBuck Sexton, a former CIA officer who's now national security editor for TheBlaze.com, said radar would have detected the plane had it flown over land.\n\n\"This is a bus in the sky. It's a lot harder to get under the radar with this kind of thing than I think most people realize,\" he said. \"So really, while the search I know has extended to this vast area stretching up into (central or south Asia), clearly there really should be much more of a search over open water -- because this is not getting past people's radars.\"\n\nIt wouldn't be easy to avoid radar detection, but some experts say it could be done.\n\n\"Anything like this is possible,\" radar expert Greg Charvat told CNN's \"Piers Morgan Live.\" \"But to do it, you'd have to have very detailed information of the type of radars, their disposition, their heights and their waveforms to pull that off.\"\n\nDifferent countries would likely be using different radar systems, he said, but it's unclear how advanced the technology is in many countries.\n\n\"It took a great deal of skill to do this,\" CNN aviation analyst Jim Tilmon said. \"I think somebody was at the controls who understood the value of altitude control to eliminate the possibility of being spotted and tracked on radar.\"\n\nWhoever was in control in the cockpit, he said, \"really had the ability to map out a route that was given the very best chance of not being detected.\"\n\nOne other possibility, he said: The plane could have shadowed another plane so closely that it slipped by radar detection.\n\nOther analysts say that would require so much skill that it would be nearly impossible to pull off without getting caught.\n\nThere's another possible wrinkle, experts say. Some countries may be hesitant to reveal what they've seen on radar.\n\n\"They want to protect their own capabilities,\" Beatty said. \"Their intelligence services are not going to want to publicize exactly what their capabilities are.\"","180":"The unprecedented hunt for a missing Malaysia Airlines jet is continuing 10 days after it vanished.\n\nThe Associated Press has the latest on the massive search.\n\nInvestigators trying to solve the mystery of a missing Malaysian jetliner received some belated help Tuesday from Thailand, whose military said it took 10 days to report radar blips that might have been the plane \"because we did not pay attention to it.\"\n\nA coalition of 26 countries, including Thailand, is looking for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which vanished March 8 with 239 people aboard on a night flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

We also need to see what routes the pilot had been assigned to before. This will take time, so people cannot jump the gun just yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cNEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK\u201d\n\nThailand said on Tuesday a re-examination of its military radar data had picked up the plane re-tracing its route across Peninsular Malaysia. The Thai military had previously said it had not detected any sign of the plane.\n\nWhat happened next is less certain. The plane may have flown for another six hours or more after dropping off Malaysian military radar about 200 miles northwest of Penang Island.\n\nBut the satellite signals that provide the only clues were not intended to work as locators. The best they can do is place the plane in one of two broad arcs \u2013 one stretching from Laos up to the Caspian, the other from west of Indonesia down to the Indian Ocean off Australia \u2013 when the last signal was picked up.\n\nMalaysia has asked countries along both corridors, as well as others with satellite capabilities, to re-examine their data to try to narrow the search area, Hishammuddin said.\n\nChina, which, with Kazakhstan, is leading the search in the northern corridor, said on Tuesday it had deployed 21 satellites to scour its territory.\n\n\u201cIn accordance with Malaysia\u2019s request, we are mobilizing satellites and radar to search over the Chinese section of the northern corridor, which the Malaysians say the plane may have flown over,\u201d said Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei.\n\nAustralia, which is leading the southernmost leg of the search, said it had shrunk its search field based on satellite tracking data and analysis of weather and currents, but that it still covered 600,000 sq km (230,000 sq miles).\n\n\u201cA needle in a haystack remains a good analogy,\u201d John Young, general manager of the emergency response division of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), told reporters.\n\n\u201cThe aircraft could have gone north or south, and if it went south, this is AMSA\u2019s best estimate of where we should look with the few resources we have at our disposal for such a search.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Navy was sending a P-8A Poseidon, its most advanced maritime surveillance aircraft, to Perth, in Western Australia, to assist with the search.\n\nThe disappearance of the plane was a major topic of conversation at the International Society of Transport Air Trading in San Diego, an annual gathering of 1,600 airplane makers, buyers and lessors.\n\n\u201cThe people that I deal with are looking at this with great concern \u2013 it appears considerable efforts may have gone into cloaking the aircraft,\u201d said Robert Agnew, chief executive of aviation consultants Morten Beyer & Agnew.\n\n(Additional reporting by A.

Cloud & rain limited visibility,\" AMSA said on its Twitter feed. \"Further aircraft to continue search for #MH370.\"\n\n\n\nThree more long-range surveillance planes -- one each from Australia, New Zealand and the United States -- were due to inspect the area where satellite images taken Sunday showed the two objects, one as large as 24 metres (79 feet) in size.\n\n\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told parliament the images represented \"new and credible information\" but stressed that any link with flight MH370 had still to be confirmed. Malaysia also said the information offered a \"credible lead\", but stressed it was too early to tell.\n\n\n\nThis \"requires us overnight to verify and corroborate it\", Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters in Kuala Lumpur, adding that the overall search and rescue effort would continue in the meantime.\n\n\n\nCurrently, there are 18 ships, 29 aircraft and six ship-borne helicopters deployed in the search along two corridors stretching from the southern Indian Ocean to Central Asia.\n\nNorwegian ship reaches area of suspected Malaysian plane debris\n\nA Norwegian ship on Thursday reached the Indian Ocean area where possible debris of the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 plane was spotted, shipping company Hoeeg Autoliners said.\n\n\n\n\"The ship has arrived at the site to take part in the search,\" said Cecilie Moe, spokeswoman for the Norwegian company.\n\n\n\nAccording to another Hooeg Autoliners spokesperson, Christian Dahll, the search window for Thursday was limited since sunset was at 1300 GMT.\n\n\n\nThe \"St. Petersburg\" vessel, a vehicles carrier, was on its way from Port Louis in Mauritius to the Australian city of Melbourne, when it was requested by the Australian authorities to reroute in order to identify the debris spotted by satellite in the southern Indian Ocean.\n\n\n\nAfter two weeks of false leads, Australia revived the investigation on the mysterious disappearance of flight MH370 when it announced the detection of two \"objects\" in the southern Indian Ocean, some 2,500km southwest of Perth in western Australia.\n\nSatellite images a \"credible lead\"\n\n\n\nMalaysia said on Thursday that two objects spotted by a satellite in the Indian Ocean were a \"credible lead\" in the search for a missing Malaysia Airlines passenger jet.\n\n\n\n\"We now have a credible lead,\" Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.\n\n\n\nThis \"requires us overnight to verify and corroborate it,\" Hishammuddin said, adding that the overall search and rescue effort for Flight 370 would continue in the meantime.\n\n\n\nCurrently, there are 18 ships, 29 aircraft and six ship-borne helicopters deployed in the search along two corridors stretching from the southern Indian Ocean to South and Central Asia.\n\n\n\n\"Until we are certain that we have located MH370, search and rescue operations will continue in both corridors,\" Hishammuddin said.\n\n\n\n\"For families around the world, the one piece of information they want most is the information we just don't have: the location of MH370,\" he added.\n\n\n\nEARLIER REPORT\n\nTwo objects possibly related to the search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 have been sighted, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said on Thursday in a potential breakthrough.\n\nAbbott told parliament \"new and credible information\" had come to light nearly two weeks after the plane vanished.\n\nImage courtesy Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA)\n\nHe said an Australian air force Orion had already been diverted to look into the objects with three more surveillance planes to follow. He did not specify where they were but Australia has taken charge of the search in the southern Indian Ocean.\n\n\"The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) has received information based on satellite information of objects possibly related to the search,\" Abbott said, adding that he had informed Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak.\n\n\"Following specialist analysis of this satellite imagery, two possible objects related to the search have been identified.\"\n\nBut he warned against drawing any premature conclusions.\n\n\"We must keep in mind the task of locating these objects will be extremely difficult and it may turn out that they are not related to the search for flight MH370,\" he said.\n\nAMSA was due to hold a news conference with more details at 0430 GMT.\n\nAuthorities in Kuala Lumpur on Monday asked Canberra to take responsibility for the \"southern vector\" of the operation to locate the Boeing 777, which disappeared on March 8 en route to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew on board.\n\nThe Malaysian government believes the jet was deliberately diverted and flew for several hours after leaving its scheduled flight path -- either north towards Central Asia, or towards the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nAustralian, US and New Zealand long-range surveillance planes have been scouring a vast tract of the southern Indian Ocean since Tuesday with the search focused on an area of 305,000 square kilometres (122,000 square miles), some 2,600 kilometres southeast of Perth.\n\n\n\nFBI help sought\n\nPresident Barack Obama designated the search for a missing Malaysian passenger jet a \"top priority\" for the United States as Malaysia shared evidence with the FBI and sought Thursday to pacify relatives' anger at the lack of progress.\n\nNearly two weeks after Malaysia Airlines flight 370 vanished with 239 passengers and crew on board, no concrete evidence has been uncovered to confirm what happened, who was responsible or -- most importantly -- where the aircraft ended up.\n\nIn his first on-camera comments on the mystery, Obama, who is due to visit Malaysia next month, offered thoughts and prayers to the anguished relatives of the missing passengers.\n\n\"I want them to be assured that we consider this a top priority,\" he said in a television interview at the White House.\n\nNearly two-thirds of those on board the Beijing-bound flight were Chinese, and there were chaotic, emotional scenes Wednesday when a handful of tearful Chinese relatives tried to gatecrash Malaysia's tightly controlled daily media briefing at a hotel near Kuala Lumpur airport.\n\nShouting and crying, the relatives unfurled a protest banner reading \"Give us back our families\", and accused the Malaysian authorities of withholding information and doing too little to find the plane.\n\nObama stressed there had been \"close cooperation\" with the Malaysian government and added that the United States had put \"every resource that we have available\" at the disposal of the search process.\n\nThere were three US nationals, including an infant, on board.\n\nData deleted\n\nA US official who spoke to AFP on condition of anonymity said Malaysia had asked the FBI to help recover data deleted from a flight simulator in the home of the missing plane's chief pilot, Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah.\n\nMalaysian police removed the simulator from Zaharie's home on Saturday, after investigators said they believed the Boeing 777 had been deliberately diverted from its intended route by someone on board.\n\nThe New York Times quoted a senior US law enforcement official as saying FBI agents in Kuala Lumpur would likely make copies of the simulator's hard drive and send the contents back to analysts in the United States who specialise in retrieval of deleted computer data.\n\n\"Right now, it's the best chance we have of finding something,\" that official said.\n\nZaharie, a 33-year veteran of the airline, was highly regarded by his peers. But suspicion has clouded him since investigators concluded the plane's communication systems were likely disabled manually and the aircraft diverted by a skilled aviator.\n\nBackground checks on the plane's 227 passengers have so far failed to uncover any relevant information.\n\nIn the days immediately after the jet vanished, FBI agents were reportedly kept at arm's length by Malaysian authorities.\n\nBut with the search area now encompassing vast tracts of land and sea equivalent to the entire land mass of Australia, Malaysia has sought the help of more than two dozen countries.\n\nAustralia said Wednesday that the search corridor in the southern Indian Ocean had been \"significantly refined\" following closer analysis of flight MH370's fuel reserves, and the Indian Navy said it had been given fresh search coordinates.\n\nScreaming relatives\n\nThere was a noticeably tighter security presence at the airport hotel where Wednesday's protest by angry Chinese relatives played out in front of the gathered international media.\n\nSeveral police officers guarded the entrance to the Sama Sama Hotel and new barriers were erected restricting access to the area around the briefing room.\n\nOne hotel official told AFP that police had briefed hotel security on preventing \"suspicious people\" from entering.\n\nWednesday's ugly scenes of screaming women being forcibly carried from the briefing room only compounded the pressure on the Malaysian authorities, who argue they are doing everything possible to resolve one of the biggest mysteries of the modern aviation era.\n\n\"I fully understand what they're going through. Emotions are high,\" said the minister of defence and transport, Hishammuddin Hussein.\n\nHe added that a \"high-level\" Malaysian team also would be sent to Beijing to deal with increasingly agitated relatives there.\n\nThe clock is ticking down on the 30 days during which the aircraft black box will transmit a signal.\n\nThe search has been hampered by the reluctance of some countries to share sensitive radar and satellite data, and to allow surveillance planes into their airspace.\n\nPeter Weeks, whose brother Paul, 39, was on the plane, said there had been no official communication from any government figures in Malaysia.\n\n\"The information we get is no better than what is in the media,\" he told CNN.\n\n\"You spend 24 hours a day thinking about it really; every waking moment and even the few moments of sleep you get.\n\n\"There's no solid information about anything,\" he said.\n\nLoss of Malaysia plane spurs calls to upload black box data to the 'cloud'\n\nThe disappearance of a Malaysian plane has prompted calls for in-flight streaming of black box data over remote areas, but industry executives say implementing changes may be complex and costly.\n\n\n\nMark Rosenker, former chairman of the US National Transportation Safety Board, said this incident and the 2009 loss of an Air France flight in the Atlantic should spur reforms in what he described an outdated accident investigation process.\n\n\n\nRosenker, a retired US Air Force general, said finding a way to transmit limited information from flight data and cockpit voice recorders to a virtual \"cloud\" database would help authorities launch accident investigations sooner and locate a plane if it got into trouble while out of reach of ground-based radars.\n\n\n\n\"This is the second accident in five years where we've had to wait to get the black boxes back,\" Rosenker said. \"We need to bring the concept of operations for accident investigations and the technology of what is available up to the 21st century.\"\n\n\n\nTwenty-six nations have been searching for the missing Boeing Co 777 airliner over an area roughly the size of Australia for 12 days, but the massive hunt has found no trace of any wreckage thus far.\n\n\n\nMary Kirby, editor of the aviation industry website Runway Girl Network, said airlines could use the growing number of broadband connections that allow passengers to access the Internet and download movies to provide real-time GPS data for just such emergencies.\n\n\n\n\"Airlines realize that this is the cost of doing business,\" she said. \"It is inexplicable to be bringing these big fat connectivity pipes to aircraft and yet to be in a situation in 2014 where you can lose a plane.\"\n\n\n\nCostly, challlenging change\n\n\n\nAviation experts and industry executives say it should be technically possible to stream flight recorder data to a database or a virtual \"cloud,\" but warned about broadband constraints and the high cost of equipping older airliners with new electronic equipment.\n\n\n\nThey say new satellite-based air traffic management systems being implemented in the United States, Asia and Europe in coming years will make it easier to track airplanes and monitor aircraft systems in flight, but note it will take a decade or more before the systems are commonplace worldwide.\n\n\n\nStreaming the huge amounts of data now collected by flight data recorders may also pose technical challenges, while transmission of cockpit voice recordings could raise privacy concerns, said analyst Richard Aboulafia with the Teal Group.\n\n\n\nRosenker, the former NTSB chief, said investigators could agree on a much smaller subset of key data to transmit, which would save bandwidth and cost. The data could even be sent at intervals instead of continuously streamed, he said.\n\n\n\nMost airplanes already have systems known as Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) that periodically report, either via VHF radio or satellite, on the performance of the aircraft and its engines, which could provide another possibility for getting data to investigators.\n\n\n\nOne industry executive said he fully expected reforms after this incident, but said airlines were more likely to increase the amount of data they were receiving from the existing ACARS system rather than opting to stream flight data.\n\n\n\n\"It would just be too costly. There are 93,000 flights a day, and we've had two incidents like this in four or five years,\" said the executive, who was not authorized to speak publicly since the search for the plane continues.\n\n\n\nBob Benzon, a former Air Force pilot and NTSB investigator, said it could potentially cost billions of dollars to allow every plane in the world to stream flight data, but mounting frustration over the failure to find any trace of Flight MH370 could well galvanize the aviation community into some action.\n\n\n\nHe said other potentially cheaper proposals included outfitting planes with floating locator or data recorder beacons that would automatically deploy if an airplane crashed.\n\n\n\n\"There's a tombstone mentality at times. You actually have to have a very tragic event to get things done,\" Benzon said. \"I predict that this is one of those events unfortunately.\"\n\n\n\nSome US military airplanes, including the Air Force's massive C-5 cargo planes, already have floating data recorders since they often fly over large spans of ocean.\n\n\n\nThe NTSB has recommended mandatory video recordings in the cockpit of commercial airliners, but has never recommended live-streaming or regular transmission of flight data.\n\n\n\nDiscussion about mandating regular transmissions from airliner black boxes increased after Air France Flight AF447 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009, its location and black boxes remaining a mystery until 22 months later.\n\n\n\nMoving black box to cloud\n\n\n\nThis time, investigators are beginning to think the plane may never be found, given the dearth of clues thus far.\n\n\n\nOliver McGee, a professor of mechanical engineering at Howard University and former senior U.S. Transportation Department official, said advances in technology made this an ideal time to change current procedures.\n\n\n\n\"It's time to move the black box to 'the cloud' at least for essential limited flight recorder data for long flights over (areas) like the Indian Ocean, or other remote areas across large land masses like across the Brazilian Amazon,\" he said.\n\n\n\nVictoria Day, spokeswoman for Airlines for America, which represents major U.S. carriers, said it was \"premature for us to speculate about potential changes to safety and security procedures.\"\n\n\n\nOfficials at Delta Air Lines, United and American Airlines also declined comment on the Malaysia Airlines case, and any consequences for the industry.\n\n\n\nIn the past, airlines have argued that such accidents are too rare to justify the added expense of streaming flight recorder data, but Rosenker said the cost needed to be weighed against the cost of the current search.\n\n\n\n\"Look at what's happening now. We've lost a 777 and over 200 people. Navies and airplanes from around the world are searching for this plane. That's not cheap either,\" he said.\n\nSearch appears deadlocked\n\n\n\nChinese relatives' anger over sparse information on the fate of their loved ones on board a missing Malaysian airliner sparked chaotic scenes on Wednesday at the headquarters of an increasingly deadlocked search operation.\n\n\n\nMalaysia's transport minister ordered an inquiry after security guards carried out the distraught mother of a passenger on Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 from a briefing room where she had protested about a lack of transparency, 12 days after the plane vanished.\n\n\n\n\"They are just saying wait for information. Wait for information. We don't know how long we have to wait,\" cried the woman before being whisked away from a massive media scrum.\n\n\n\nMinister Hishammuddin Hussein said he regretted the anguish.\"Malaysia is doing everything in its power to find MH370 and hopefully bring some degree of closure for those whose family members are missing,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\n\nProspects that a 26-nation operation would lead to quick results appeared to be dwindling, however, as investigators confirmed they were focusing on the remote southern Indian Ocean after failing to find any traces of the jet further north.\n\n\n\n\"Our top priority is being given to that area,\" Hishammuddin told the news conference, confirming an earlier Reuters report.\n\n\n\nNo wreckage has been found from Flight MH370, which vanished from air traffic control screens off Malaysia's east coast at 1:21 a.m. local time on March 8 (1721 GMT March 7), less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing.\n\n\n\nAn unprecedented search for the Boeing 777-200ER is under way in two vast search \"corridors\": one arcing north overland from Laos towards the Caspian Sea, the other curving south across the Indian Ocean from west of Indonesia's Sumatra island to west of Australia.\n\n\n\n\"The working assumption is that it went south, and furthermore that it went to the southern end of that corridor,\" said a source close to the investigation.\n\n\n\nThe view is based on the lack of any evidence from countries along the northern corridor that the plane entered their airspace, and the failure to find any trace of wreckage in searches in the upper part of the southern corridor.\n\n\n\nSome sources involved in the investigation have voiced fears it could be drifting towards deadlock due to the reluctance of countries in the region to share militarily sensitive radar data that might shed new light on the direction the jet took.\n\n\n\nTwo people familiar with the probe said the search had been hampered in some cases by delays over the paperwork needed to allow foreign maritime surveillance aircraft into territorial waters without a formal diplomatic request.\n\n\n\n\"These are basically spy planes; that's what they were designed for,\" said one source close to the investigation, explaining the hesitance of some nations to give blanket permission for other countries to scour their waters.\n\n\n\nHishammuddin confirmed that some assets that could be involved in the search were waiting for diplomatic clearance.\n\n\n\n\"The search for MH370 involves diplomatic, technical and logistical challenges,\" he told the news conference, held in a Kuala Lumpur airport hotel that has served as a temporary crisis coordination centre and a base for dozens of news organizations.\n\n\n\nMalaysia has come under the spotlight for its handling of the crisis, but insists it is directing smoothly what it believes to be the largest peacetime search and rescue effort.\n\n\n\nChina has called on Malaysia to speed up and expand the search operations during an episode that has tested relations between the peninsular nation and Asia's largest power.\n\n\n\nNEVER FOUND?\n\n\n\nMalaysian and U.S. officials believe the aircraft was deliberately diverted perhaps thousands of miles off course, but an exhaustive background search of the passengers and crew aboard has not yielded anything that might explain why.\n\n\n\nIf it did indeed end up in the southern Indian Ocean, one of the remotest places on Earth and also one of the deepest seas, it increases the chance it may never be found - and investigators may never know for sure what happened on board.\n\n\n\nHishammuddin said the difficulty of searching such a huge expanse of ocean made the operation in the southern corridor \"much more challenging\".\n\n\n\nOfficials believe that someone with detailed knowledge of both the Boeing 777 and commercial aviation navigation switched off two vital datalinks: the ACARS system, which relays maintenance data back to the ground, and the transponder, which enables the plane to be seen by civilian radar.\n\n\n\nThe source close to the investigation said that it was thought \"highly probable that ACARS was switched off prior to the final verbal message\" received for the cockpit.\n\n\n\nThat message, an informal \"all right, good night\" radioed to Malaysian air traffic controllers to acknowledge their handover of the plane to Vietnamese airspace, was believed to have been spoken by the co-pilot, the airline said earlier this week.\n\n\n\nInvestigators piecing together patchy data from military radar and satellites believe that minutes later the plane turned sharply west, re-crossing the Malay Peninsula and following an established commercial route towards India.\n\n\n\nAfter that, ephemeral pings picked up by one commercial satellite suggest the aircraft flew on for at least six hours. The data from the satellite placed the plane somewhere in one of the two corridors when the final signal was sent at 8:11 a.m.\n\n\n\nHishammuddin said the latest in a series of reported possible sightings of the plane, this time over the Maldives, had been investigated and had been determined to be untrue.\n\n\n\nFLIGHT SIMULATOR DATA DELETED\n\n\n\nThe methodical shutdown of the communications systems, together with the fact that the plane appeared to be following a planned course after turning back, have been interpreted as suggesting strongly that foul play, rather than some kind of technical failure, was behind the disappearance.\n\n\n\nPolice have searched the homes of the 53-year-old pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah and co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27. Among the items taken were a flight simulator Zaharie had built in his home.\n\n\n\nMalaysia's police chief, Khalid Abu Bakar, said an examination of the flight simulator showed its data log had been cleared on Feb. 3. \"The experts are looking at what are the logs that have been cleared,\" he told the news conference.\n\n\n\nU.S. and other security services have analysed passengers but have come up with no connections to terrorism or possible criminal motives, two sources close to the investigation said.\n\n\n\nMalaysian officials said all countries whose citizens were on the jet had run background checks except Ukraine and Russia.\n\nChina has said there is no evidence that Chinese passengers, who made up over two-thirds of those on board, were involved in a hijack or act of sabotage.\n\n\n\nAustralia is leading the search of the southern part of the southern corridor, with assistance from the U.S. Navy.\n\n\n\nIt has shrunk its search field based on satellite tracking data and analysis of weather and currents, but it still covers an area of 600,000 sq km (230,000 sq miles), roughly the size of Spain and Portugal.\n\n\n\nBecause of its size, scale of human loss and sheer uncertainty over what happened, the airliner looks set to establish itself as one of the most baffling transportation incidents of all time.\n\n\n\nA breakthrough is still possible, experts say. Wreckage could be found, although the more time elapses since the aircraft's disappearance, the more it will be scattered.\n\n\n\n\"It's a mystery and it may remain a mystery,\" said Elizabeth Quintalla of the Royal United Services Institute in London.\n\n\n\nEARLIER REPORT:\n\n'Data deleted' from pilot's simulator\n\nData was deleted from the home flight simulator used by the pilot of missing Malaysia Airlines flight 370 and investigators are working to recover it, a Malaysian official said on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nIn a daily press briefing, Hishammuddin Hussein, Malaysia's minister of transport and defence, also said background checks on all but three of the 239 passengers and crew on board the plane had produced no \"information of significance\".\n\n\n\nMH370 went missing early on March 8 with 239 passengers and crew, spawning a massive international search across Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean.\n\n\n\nPolice had removed the simulator from Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah's home last Saturday, after it became clear that the aircraft had likely been deliberately diverted by someone on board.\n\n\n\n\"Some data had been deleted from the simulator and forensic work to retrieve this data is ongoing,\" Hishammuddin said, stressing that no evidence had been found implicating Zaharie in any wrongdoing.\n\n\n\nThe minister also announced that Malaysia had received the results of passenger background checks from all countries with citizens on board -- apart from Ukraine and Russia.\n\n\n\n\"So far no information of significance on any passengers has been found.\" he said.\n\n\n\nThere were two Ukrainians and one Russian on the plane.\n\nWhy did passengers not use mobiles? New clues\n\nIn the age of smartphones and social media, one question surrounding the disappearance of the Malaysian airliner is why none of the passengers tried to contact relatives.\n\nEven the absence of phone calls or emails from those on board the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 could provide clues for investigators struggling to solve one of the greatest mysteries of modern aviation. It may indicate that the plane was flying too high or was over water, or that the passengers were unconscious, possibly due to a change in cabin pressure.\n\nExperts say the chances of the 239 people on board Flight 370 being able to use their mobile devices would have been better the closer they were to a mobile network on the ground.\n\nMissing Malaysian plane assumed in southern Indian Ocean: source\n\n\n\nInvestigators examining the March 8 disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines plane with 239 people aboard believe it most likely that the plane flew into the southern Indian Ocean, a source close to the investigation said on Wednesday.\n\n\"The working assumption is that it went south, and furthermore that it went to the southern end of that corridor,\" said the source, referring to a search area stretching from west of Indonesia to the Indian Ocean west of Australia.\n\nSightings\n\nPolice in the Maldives are probing reports that islanders in the tourism paradise saw a \"low-flying jumbo jet\" on the day the missing Malaysia Airlines plane vanished.\n\nIn a statement released late Tuesday, police said they were investigating a report on the Haveeru news website that local residents had spotted a large plane flying over the remote southern island of Kuda Huvadhoo on March 8.\n\n\"The police are looking into the reports in the media saying that a low-flying airplane was sighted above Kuda Huvadhoo,\" the statement said.\n\nIndian techie's radar claim\n\nIndia has blown hot and then cold in the search for the missing Malaysian Airlines flight, with one of the suspected corridors of the diverted plane\u2019s flight path said to be the southern Indian ocean.\n\nMedia reports have now emerged that an Indian IT analyst, Anoop Madhav Yeggina taking part in the crowd sourcing search for the missing plane \u2013 involving millions of people \u2013 claimed to have seen a radar image of a plane flying very low above the Andaman Islands.\n\nYeggina was looking through innumerable images of DigitalGlobe Satellite QB02 when he stumbled upon the image.\n\nHe has since uploaded his \u201cdiscovery\u201d along with a write-up on the CNN website.\n\nHowever, at least one website has reported that scientists have debunked Yeggina\u2019s claim.\n\nNews site 3news reported that the image which Yeggina claims shows a plane the colour and size of a Boeing 777 that appeared to be flying low to the ground not far from an airstrip controlled by the Indian Navy was outdated.\n\nThe image he had used was from a base layer of the map, which dated back to at least 2012. This was confirmed on Twitter by Mapbox Chief Scientist Bruno S\u00e1nchez-Andrade Nu\u00f1o.\n\n\n\nMilitary radar\n\nThailand's military said Tuesday that its radar detected a plane that may have been Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 just minutes after the jetliner's communications went down, and that it didn't share the information with Malaysia earlier because it wasn't specifically asked for it.\n\nA twisting flight path described Tuesday by Thai air force spokesman Air Vice Marshal Montol Suchookorn took the plane to the Strait of Malacca, which is where Malaysian radar tracked Flight 370 early March 8. But Montol said the Thai military doesn't know whether it detected the same plane.\n\nThailand's failure to quickly share possible information regarding the fate of the plane, and the 239 people aboard it, may not substantially change what Malaysian officials know, but it raises questions about the degree to which some countries are sharing their defense information, even in the name of an urgent and mind-bending aviation mystery.\n\nWith only its own radar to go on, it took Malaysia a week to confirm that Flight 370 had entered the strait, an important detail that led it to change its search strategy.\n\nWhen asked why it took so long to release the information, Montol said, \"Because we did not pay any attention to it. The Royal Thai Air Force only looks after any threats against our country, so anything that did not look like a threat to us, we simply look at it without taking actions.\"\n\nHe said the plane never entered Thai airspace and that Malaysia's initial request for information in the early days of the search was not specific.\n\n\"When they asked again and there was new information and assumptions from (Malaysian) Prime Minister Najib Razak, we took a look at our information again,\" Montol said. \"It didn't take long for us to figure out, although it did take some experts to find out about it.\"\n\nFlight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur at 12:40 am. Malaysian time and its transponder, which allows air traffic controllers to identify and track the airplane, ceased communicating at 1:20 am.\n\nMontol said that at 1:28 am, Thai military radar \"was able to detect a signal, which was not a normal signal, of a plane flying in the direction opposite from the MH370 plane,\" back toward Kuala Lumpur. The plane later turned right, toward Butterworth, a Malaysian city along the Strait of Malacca.\n\nThe radar signal was infrequent and did not include any data such as the flight number.\n\nHe said he didn't know exactly when Thai radar last detected the plane. Malaysian officials have said Flight 370 was last detected by their own military radar at 2:14 am.\n\nAs big as Australia\n\nMalaysia on Tuesday said the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines passenger jet now encompassed an area slightly larger than the entire land mass of Australia.\n\n\n\n\"The entire search area is now 2.24 million square nautical miles (7.7 million square kilometres),\" acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said in a daily press briefing on Tuesday evening.\n\n\n\nAustralia has a land mass of around 7.6 million square kilometres.\n\n\n\nThe search area extends north into south central Asia, passing across far western China, including Xinjiang and Tibet, as well as south deep into the Indian Ocean west of Australia.\n\n\n\n\"This is an enormous search area. And it is something that Malaysia cannot possibly search on its own,\" Hishammuddin said.\n\n\n\n\"I am therefore very pleased that so many countries have come forward to offer assistance and support to the search and rescue operation.\"\n\n\n\n26 countries have deployed dozens of aircraft to search for the missing Beijing-bound jet that went missing in the early hours of March 8.\n\n\n\nEleven days after contact was lost with the aircraft and its 239 passengers and crew, there has been minimal progress in determining precisely what happened or where the plane ended up.\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Najib Razak said on Saturday satellite data showed the plane had been deliberately diverted after it lost contact with ground controllers.\n\nAFP\n\nOne is a technical wizard whose affable manner made him a favourite of trainee pilots; the other an enthusiastic young aviator planning to marry his sweetheart.\n\n\n\nThe captain and co-pilot of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 are now at the centre of a baffling paradox: as circumstantial evidence mounts that at least one of them may have been involved in the plane's disappearance on March 8, accounts of their lives portray them as sociable, well-balanced and happy.\n\n\n\nDescribed as devoted to their families and communities, neither fits the profile of a loner or extremist who might have a motive for suicide, hijacking or terrorism.\n\n\n\nInternational media scrutiny and investigations by the Malaysian police have failed to turn up red flags on either the captain, 53-year-old grandfather Zaharie Ahmad Shah, or the co-pilot, 27-year old Fariq Abdul Hamid.\n\n\n\nBoth live in well-to-do neighbourhoods in Shah Alam, an area west of Kuala Lumpur that is popular among flight crews for its proximity to the international airport. On Tuesday, security guards prevented reporters from entering Zaharie's upscale gated residence. About 10 minutes' drive away, Fariq's house stood empty, with an unread newspaper lying outside.\n\n\n\nFamily and friends say there is nothing in their personalities or past to suggest they would have committed foul play.\n\n\n\n\"I've never seen him lose his temper. It's difficult to believe any of the speculation made against him,\" said Peter Chong, a friend of Zaharie, describing him as highly disciplined and conscientious.\n\n\n\nEleven days after the Boeing 777 jetliner carrying 239 people vanished without trace, scrutiny has zeroed in on the pilots due to the deliberate way in which the plane was switched into radar darkness and diverted far from its route to Beijing.\n\n\n\nThe person who chose that exact time and place to vanish appears to have acted only after meticulous planning and must have had advanced aviation knowledge, according to experts.\n\n\n\n\"It raises so many questions, not least that you have got to be prepared to believe that a pilot would do this,\" said Paul Hayes, a leading air safety expert at UK-based consultancy, Flightglobal Ascend.\n\n\n\n\"But it is hard to understand the motive. In cases where pilot suicide was thought to be the cause, the alleged suicide pilots executed the plan as soon as they were in a position to do so.\"\n\n\n\nA HANDYMAN WITH POLITICAL PASSIONS\n\n\n\nLacking other explanations, focus has turned to what would otherwise be seen as innocent passions in Zaharie's life - a desire to vote out Malaysia's long-ruling government, and an extreme enthusiasm for flying planes and fixing gadgets.\n\n\n\nZaharie, a balding father of three who likes to cook, appears to have undergone a social-media awakening in early 2013 when he began posting video of himself on YouTube, dispensing tips on how to fix refrigerators and tweak air conditioners.\n\n\n\nAfter signing up to YouTube in January 2013, the man described by friends as a moderate Muslim watched clips on God and atheism and speeches by Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim. He joined Anwar's party the same month, and helped campaign for elections in May 2013 that were narrowly won by the ruling coalition and afterwards disputed by the opposition.\n\n\n\n\"There is a rebel in each and everyone of us...let it out!\" Zaharie wrote on Facebook in the weeks after the election as Anwar led nationwide rallies to challenge the result.\n\n\n\nAbout six hours before Flight MH370 took off, Anwar was convicted and sentenced to five years' jail for sodomy, a ruling widely condemned as politically motivated.\n\n\n\nThat has sparked speculation that Zaharie, perhaps enraged by the setback for his political idol, could have brought down the plane as a form of protest or out of despair.\n\n\n\nBut his passion to see Malaysia's first change of government in 56 years was shared by millions in the country and the opposition is a democratic movement with no links to extremist groups. There is no evidence he attended Anwar's trial, as some media reported. He still lived with his wife, despite other reports they were breaking up.\n\n\n\n\"He was a disciplined person,\" said Chong, who said he first met Zaharie two years ago when he saw him tidying chairs after a community event.\n\n\n\n\"Since 9\/11, I believe they are not even allowed to open the cockpit door even under duress. The captain Zaharie that I know would be the kind of person who would strictly stick to that.\"\n\n\n\nZaharie made no secret of his obsession with aviation, which ranged from flying model aeroplanes to setting up a multi-screen flight simulator at home, which he also showed off on YouTube. Police have seized the machine and are examining its contents, but say they have yet to find anything suspicious.\n\n\n\nA fellow Malaysia Airlines pilot, who declined to be identified, described Zaharie as a \"decent and approachable man\" who was sought out by less experienced pilots to observe their final training runs, a procedure known as line checks.\n\n\n\n\"Younger pilots would seek him for their line checks because he was easy to talk to,\" the pilot said.\n\n\n\nNeighbours who know Fariq, the son of a senior civil servant, told Reuters he is known as a good and pious man who was a regular worshipper at a mosque a few minutes walk from his house. Relatives said he was a diligent student who loved his job, having recently qualified to fly the wide-body 777 jet.\n\n\n\nThere has been no suggestion he had extremist views or serious personal problems, although he came under fire after the plane's disappearance when it emerged he had allowed two women into the cockpit on a 2011 flight.\n\n\n\nFariq, who officials believe uttered the final words \"all right, goodnight\" from the cockpit, had been expected to propose this year to his girlfriend Nadira Ramli, who was a co-pilot for budget carrier AirAsia.\n\n\n\n\"It was a matter of time before they got married,\" said a relative of the fresh-faced Fariq who asked not to be identified. \"Police investigating the suicide theory is upsetting to the family. Why would he even do that? He had a good life and he had Nadira.\"\n\nChina has 21 satellites looking for missing Malaysian jet\n\n\n\nChina said on Tuesday that it has deployed 21 satellites to search for the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner with 239 people on board.\n\n\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei made the comments at a daily news briefing.\n\n\n\nChina has begun searching for the missing jet in those parts of its own territory covered by a northern corridor that the aircraft could have flown through, state media said earlier in the day.\n\n\n\nNo trace of the plane has been found more than a week after it vanished, but investigators believe it was diverted by someone with deep knowledge of the plane and commercial navigation.\n\n\n\nThailand shares radar data on plane that might be Flight 370\n\nThailand's military said on Tuesday that its radar detected a plane that may have been Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 just minutes after the jetliner's communications went down, and that it didn't share the information with Malaysia earlier because it wasn't specifically asked for it.\n\n\n\nA twisting flight path described on Tuesday by Thai air force spokesman Air Vice Marshal Montol Suchookorn took the plane to the Strait of Malacca, which is where Malaysian radar tracked Flight 370 early March 8. But Montol said the Thai military doesn't know whether it detected the same plane.\n\n\n\nThailand's failure to quickly share possible information regarding the fate of the plane, and the 239 people aboard it, may not substantially change what Malaysian officials know, but it raises questions about the degree to which some countries are sharing their defence information, even in the name of an urgent and mind-bending aviation mystery.\n\n\n\nWith only its own radar to go on, it took Malaysia a week to confirm that Flight 370 had entered the strait, an important detail that led it to change its search strategy.\n\n\n\nWhen asked why it took so long to release the information, Montol said, \"Because we did not pay any attention to it. The Royal Thai Air Force only looks after any threats against our country, so anything that did not look like a threat to us, we simply look at it without taking actions.\"\n\n\n\nHe said the plane never entered Thai airspace and that Malaysia's initial request for information in the early days of the search was not specific.\n\n\n\n\"When they asked again and there was new information and assumptions from (Malaysian) Prime Minister Najib Razak, we took a look at our information again,\" Montol said. \"It didn't take long for us to figure out, although it did take some experts to find out about it.\"\n\n\n\nFlight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur at 12:40 a.m. Malaysian time and its transponder, which allows air traffic controllers to identify and track the airplane, ceased communicating at 1:20 a.m.\n\n\n\nMontol said that at 1:28 a.m., Thai military radar \"was able to detect a signal, which was not a normal signal, of a plane flying in the direction opposite from the MH370 plane,\" back toward Kuala Lumpur. The plane later turned right, toward Butterworth, a Malaysian city along the Strait of Malacca. The radar signal was infrequent and did not include any data such as the flight number.\n\n\n\nHe said he didn't know exactly when Thai radar last detected the plane. Malaysian officials have said Flight 370 was last detected by their own military radar at 2:14 a.m.\n\n\n\nThe search area for the plane initially focused on the South China Sea, where ships and planes spent a week searching. Pings that a satellite detected from the plane hours after its communications went down have led authorities to concentrate instead on two vast arcs \u2014 one into central Asia and the other into the Indian Ocean \u2014 that together cover an expanse as big as Australia.\n\n\n\nThai officials said radar equipment in southern Thailand detected the plane. Malaysian officials have said the plane might ultimately have passed through northern Thailand, but Thai Air Chief Marshal Prajin Juntong told reporters Tuesday that the country's northern radar did not detect it.\n\n\n\nNo evidence linking 153 Chinese passengers aboard to terror or hijacking\n\nIntelligence checks on 153 Chinese passengers on a missing Malaysian airliner produced no red flags, China said Tuesday, as Malaysia marshalled ships and planes from 26 countries to search an area the size of Australia.\n\nEleven days after contact was lost with Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and its 239 passengers and crew, there has been minimal progress in determining precisely what happened or where the plane ended up.\n\nLending fresh weight to the belief that the plane was deliberately diverted, the New York Times reported that the first turn it made off its flight path was programmed into the Boeing 777's computer navigation system, probably by someone in the cockpit.\n\nRather than manually operating the plane's controls, whoever altered Flight 370's path typed seven or eight keystrokes into a computer situated between the captain and the co-pilot, the newspaper said, quoting US officials.\n\nThe head of Malaysia Airlines, Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, said he was unable to confirm the report.\n\n\"The aircraft was programmed to fly to Beijing ... (but) once you are in the aircraft, anything is possible,\" he told a daily press briefing.\n\nTwo thirds of those on board were Chinese, and Malaysia had asked authorities in Beijing to run an exhaustive background check on all their nationals as part of a probe into everyone aboard.\n\nParticular attention was paid to a passenger from China's Muslim ethnic Uighur minority.\n\nOn Tuesday China's ambassador to Malaysia Huang Huikang said no evidence had been found that would link anyone to a possible hijacking or terrorist attack on the jet.\n\n- China criticism -The current search area, which was only properly identified after a week of fruitlessly scouring the South China Sea, is enormous -- stretching from the depths of the Indian Ocean, up and over the Himalayas and into central Asia.\n\nTransport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said it covered a total of 2.24 million square nautical miles (7.7 million square kilometres) -- slightly larger than Australia.\n\nChina's state media has been vocally critical of Malaysia's handling of the investigation, saying valuable time and resources were wasted in the hours and days immediately after the aircraft disappeared on March 8.\n\nDesperate relatives of the Chinese passengers threatened to go on hunger strike Tuesday, demanding that Malaysia's ambassador brief them in person.\n\nMalaysian officials insist they are investigating all the passengers and crew, but for the moment the focus is clearly on the two pilots -- Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah and First Officer Fariq Abdul Hamid.\n\nOn Monday Ahmad Jauhari revealed that the last recorded words from the cockpit -- \"All right, good night\" -- were almost certainly spoken by the co-pilot, Fariq.\n\nThe identity was deemed important given that the final message came around the time the plane's two automated signalling systems were disabled and it veered off course just as it was being handed over from Malaysian to Vietnamese air traffic control.\n\nDespite some confusion about when the systems were switched off, Hishammuddin stressed that investigators still believe the series of events were consistent with \"deliberate action\" by someone on the plane.\n\nThe nonchalant style of the verbal sign-off had been queried in some quarters, but a Boeing 777 pilot told AFP it was \"completely normal\" for a pilot leaving his domestic air space.\n\nPolice have searched both pilots' homes and are examining a flight simulator that Captain Zaharie, 53, had assembled at his home.\n\nMalaysian media reported that Zaharie was distantly related to the daughter-in-law of opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, aas well as being a member of his political party.\n\nAnwar said Tuesday he was \"disgusted\" by the suggestion the plane may have been sabotaged as an act of revenge hours after he was convicted on a sodomy charge widely seen as politically motivated.\n\nHishammuddin said the search for the missing aircraft should remain \"above politics\".\n\n- No idea of location -Twenty-six countries are now involved in that search in a northern corridor over south and central Asia, and a southern corridor stretching deep into the southern Indian Ocean towards Australia.\n\nA French expert who took part in the search for Air France Flight 447, which crashed in the Atlantic in 2009, said finding the Malaysian plane was a much tougher proposition.\n\n\"Here we simply have no idea of the location of the aircraft, because there were no ACARS signals,\" said Jean-Paul Troadec, a special adviser with France's civil aviation accident investigation agency.\n\nMalaysia has deployed its navy and air force to the southern corridor, where Australia is taking the lead in scouring a huge section of ocean off its west coast.\n\n\"It will take at least a few weeks to search the area thoroughly,\" said John Young of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority.\n\nThe US Pacific Fleet withdrew a guided missile destroyer, saying the area was simply too big for such a vessel to make an effective contribution.\n\n\"The Indian Ocean goes so far, there probably aren't enough ships and aircraft in the world to search every inch of it,\" Fleet spokesman Commander William Marks told CNN.\n\nSearch begins on Chinese territory; Diversion programmed into cockpit\n\nChinese state media say search begins on Chinese territory for missing Malaysian jet .\n\n\n\nChina said on Tuesday that it has deployed 21 satellites to search for the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner with 239 people on board.\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei made the comments at a daily news briefing.\n\nDiversion programmed\n\nThe turn that diverted the missing Malaysian Airlines plane off its flight path was programmed into the aircraft's computer navigation system, probably by someone in the cockpit, the New York Times reported late Monday.\n\nThat reinforces the increasing belief among investigators that the aircraft was deliberately diverted, the newspaper said, quoting US officials.\n\nAustralia's maritime safety agency said on Tuesday it had sharply reduced its search for the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner to a 600,000 sqkm (230,000 sqmile) corridor in the southern Indian Ocean, but that is still roughly the size of Spain and Portugal combined.\n\nStrong currents and high seas are making the task more daunting, it said.\n\nIn the northern hemisphere, a separate search area is along an arc stretching from Malaysia through northern Thailand, Myanmar and China to Kazakhstan.\n\nChinese passengers cleared: China\n\nNo evidence has been found linking the 153 Chinese passengers aboard the missing Malaysia Airlines flight to terror or hijacking, state media said Tuesday, citing Beijing's envoy in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates Armed Forces is taking part in the search operations for the Malaysian Airlines passenger plane, which went missing10 days ago, a source at the General Headquarters of the Armed Forces has said.\n\nThe source added that the UAE Armed Forces is using two search and rescue aircraft in the search operations, which cover a zone stretching south over the Indian Ocean to Australia and north over an area extending to the south and central Asia. There are 26 countries currently involved in the search operations.\n\nThe Malaysia Airlines plane went missing on March 8 while flying over the South East Asia and the Indian Ocean with 239 passengers onboard, leading to a massive international search operation.\n\nMalaysia Airlines flight diverted by person with deep knowledge of plane, commercial navigation\n\nInvestigators believe it was diverted by someone with deep knowledge of the plane and commercial navigation.\n\nMalaysia must \"immediately\" expand and clarify the scope of the search for a Malaysia Airlines jetliner that disappeared with 239 people on board, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Monday in a statement posted on its website.\n\nMeanwhile, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said at a regular briefing in Beijing that China's ambassador to Malaysia met Malaysia's foreign minister on Monday.\n\nEngineer suspect\n\nMalaysian police are investigating a flight engineer who was among the passengers on the missing Malaysia Airlines plane as they focus on the pilots and anyone else on board who had technical flying knowledge, a senior police official said.\n\nThe aviation engineer is Mohd Khairul Amri Selamat, 29, a Malaysian who has said on social media he had worked for a private jet charter company.\n\nHistoric satellite search\n\nFinding a missing Malaysia Airlines plane may hinge on whether searchers can narrow down where they need to look using satellite data that is inexact and has never been used for that purpose before, search and rescue experts say.\n\nAuthorities now believe someone on board the Boeing 777 shut down part of the aircraft's messaging system about the same time the plane with 239 people on board disappeared from civilian radar.\n\nBut an Inmarsat satellite was able to automatically connect with a portion of the messaging system that remained in operation, similar to a phone call that just rings because no one is on the other end to pick it up and provide information.\n\nNo location information was exchanged, but the satellite continued to identify the plane once an hour for four to five hours after it disappeared from radar screens.\n\nBased on the hourly connections with the plane, described by a US official as a \"handshake,\" the satellite knows at what angle to tilt its antenna to be ready to receive a message from the plane should one be sent.\n\nUsing that antenna angle, along with radar data, investigators have been able to draw two vast arcs, or \"corridors\" \u2014 a northern one from northern Thailand through to the border of the Central Asian countries Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, and a southern one from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nThe plane is believed to be somewhere along those arcs.\n\nAir crash investigators have never used this kind of satellite data before to try to find a missing plane, but after pursing other leads it's the best clue left.\n\n\"The people that are doing this are thinking outside the box. They're using something that wasn't designed to be used this way, and it seems to be working,\" said William Waldock, who teaches accident investigation at the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Arizona.\n\n\"In terms of search and rescue, they're probably going to have rewrite the book after this.\"\n\n25 countries, 43 ships, 58 aircraft\n\nAuthorities generally believe the plane crashed into the ocean, although they can't rule out the possibility that it may be on land somewhere.\n\nTwenty-five countries are involved in the search for the plane, using at least 43 ships and 58 aircraft.\n\n\"If it really is out there in the Indian Ocean, they're going to need a lot more than that,\" Waldock said.\n\n\"It's immense. It takes a lot of effort, a lot of people, a lot of ships and airplanes.\"\n\nIn order to narrow down the location, low-flying planes are searching broad swathes of water for any sign of debris.\n\nThe search is complicated by the vast amount of trash floating in the world's oceans.\n\nIf the airliner did crash into the ocean, some lighter-weight items such as insulation, seat cushions, and life jackets, as well as bodies not strapped to seats, are likely to be floating on the surface, Waldock said.\n\nThe heavier parts of the plane would sink, with depths in some parts of the Indian Ocean at over 15,000 feet(4,570 meters), he said.\n\nWhen suspected debris of a plane is found, the nearest ship \u2014 whether it's a search ship or a commercial vessel that happens to be in the area \u2014 is sent to the site.\n\nA small boat or life raft usually has to be lowered into the water for a closer look at the debris to judge whether it might have come from the missing plane.\n\nIf searchers find airplane debris, ocean currents will have already moved away from where the plane went into the water.\n\nSearchers will then have to use their knowledge of currents in the region to estimate how far and from what direction the debris came, and work backward to that location.\n\nThe airliner is equipped with two \"black boxes\" \u2014 a flight data recorder that contains hundreds of types of information on how the plane was functioning, and cockpit voice recorder that contains pilots' conversations and noise in the cockpit. Both are equipped with underwater locator beacons, sometimes called \"pingers,\" that emit a sonic signal that can only be heard underwater. Sonar on ships can sometimes pick up the pings, but they are best heard using a special pinger locator device that is lowered into the water.\n\nThe US Navy in the Indian Ocean region has a pinger locator. \"It's boxed up, it's ready to be sent somewhere,\" said a US official. \"Right now, there just isn't enough evidence to tell us where to send it.\"\n\nThe official agreed to speak only on condition anonymity because he wasn't authorised to speak publicly.\n\nGlobal call\n\nMalaysia has appealed for help and international coordination in a search for its missing passenger jet that stretches across two corridors from the Caspian Sea to the southern Indian Ocean, diplomats said on Sunday.\n\nMalaysian officials briefed envoys from 22 countries on the progress of the investigation after calling off a search in the South China Sea for the jet that vanished from radar screens more than a week ago, with 239 people on board.\n\nAlthough countries have been coordinating individually, the broad formal request at a meeting of ambassadors marked a new diplomatic phase in a search operation thought increasingly likely to rely on the sharing of sensitive material such as military radar data.\n\n\"The meeting was for us to know exactly what is happening and what sort of help they need. It is more for them to tell us, 'please put in all your resources',\" T.S. Tirumurti, India's high commissioner to Malaysia, told Reuters.\n\nThe diplomatic initiative could become significant as nations ponder whether to share any military data on the Boeing 777's fate, and fills a void left by the failure of Southeast Asian nations to work as a bloc on the crisis, a diplomat said.\n\n\"There are clearly limits to military data,\" the diplomat said, adding that nations were nonetheless aware of the strong public interest in cooperation on a civilian issue.\n\nMalaysian Defence Minister and Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said Malaysia had itself fed the findings of its own military radar tracks into what is now a domestic criminal enquiry into suspected hijacking or sabotage.\n\nHe declined to say whether Kuala Lumpur had asked others to open up their military radar tracks, but told a news conference that it had asked for both primary and secondary radar data.\n\nExperts say military forces mainly use primary or classic radar, which works by listening for its own echo bouncing back off a potentially unfriendly object.\n\nCivil air traffic control mostly uses secondary radar, which relies on hearing a signal sent back from the aircraft's transponder along with data designed to identify the plane.\n\nIt was the apparently deliberate decision to turn the jet's transponder off that left Malaysian authorities relying on the blips picked up by primary military radar to form the theory that the aircraft - on a flight to Beijing - had turned back west before disappearing.\n\nUnderscoring the caution surrounding the request for deeper co-operation, at least one country represented at Sunday's ambassadorial meeting asked Malaysia to supply its request in writing, a diplomat present at the talks said.\n\nSoutheast Asia has been at the centre of a regional arms race for several years amid tensions in the South China Sea, with maritime surveillance and air defences high on the list of hardware laid out at last month's Singapore Airshow.\n\nThe search for the missing jet is focusing on a wide stripe of territory either side of two arcs formed by satellite plots of the aircraft's last known possible position.\n\nThe northernmost of these stretches runs north through Thailand and China and bends towards India, Pakistan and then Central Asia, over some of the world's most strongly guarded defences.\n\nIf the jet did stray into those areas, sensitivities over whether and how such sensitive data could be shared could be further complicated by potential embarrassment over how such a large unidentified aircraft could have continued unchallenged.\n\nDefense analysts said on Saturday that the jet's disappearance raised awkward questions about the strength of regional or even global air defences.\n\nPilot's home flight simulator examined\n\nMalaysia said on Sunday that police had searched the homes of the pilots of a missing jet and examined a home flight simulator after revelations that the flight was deliberately diverted triggered a full-scale criminal probe.\n\nMalaysian police say they are investigating engineers who might have had contact with plane.\n\nInvestigators probing the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines MH370 piloted an identical Boeing 777-200 on the missing plane's suspected flight path, in a re-enactment confirming their belief that it banked west, a senior Malaysian military official said Sunday.\n\nPolice are combing through the personal, political and religious backgrounds of pilots and crew of a missing Malaysian jetliner, a senior officer said on Sunday, trying to work out why someone aboard flew the plane hundreds of miles off course.\n\nNo trace of the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777-200ER has been found since it vanished on March 8 with 239 people on board, but investigators believe it was diverted by someone who knew how to switch off its communications and tracking systems.\n\n\"We are not ruling out any sort of motivation at the moment,\" a senior police official with knowledge of the investigation told Reuters.\n\nIndia suspends search\n\nIndia on Sunday suspended its search for Malaysia Airlines flight 370 around the remote Andaman and Nicobar Islands and in the Bay of Bengal and are awaiting fresh instructions from Malaysia, a defence official said.\n\n\"The entire operation is on hold for now. We are awaiting fresh instructions from Malaysia. Nothing came out of the search in designated areas on Saturday,\" said Colonel Harmit Singh, spokesman for India's army, navy and airforce command in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\n\nIndian radar may have been turned off at night.\n\nWhatever truly happened to missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, its apparently unchallenged wanderings through Asian skies point to major gaps in regional - and perhaps wider - air defences.\n\nMore than a decade after Al Qaeda hijackers turned airliners into weapons on Sept 11, 2001, a large commercial aircraft completely devoid of stealth features appeared to vanish with relative ease.\n\nOn Saturday, Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak said authorities now believed the Boeing 777 flew for nearly seven hours after disappearing early on March 8. Either its crew or someone else on the plane disabled the on-board transponder civilian air traffic radar used to track it, investigators believe.\n\nIt appears to have first flown back across the South China Sea - an area of considerable geopolitical tension and military activity - before overflying northern Malaysia and then heading out towards India without any alarm being raised.\n\nThe reality, analysts and officials say, is that much of the airspace over water - and in many cases over land - lacks sophisticated or properly monitored radar coverage.\n\nAnalysts say the gaps in Southeast Asia's air defences are likely to be mirrored in other parts of the developing world, and may be much greater in areas with considerably lower geopolitical tensions.\n\n\"Several nations will be embarrassed by how easy it is to trespass their airspace,\" said Air Vice Marshal Michael Harwood, a retired British Royal Air Force pilot and ex-defence attache to Washington DC. \"Too many movies and Predator (unmanned military drone) feeds from Afghanistan have suckered people into thinking we know everything and see everything. You get what you pay for. And the world, by and large, does not pay.\"\n\nNOTHING MUCH HAPPENS AT NIGHT\n\nInvestigators now say they believe MH370 may have turned either towards India and Central Asia or - perhaps more likely, given the lack of detection - taken a southern course towards the Antarctic. That would have been an effectively suicidal flight, the aircraft eventually running out of fuel and crashing.\n\nThe waters of the southern Indian Ocean and northern Southern Ocean are among the most remote on the planet, used by few ships and overflown by few aircraft.\n\nAustralian civilian radar extends only some 200 km (125 miles) from its coast, an Australian official said on condition of anonymity, although its air defence radar extends much further. Australia's military could not be reached for comment on Saturday and if it did detect a transponder-less aircraft heading south, there is no suggestion any alarm was raised.\n\nUS military satellites monitor much of the globe, including some of the remotest oceans, looking primarily for early warning of any ballistic missile launch from a submarine or other vessel.\n\nAfter the aircraft's initial disappearance a week ago, US officials said their satellites had detected no signs of a mid-air explosion. It is unclear if such systems would have detected a crash landing in the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nOn India's Andaman Islands, a defence official told reporters he saw nothing unusual or out of place in the lack of permanent radar coverage. The threat in the area, he said, was much lower than on India's border with Pakistan where sophisticated radars are manned and online continuously.\n\nAt night in particular, he said, \"nothing much happens\".\n\n\"We have our radars, we use them, we train with them, but it's not a place where we have (much) to watch out for,\" he said. \"My take is that this is a pretty peaceful place.\"\n\nPilot's home searched\n\nPolice began searching the home of the pilot of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight on Saturday, after the country's prime minister confirmed the plane was suspected to have been deliberately diverted, a senior police official told Reuters.\n\nPrime Minister Najib Razak's statement confirmed days of mounting speculation that the disappearance of the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 was not accidental, and underlines the massive task for searchers who have been scouring vast areas of ocean.\n\n\"In view of this latest development, the Malaysian authorities have refocused their investigation into the crew and passengers on board,\" Najib said, stressing they were still investigating all possibilities as to why the plane deviated so drastically from its original flight path.\n\nMalaysia's leader Saturday said communications aboard a missing jet were switched off and its course deliberately changed by someone on board before the aircraft disappeared a week ago, but stopped short of saying it had been hijacked.\n\nFinal satellite communication with the Boeing 777 flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing came more than six-and-a-half hours after it vanished from civilian radar at 1:30am on March 8, Prime Minister Najib Razak told a nationally televised press conference.\n\nThe movement of the plane in the interim period, during which it changed direction and passed back over the Malaysian peninsula towards the Indian Ocean, was \"consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane,\" Najib said.\n\n\"Despite media reports that the plane was hijacked, I wish to be very clear: we are still investigating all possibilities as to what caused MH370 to deviate from its original flight path,\" he added.\n\nNajib said his announcement was based on new information from satellite contact with the plane and military radar data.\n\nThe combined data suggested \"with a high degree of certainty\" that the plane's two automated communications systems -- Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) and its transponder -- were \"switched off\" one after the other before it reached the point over the South China Sea where it dropped out of civilian radar contact.\n\nIt then turned back and flew in a westerly direction back over peninsular Malaysia before turning northwest.\n\nThe last confirmed communication between the plane and satellite was at 8:11 am, Najib said, adding that investigators were calculating how far the aircraft may have flown afterwards.\n\nSo far, experts had located the last point of communication as being inside one of two large geographical corridors: a northern corridor stretching from the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to northern Thailand, and a southern corridor stretching from Indonesia to the southern Indian ocean.\n\n\"This new satellite information has a significant impact on the nature and scope of the search operation,\" the prime minister said.\n\n\"We are ending our operations in the South China Sea and reassessing the redeployment of our assets. We are working with the relevant countries to request all information relevant to the search, including radar data,\" he added.\n\nIndian Navy finds nothing... yet\n\n\n\nIndian Navy ships supported by surveillance planes and helicopters are scouring Andaman Sea islands for a third day without any success in finding evidence of a missing Malaysia Airlines jet.\n\nVSR Murthy, a top Indian coast guard official, says the search has been expanded farther west into the Bay of Bengal on Saturday. Nearly a dozen ships, patrol vessels, surveillance aircraft and helicopters have been deployed but Murthy says, \"We have got nothing so far.\"\n\nSeeing no headway, Malaysian authorities suggested Friday a new search area of 9,000 square kilometers (3,474 square miles) to India along the Chennai coast in the Bay of Bengal, India's Defence Ministry said in a statement.\n\nAnalysis of electronic pulses picked up from a missing Malaysian airliner shows it could have run out of fuel and crashed into the Indian Ocean after it flew hundreds of miles off course, a source familiar with official US assessments said on Friday.\n\nThe source, who is familiar with data the US government is receiving from the investigation into the disappearance of the Malaysia Airlines plane, said the other, less likely possibility was that it flew on towards India.\n\n\n\nThe data obtained from pulses the plane sent to satellites had been interpreted to provide two different analyses because it was ambiguous, said the source, who declined to be identified because the investigation was continuing.\n\n\n\nBut it offers the first real clues as to the fate of Flight MH370, which officials increasingly believe was deliberately diverted off its scheduled course from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The Boeing 777-200ER was carrying 239 people.\n\n\n\nTwo sources familiar with the probe earlier said Malaysian military radar data showed a plane that investigators suspect was Flight MH370 following a commonly used navigational route toward the Middle East and Europe when it was last spotted by radar early on March 8, northwest of Malaysia.\n\n\n\nThe electronic pulses were believed to have been transmitted for several hours after the plane flew out of radar range, said the source familiar with the data.\n\n\n\nThe most likely possibility is that after travelling northwest, the airliner did a sharp turn to the south, into the Indian Ocean where officials think, based on the available data, it flew until it ran out of fuel and crashed into the sea, added the source.\n\n\n\nThe other interpretation from the pulses is that Flight MH370 continued to fly to the northwest and headed over Indian territory, said the source.\n\n\n\nPilot turned plane\n\n\n\nSpeaking to AFP on condition of anonymity, the official cited Malaysian military radar data that investigators believe indicate the Boeing 777 may have radically changed course and headed northwest towards the Indian Ocean.\n\n\n\n\"It has to be a skilled, competent and a current pilot,\" the official said.\n\n\n\n\"He knew how to avoid the civilian radar. He appears to have studied how to avoid it.\"\n\n\n\nThe intended flight path for the Kuala Lumpur-Beijing flight was to be north over the South China Sea and Vietnam.\n\n\n\nThe new information, coupled with multiple corroborative but unconfirmed reports, suggests the investigation into the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 was increasingly focusing on something going wrong in the cockpit.\n\n\n\nAnalysts have said that could include a sudden loss of cabin pressure or other mechanical event that incapacitated the pilots, catastrophic pilot error, or more sinister possibilities such as the plane being commandeered by a hijacker or rogue member of the flight crew, or pilot suicide.\n\n\n\nAll signs so far point to a \"controlled, deliberate act, not a mechanical failure\", said Scott Hamilton, managing director of US-based aviation consultancy Leeham Co.\n\n\n\nThe mounting reports of an unexplained banking to the west have coincided with a shift of search and rescue resources toward the Indian Ocean.\n\n\n\nFor complete coverage click below\n\nMissing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370: 12 key clues to world's most baffling aviation mystery","185":"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (NEWS1130) \u2013 Checks into the background of the Chinese citizens on board the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner have uncovered no links to terrorism, the Chinese ambassador in Kuala Lumpur said Tuesday.\n\nThe remarks will dampen speculation that Uighur Muslim separatists in far western Xinjiang province might have been involved with the disappearance of the Boeing 777 and its 239 passengers and crew early on March 8.\n\nMeantime, 25 countries are now involved in the search, which covers 2.24 million square nautical miles.\n\nThe plane was carrying 154 Chinese passengers, when Malaysian officials say someone on board deliberately diverted it from its route to Beijing less than one hour into the flight.

Files containing records of the simulations carried out on the program were deleted on Feb. 3, Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu told the news conference.\n\n\n\nFirst insurance payments made for missing plane: German insurance company Allianz said it has made initial payments in connection with the missing Malaysian Airlines plane, according to The Associated Press. Allianz's global head of communication Hugo Kidston confirmed Wednesday that the Munich-based insurer and \"other co-reinsurers of Malaysia Airlines aviation hull and liability policy have made initial payments.\"\n\nJet said to be most likely in southern Indian Ocean: Investigators probing the disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines jetliner with 239 people on board believe it most likely flew into the southern Indian Ocean, a source close to the investigation told Reuters.\n\n\"The working assumption is that it went south, and furthermore that it went to the southern end of that corridor,\" said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nMissing jet's U-turn programmed before signoff: The missing Malaysia Airlines jet's abrupt U-turn was programmed into the on-board computer well before the co-pilot calmly signed off with air traffic controllers, sources told NBC News.The change in direction was made at least 12 minutes before co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid said \"All right, good night,\" to controllers on the ground, the sources said.\n\nThe revelation further indicates that the aircraft's mysterious turnaround was planned and executed in the cockpit before controllers lost contact with Flight 370, but it doesn't necessarily indicate an ulterior motive.\n\nTuesday, March 18\n\nChina finds no terror link to its nationals: The Associated Press reported that checks into the background of the Chinese citizens on board the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner have uncovered no links to terrorism, the Chinese ambassador in Kuala Lumpur said Tuesday.\n\nThe remarks will dampen speculation that Uighur Muslim separatists in far-western Xinjiang province might have been involved with the disappearance of the Boeing 777 and its 239 passengers and crew early on March 8.\n\n\n\nThai radar may have spotted missing plane: A spokesman for Thailand's air force said it may have detected Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 with radar minutes after the missing jetliner's communications went down, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe radar tracked a plane that was flying toward to the Strait of Malacca, which is where Malaysian radar also tracked Flight 370 early March 8. The spokesman said the air force didn't share the information earlier because it wasn't specifically asked for it.\n\nChange in flight path entered via cockpit computer: New information suggests the change in the flight's direction was plugged into a computer in the cockpit by someone familiar with airplane computer systems. The fact that the turn was programmed into the computer in the cockpit raised more questions about the possible involvement of one of the flight crew.\n\nMonday, March 17\n\nNew phase of search underway: Search and rescue missions in the northern and southern corridors begin. Australia and Indonesia lead search in their own regions. A total of 26 countries are involved in the search.\n\nSunday, March 16\n\nSearch party expanded: The number of countries involved in the ongoing search for flight MH370 has expanded to 25 from 14, the Malaysian Transport Minister said at a press conference on Sunday, noting the search has entered a new phase and become more difficult.\n\nAdditional countries involved in the search effort include Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh.\n\n\n\nCorridors remain in focus: The search area remains focused on the northern and southern corridors identified earlier this weekend. Officials are currently discussing with all partners how best to deploy assets along the two corridors, both of which are being treated with equal importance.\n\nFurther investigating crew and passengers: All crew members and passengers on board flight MH370, as well as engineers who may have had contact with the aircraft prior to take off are being investigated, the Malaysian police chief said. He noted that hijacking, sabotage, personal and psychological problems remain the four areas of focus on this front.\n\nAccording to the authorities, police searched the homes of both the pilot and co-pilot on Saturday, March 15. Experts are examining the flight simulator found in the pilot's house, they said.\n\nAuthorities also confirmed that the pilot and co-pilot did not request to fly together.\n\nSaturday, March 15\n\n\"Deliberate\" action taken on board: Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak reveals at a press conference that actions taken on board Flight MH370 were deliberate \u2013 including the disabling of the aircraft's communications system shortly before the plane reached the east coast of Malaysia as well as the flight's divergence from its planned route.\n\nTurn back confirmed: Razak confirms that the plane turned back from its planned flight path over the over the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea, flying in a westerly direction back over the Malaysian Peninsula before turning northwest.\n\nLast signal: The last confirmed signal between the plane and a satellite came at 8:11 a.m. Malaysian time \u2014 about 7 1\/2 hours after takeoff.\n\nNew focus for search: Analysis of the plane's last communication with satellites places the aircraft in one of two \"corridors\" \u2013 a northern one from northern Thailand through to the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, and a southern one from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean, Razak said. Search efforts in the South China Sea are scheduled to end.","194":"It is clear that Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 was hijacked by an experienced pilot who knew how to operate a Boeing 777. This report in the New York Times supports what was already an overwhelming conclusion:\n\nThe first turn to the west that diverted the missing Malaysia Airlines plane from its planned flight path from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing was carried out through a computer system that was most likely programmed by someone in the plane\u2019s cockpit who was knowledgeable about airplane systems, according to senior American officials. Instead of manually operating the plane\u2019s controls, whoever altered Flight 370\u2019s path typed seven or eight keystrokes into a computer on a knee-high pedestal between the captain and the first officer, according to officials. The Flight Management System, as the computer is known, directs the plane from point to point specified in the flight plan submitted before a flight. It is not clear whether the plane\u2019s path was reprogrammed before or after it took off.\n\nSuspicion has focused on pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah and first officer Fariq Ab Hamid for one obvious reason: they were the only people on board the airline who, as far as is publicly known, knew how to fly it. Certainly the airplane could have been taken over by one or more Islamic terrorists, but it would have to be someone far better trained than those who carried out the September 11 attacks\u2013someone at or close to the level of a commercial airline pilot. A list of the passengers on the flight has been made public, but little or no information about them is known. China has said that it conducted background checks on the Chinese nationals who were on board (around two-thirds of the passengers) and found no links to terrorist groups. That at least reduces the likelihood of Uighurs being responsible.\n\nThere is another possibility that I have not seen discussed: here in the U.S., it is common for airline employees to hitch rides on their airline\u2019s flights when seats are available. Could there have been another Malaysia Airlines pilot \u201cdeadheading\u201d to Beijing on Flight 370, perhaps one with links to extremist groups? I have seen no discussion of that possibility. Thus, while we cannot rule out the possibility that there was another skilled pilot on board the airplane, at present there is zero evidence to support that supposition.\n\nWhich brings us back to the pilot and co-pilot. As the only people on the airplane known to have the skill and experience demonstrated by the hijacker(s), they are the prime suspects. That said, nothing that has come out about Zaharie Ahmad Shah or Fariq Ab Hamid adds materially to the case against them. Shah had a flight simulator in his home? So what? His wife and children left home the day before Flight 370 took off? OK, but did they flee the country or go to visit grandparents? He was a supporter of a prominent Malaysian politician who opposed the current government? That cuts in the other direction; Shah supported a \u201cnormal\u201d political party, not a terrorist group. As former El-Al security chief Isaac Yeffet said, Shah does not fit the profile of a terrorist.\n\nNeither does first officer Hamid. He was 27 years old and engaged to be married. No one has described any connections with radical Islamic or other potentially terrorist groups. As with Shah, no one has brought forth any evidence to suggest that Hamid may have been suicidal. Attention has focused on Hamid because he allegedly spoke the last words from the airplane\u2013\u201call right, good night\u201d\u2013at around the time the transponders were turned off. If it really was Hamid, and if the communication came after at least one of the transponders was switched off, it would suggest that Hamid was most likely the hijacker. But there has been confusion about the exact timing of the message, and it is not clear why officials at Malaysian Airlines say they think the voice was Hamid\u2019s. Even if one assumes they could distinguish Hamid\u2019s voice from Shah\u2019s, it is not clear how they could confidently distinguish Hamid\u2019s voice from that of an unknown hijacker.\n\nThere was no known connection between Shah and Hamid, and apparently they were randomly assigned to Flight 370. It is therefore extremely unlikely that both were involved in the hijacking. If one of the pilots was the culprit, it appears that he would have had to disable, in some way, the other pilot.\n\nThe case against the pilots, in short, is weak. But they will remain the prime suspects\u2013really, the only suspects\u2013unless and until it comes to light that there was someone else on board capable of flying the aircraft at a professional or near-professional level.\n\nMeanwhile, the central mystery of Flight 370 remains: where is the airplane? Until we know where the airplane was flown, we can only speculate about why it was hijacked. Until we know why it was hijacked, we can only speculate about who did it. Finding the airplane may or may not solve the puzzle of what happened to it, and why; but until the airplane is found, any theory we can put forward will be speculative at best.\n\nUPDATE: A pilot offers a seemingly plausible theory: there was an emergency on board, probably a fire; the pilot turned the airplane around to head for a nearby airport at Pulau Langkawi; the pilots were overcome before they arrived at that destination; and the airplane flew on, presumably in more or less a straight line, until it ran out of fuel somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean.","195":"As conspiracy theories abound about the disappearance of flight MH370, many Indian passengers, who had booked tickets for Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Langkawi or elsewhere in Asia Pacific, seem to be having second thoughts about boarding a Airlines plane. agents have been busy fielding requests from passengers who want to change their bookings to any other airline for their\u201cNearly 10-15 per cent of travellers have cancelled their bookings on the airline for the summer vacations,\u201d said Subhash Goyal, president of Indian Association of Tour Operators and Chairman of Stic Group.\n\nROUGH WEATHER\n\nAccording to experts, with at least 25 countries now joining the hunt for the missing aircraft, Malaysian Airlines has come under global scrutiny, which has dented the brand image of the company.are opting for Thai Airways, Singapore Airlines, Sri Lankan Airlines and Air India for their bookings.\u201cAll airlines follow international standards but some tourists just get sceptical after such incidents. It leaves a negative sentiment,\u201d said Goyal.While Airlines did not respond to an email query on the impact of the crisis on tourism, Dato Mirza Mohammad Taiyab, director general of Tourism Malaysia, said the mysterious disappearance of Airlines Boeing 777 had led to deferrals in visits by Chinese tourists. There was no impact on arrivals from other countries, he said. \u201cThe security at Kuala Lumpur international airport is of international standards. It handles 40 million passengers annually. Passengers have very little to fear,\u201d he added.While had seen a drop of nearly 20-25 per cent in the sale of Airline tickets just after the incident, bookings have started picking up in the last two days or so, with the airline now going back to its promotional discount offers of February, an industry executive said.Last year, 650,000 Indian tourists had visited and the target for this year is 800,000. Total number of Indians travelling abroad is pegged at 15 million as of 2013. As for Airlines, 10 per cent of its revenue is estimated to come from India, according to industry data. India is the third largest market for the airlines outside its home country, after Europe and Australia. This week, Tourism is holding promotional road shows in India. But, due to the ongoing crisis in the country, the tourism minister of has cancelled his visit for the event.\u201cThere is bound to be some impact on the airline and the tourism too. The airlines itself will have to come up with some special offers to recover the lost ground,\u201d said a senior executive of a portal, who did not wish to be named. Airlines connects to six Indian cities \u2014 Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Kochi. It operates 66 weekly non-stop flights between India and Kuala Lumpur, connecting to key Asia Pacific destinations.

The officials said it was unlikely that a passenger would have known enough about Boeing aircraft to have reprogrammed the system.\n\nThe officials weren't sure if the system was programmed before or after the flight departed Kuala Lumpur, though the changes were made sometime before the Acars communications system was shut off.\n\nWhile the plane's fate remains unknown, one theory\u2014suicide by pilot\u2014can likely be ruled out. From the New York Times:\n\nOne American safety expert, John Cox, a former airline union safety official, said that someone taking such pains to divert the plane does not fit the pattern of past cases when pilots intentionally crashed and killed everyone on board. \"There's an inconsistency in what we've seen historically,\" he said, comparing the disappearance of Flight 370 with two murder-suicides, on an Egyptair flight off Nantucket Island in 1999 and a SilkAir jet in Indonesia in 1997. In those crashes, he said, the pilot involved simply pushed the nose of the plane down and flew into the water.\n\n[Image via Getty]","197":"The search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 now covers 2.24 million square nautical miles.
