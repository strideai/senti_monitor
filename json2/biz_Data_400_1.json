{"Article":{"0":"This Is What the Taliban Said About the Missing Malaysia 777 When Asked if They Helped Hijack It Image Credit: AP\n\nWhile the search regarding the mysterious disappearance of the Malaysia Airlines plane deepens, it seems pretty safe to rule out one scenario: a Taliban hijacking.\n\nThe latest theories have suggested that the Boeing 777 plane may have flown north of the Bay of Bengal and towards the Pakistan-Afghanistan border where it is being held hostage. While the investigation has focused on the plane's passengers and crew, a terrorist plot has not been completely ruled out. But over the weekend, Taliban officials made it clear that they were not involved.\n\n\"It happened outside Afghanistan and you can see that even countries with very advanced equipment and facilities cannot figure out where it went,\" said Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman. \"So we also do not have any information as it is an external issue.\"\n\nIf that wasn't clear enough, a commander in Pakistani Taliban \u2014 the Taliban offshoot behind the attack on Malala Yousafzai \u2014 told Reuters that it would have been a dream to be behind such an operation.\n\nAlas, they were not. \"We wish we had an opportunity to hijack such a plane,\" he said.\n\nEven with the latest satellite data, authorities have struggled to effectively narrow down the plane's potential location or even area. There are two potential regions: one stretching from South Asia to Central Asia and one from Indonesia to the vast Indian Ocean by Australia.\n\nImage Credit: The New York Times\n\nAuthorities in India and Pakistan have not reported seeing the plane in their airspace, and it's unlikely that they would have missed it, given how heavy surveillance is on the border between the two rivals. Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan have similarly denied seeing an unidentified plane enter their respective countries.\n\nAs more evidence comes to light, investigators have increasingly considered foul play as the cause of the plane's disappearance. According to reports, the plane's controls were manually overridden and the computer flight path was reprogrammed before the plane went missing. Authorities have also honed in on the pilot's political background, although others on-board are also being investigated.","1":"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, March 18 (UPI) -- Search operations for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 have narrowed two search corridors to the north and to the south, Malaysian officials said Tuesday.\n\nActing Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said Indonesia and Australia were leading efforts in the southern corridor while China and Kazakhstan headed up the northern corridor, the (Malaysia) Star reported.\n\nHishammuddin, also Malaysia's defense minister, said nine countries that weren't along the corridors were assisting in the search that covers 2.24 million square nautical miles.\n\nThe hunt for the missing jetliner entered its 11th day Tuesday. Malaysia revealed that the last words heard from the cockpit came from the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid, but could not say whether he signed off before or after an automated communications system was disabled.\n\nThe Boeing 777-200 went off the radar March 8 about an hour after departing for Beijing from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, with 227 passengers and 12 crew members. So far the search has turned up nothing.\n\nDuring the weekend, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said his government believed the plane was diverted because its transponder and other communications devices were turned off manually several minutes apart, the New York Times reported.\n\nChinese media outlets said China's ambassador to Malaysia, Huang Huikang, said the Chinese government had ruled out suspicions of terrorism concerning the Chinese on board, who made up about two-thirds of the passengers.","2":"KUALA LUMPUR - Investigations into the mystery of a missing Malaysian jet appeared to be at a deadlock on Wednesday, with no conclusive evidence of foul play and doubts whether nations would share military tracking data that could show where the plane may have headed.\n\nEleven days have passed since Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 went missing, and 26 nations are struggling to search for the airliner over an area more than two-thirds the size of the continental United States.\n\nMalaysian and U.S. officials believe the aircraft was deliberately diverted but an exhaustive background search of the 239 passengers and crew aboard has not yielded any possible motive or link to terrorism.\n\nMalaysia's top official in charge of the unprecedented operation said it was vital to reduce the scale of the search and renewed appeals for sensitive military data from its neighbours that Malaysia believes may shed light on where the airliner flew.\n\n\"All the efforts must be used to actually narrow the corridors that we have announced - I think that is the best approach to do it. Otherwise we are in the realm of speculation again,\" Malaysia's Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters late on Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. Navy said it had switched mainly to using P-8A Poseidon and P-3 Orion aircraft to search for the missing plane instead of ships and helicopters.\n\n\"The maritime patrol aircraft are much more suited for this type of operation since the search field is growing,\" said Navy Lieutenant David Levy, who is on board the USS Blue Ridge, the U.S. Navy ship that is coordinating the search effort.\n\n\"It's just a much more efficient way to search,\" he said.\n\nFlight MH370 vanished from civilian air traffic control screens off Malaysia's east coast at 1:21 a.m. local time on March 8 (1721 GMT March 7), less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing.\n\nInvestigators piecing together patchy data from military radar and satellites believe that someone turned off vital datalinks and turned west, re-crossing the Malay Peninsula and following a commercial route towards India.\n\nAfter that, ephemeral pings picked up by one commercial satellite suggest the aircraft flew on for at least six hours, but investigators have very little idea whether it turned north or south, triggering a search expanding across two hemispheres.\n\nIn the latest of a series of possible sightings of the plane, police in the Indian Ocean island chain of the Maldives said they were investigating reports that people on one of its outer islands had seen a low-flying airplane there early on March 8. The police gave no further details.\n\nMalaysia Airlines Chief Executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said the fact that aircraft continued to exchange electronic \"handshakes\" with the satellite weighed against theories that the pilots were battling some kind of technical problem.\n\n\"There's a possibility of malfunction, but the satellite communication system was still active until the last time there was data at 8:11 a.m.,\" he said. \"There's some functionality in the system, except the reporting system was disabled.\"\n\nU.S. government sources said intelligence agencies had extensively analysed people on the flight but came up with no connections to terrorism or possible criminal motives.\n\nA senior U.S. official said he was \"not aware of any stones left unturned\".\n\nChina has said there is no evidence that Chinese passengers, who made up over two-thirds of those on board, were involved in a hijack or terror attack.\n\nUnless there is some kind of breakthrough, either in the form of new data or a sighting of the plane, the investigation appears to be drifting towards deadlock, sources said.\n\nHUGE SEARCH AREA\n\nAsked how important military tracking data would be to resolving the mystery, Hishammuddin said, \"It is very important. But in the case of Malaysia, we have actually put aside national security, national interest to get to where we are today.\"\n\nA senior diplomat in the region said military and government leaders were studying Malaysia's request, but there was no word so far on whether any data would be exchanged.\n\nMalaysia says it will have to buy a new radar system after revealing what it knew of the path the airliner took after turning back across its territory.\n\n\"It looks like the ball is in (others') court now and they need to decide what sort of military and other data they are willing to share with us,\" a Malaysian government source said.\n\n\n\nClouds hover outside the window of a Vietnam Air Force search and rescue aircraft An-26 on a mission to find the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, off Vietnam's Tho Chu island March 10, 2014. (Reuters)\n\nAnalysts say it will be difficult to persuade others to do the same, especially if the result would be to reveal weakness in their own defences given the numerous maritime and territorial boundary disputes going on in the region.\n\n\"Information and intelligence exchange is very sensitive in this part of the world where there is a lot of distrust and sovereign issues,\" said Ian Storey, a senior fellow at Singapore's Institute of Southeast Asian Studies.\n\n\"Countries are unwilling to share sensitive intelligence because if reveals their military capabilities - or lack of capabilities.\"\n\nThe search covers a total area of 2.24 million nautical miles (7.68 million sq km), from central Asia to the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nBecause of its size, scale of human loss and sheer uncertainty over what happened, the missing airliner looks set to establish itself as one of the most baffling air transport incidents of all time.\n\nA breakthrough is still possible, experts say. Wreckage could be found, but the more time elapsed since the aircraft's disappearance the more it will be scattered.\n\n\"It's a mystery and it may remain a mystery,\" says Elizabeth Quintalla, chief air power researcher at the Royal United Services Institute in London.","3":"The request page could not be found!\n\nBack to nst.com.my","4":"Thailand's military said Tuesday that its radar detected a plane that may have been Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 just minutes after the jetliner's communications went down, and that it didn't share the information with Malaysia earlier because it wasn't specifically asked for it.\n\nA twisting flight path described Tuesday by Thai air force spokesman Air Vice Marshal Montol Suchookorn took the plane to the Strait of Malacca, which is where Malaysian radar tracked Flight 370 early March 8. But Montol said the Thai military doesn't know whether it detected the same plane.\n\nThailand's failure to quickly share possible information regarding the fate of the plane, and the 239 people aboard it, may not substantially change what Malaysian officials know, but it raises questions about the degree to which some countries are sharing their defense information, even in the name of an urgent and mind-bending aviation mystery.\n\nWith only its own radar to go on, it took Malaysia a week to confirm that Flight 370 had entered the strait, an important detail that led it to change its search strategy.\n\nWhen asked why it took so long to release the information, Montol said, \"Because we did not pay any attention to it. The Royal Thai Air Force only looks after any threats against our country, so anything that did not look like a threat to us, we simply look at it without taking actions.\"\n\nHe said the plane never entered Thai airspace and that Malaysia's initial request for information in the early days of the search was not specific.\n\n\"When they asked again and there was new information and assumptions from (Malaysian) Prime Minister Najib Razak, we took a look at our information again,\" Montol said. \"It didn't take long for us to figure out, although it did take some experts to find out about it.\"\n\nFlight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur at 12:40 a.m. Malaysian time and its transponder, which allows air traffic controllers to identify and track the airplane, ceased communicating at 1:20 a.m.\n\nMontol said that at 1:28 a.m., Thai military radar \"was able to detect a signal, which was not a normal signal, of a plane flying in the direction opposite from the MH370 plane,\" back toward Kuala Lumpur. The plane later turned right, toward Butterworth, a Malaysian city along the Strait of Malacca. The radar signal was infrequent and did not include any data such as the flight number.\n\nHe said he didn't know exactly when Thai radar last detected the plane. Malaysian officials have said Flight 370 was last detected by their own military radar at 2:14 a.m.\n\nThe search area for the plane initially focused on the South China Sea, where ships and planes spent a week searching. Pings that a satellite detected from the plane hours after its communications went down have led authorities to concentrate instead on two vast arcs \u2014 one into central Asia and the other into the Indian Ocean \u2014 that together cover an expanse as big as Australia.\n\nThai officials said radar equipment in southern Thailand detected the plane. Malaysian officials have said the plane might ultimately have passed through northern Thailand, but Thai Air Chief Marshal Prajin Juntong told reporters Tuesday that the country's northern radar did not detect it.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nMalaysian Opposition Leader Rules Out 'Suicide' by Lost Jet's Pilot\n\nMissing Jet: Thailand Gives Radar Data After 10 Days\n\nLatest Information on Search for Malaysian Plane - Day 10\n\nPassengers, Crew on Board Missing Malaysia Plane","5":"Malaysian women write a message on the Wall of Hope for the missing Malaysian Airlines plane [EPA]\n\nWhat we want is the truth\n\nTen days after the airliner vanished an hour into its flight, hundreds of family members are still waiting for information in a Beijing hotel.\n\nAround two thirds of the 239 passengers on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 are Chinese.\n\nFamilies vented their pain and anger on Chinese representatives sent by the airline to meet them on Tuesday and demanded to see the Malaysian ambassador.\n\nOne said: \"What we want is the truth.

Good night.\" -- came after the signaling system was switched off, something experts say the pilots would almost certainly have been made aware of.\n\n\n\nTwenty-six countries have been asked to look for the missing plane in two vast areas, to the north from Thailand to Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, and to the south deep into the Indian Ocean toward Australia.\n\n\n\nBased on reporting by AP, Reuters, and RFE\/RL's Kyrgyz and Kazakh services","15":"An international land and sea search for a missing Malaysian jetliner is covering an area the size of Australia, authorities said today, but police and intelligence agencies have yet to establish a clear motive to explain its disappearance.\n\nInvestigators are convinced that someone with deep knowledge of the Boeing 777-200ER and commercial navigation diverted Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, carrying 12 crew and 227 mainly Chinese passengers, perhaps thousands of miles off its scheduled course from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.\n\nBut intensive background checks of everyone aboard have so far failed to find anyone with a known political or criminal motive to hijack or deliberately crash the plane, Western security sources and Chinese authorities said.\n\nMalaysian acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference the \u201cunique, unprecedented\u201c search covered a total area of 2.24 million nautical miles (7.68 million sq km), from central Asia to the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nFlight MH370 vanished from civilian air traffic control screens off Malaysia\u2018s east coast less than an hour after take-off early on March 8th.\n\nInvestigators piecing together patchy data from military radar and satellites believe that someone turned off the aircraft\u2018s identifying transponder and ACARS system, which transmits maintenance data, and turned west, re-crossing the Malay Peninsula and following a commercial aviation route towards India.\n\nMalaysian officials have backtracked on the exact sequence of events - they are now unsure whether the ACARS system was shut down before or after the last radio message was heard from the cockpit - but said that did not make a material difference.\n\n\u201cThis does not change our belief, as stated, that up until the point at which it left military primary radar coverage, the aircraft\u2018s movements were consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane,\u201c said Mr Hishammuddin. \u201cThat remains the position of the investigating team.\u201c\n\nBackground checks clean\n\nChina\u2018s ambassador to Malaysia said his country had carried out a detailed probe into its nationals aboard the flight and could rule out their involvement.\n\nUS and European security sources said efforts by various governments to investigate the backgrounds of everyone on the flight had not, as of Monday, turned up links to militant groups or anything else that could explain the jet\u2018s disappearance.\n\nA European diplomat in Kuala Lumpur also said trawls through the passenger manifest had come up blank.\n\nOne source familiar with US inquiries said the pilots were being studied because of the technical knowledge needed to disable the aircraft\u2018s communications systems.\n\nThe New York Times cited senior US officials as saying that the first turn back to the west was likely programmed into the aircraft\u2018s flight computer, rather than being executed manually, by someone knowledgeable about aircraft systems.\n\nMalaysia Airlines Chief Executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya told Tuesday\u2018s daily news conference that that was \u201cspeculation\u201c, adding: \u201cOnce you are in the aircraft, anything is possible.\u201c\n\nMalaysian officials said on Monday that suicide by the pilot or co-pilot was a line of inquiry, although they stressed that it was only one of the possibilities under investigation.\n\nMalaysian police have searched the homes of the captain, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, and first officer, Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, both in middle-class suburbs of Kuala Lumpur close to the airport.\n\nAmong the items taken for examination was a flight simulator Mr Zaharie had built in his home.\n\nA senior police officer with direct knowledge of the investigation said the programs from the pilot\u2018s simulator included Indian Ocean runways in the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Diego Garcia and southern India, although he added that US and European runways also featured.\n\n\u201cGenerally these flight simulators show hundreds or even thousands of runways,\u201c the officer said.\n\n\u201cWhat we are trying to see is what were the runways that were frequently used. We also need to see what routes the pilot had been assigned to before. This will take time, so people cannot jump the gun just yet.\u201c\n\nNeedle in a haystack\n\nThailand said today a re-examination of its military radar data had picked up the plane re-tracing its route across Peninsular Malaysia. The Thai military had previously said it had not detected any sign of the plane.\n\nWhat happened next is less certain. The plane may have flown for another six hours or more after dropping off Malaysian military radar about 200 miles northwest of Penang Island.\n\nBut the satellite signals that provide the only clues were not intended to work as locators. The best they can do is place the plane in one of two broad arcs - one stretching from Laos up to the Caspian, the other from west of Indonesia down to the Indian Ocean off Australia - when the last signal was picked up.\n\nMalaysia has asked countries along both corridors, as well as others with satellite capabilities, to re-examine their data to try to narrow the search area, Hishammuddin said.\n\nChina, which, with Kazakhstan, is leading the search in the northern corridor, said today it had deployed 21 satellites to scour its territory.\n\n\u201cIn accordance with Malaysia\u2018s request, we are mobilising satellites and radar to search over the Chinese section of the northern corridor, which the Malaysians say the plane may have flown over,\u201c said foreign mnistry spokesman Hong Lei.\n\nAustralia, which is leading the southernmost leg of the search, said it had shrunk its search field based on satellite tracking data and analysis of weather and currents, but that it still covered 600,000 sq km (230,000 sq miles).\n\n\u201cA needle in a haystack remains a good analogy,\u201c John Young, general manager of the emergency response division of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), told reporters.\n\n\u201cThe aircraft could have gone north or south, and if it went south, this is AMSA\u2018s best estimate of where we should look with the few resources we have at our disposal for such a search.\u201c\n\nThe US Navy was sending a P-8A Poseidon, its most advanced maritime surveillance aircraft, to Perth, in Western Australia, to assist with the search.\n\nThe disappearance of the plane was a major topic of conversation at the International Society of Transport Air Trading in San Diego, an annual gathering of 1,600 airplane makers, buyers and lessors.\n\n\u201cThe people that I deal with are looking at this with great concern - it appears considerable efforts may have gone into cloaking the aircraft,\u201c said Robert Agnew, chief executive of aviation consultants Morten Beyer & Agnew.\n\nReuters","16":"Hi\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nAlready a print edition subscriber, but don't have a login?","17":"404 Not Found\n\nThe server can not find the requested page:\n\nwww.osundefender.org\/%5C?p=154652 (port 80)\n\nPlease forward this error screen to www.osundefender.org's WebMaster.\n\nApache\/2.2.29 (Unix) mod_ssl\/2.2.29 OpenSSL\/1.0.1e-fips mod_bwlimited\/1.4 Server at www.osundefender.org Port 80","18":"The requested page \"\/npr\/search-flight-mh370-reportedly-largest-history\" could not be found.","19":"Page Not Found\n\nYou have requested a page that cannot be found.\n\nWe have recently migrated our site to a new platform which is why old links may no longer work.

Australian vessels scoured the southern Indian Ocean and China offered 21 of its satellites to help Malaysia in the unprecedented hunt.\n\nWith no wreckage found in one of the most puzzling aviation mysteries of all time, passengers' relatives have been left in an agonizing limbo.\n\nInvestigators say the Boeing 777 was deliberately diverted during its overnight flight and flew off-course for hours. They haven't ruled out hijacking, sabotage, or pilot suicide, and are checking the backgrounds of the 227 passengers and 12 crew members - as well as the ground crew - for personal problems, psychological issues or links to terrorists.\n\nMalaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said finding the plane was still the main focus, and he did not rule out that it might be discovered intact.\n\n\u201cThe fact that there was no distress signal, no ransom notes, no parties claiming responsibility, there is always hope,\u201d Hishammuddin said at a news conference.\n\nMalaysian Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said an initial investigation indicated that the last words ground controllers heard from the plane - \u201cAll right, good night\u201d - were spoken by the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid. A voice other than that of Fariq or the pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, it would have been clearest indication yet of something amiss in the cockpit before the flight went off-course.\n\nMalaysian officials said earlier that those words came after one of the jetliner's data communications systems - the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System - had been switched off, suggesting the voice from the cockpit may have been trying to deceive ground controllers.\n\nHowever, Ahmad said that while the last data transmission from ACARS - which gives plane performance and maintenance information - came before that, it was still unclear at what point the system was switched off, making any implications of the timing murkier.\n\nThe new information opened the possibility that both ACARS and the plane's transponders, which make the plane visible to civilian air traffic controllers, were turned off at about the same time. It also suggests that the message delivered from the cockpit could have preceded any of the severed communications.\n\nTurning off a transponder is easy and, in rare instances, there may be good reason to do so in flight - for example, if it were reporting incorrect data.\n\nThe Malaysian plane does not appear to fit that scenario, said John Gadzinski, a 737 captain.\n\n\u201cThere is a raised eyebrow, like Spock on Star Trek - you just sit there and go, 'Why would anybody do that?\u201d' Gadzinski said of what he is hearing among pilots.\n\nOther pilots in the United States cautioned against reading too much into what little is known so far about the actions of the Malaysia Airlines crew.\n\n\u201cYou can't take anything off the table until everything is on the table, and we don't even have an aircraft,\u201d said Boeing 737 pilot Mike Karn, president of the Coalition of Airline Pilots Associations.\n\nAuthorities have pointed to the shutdown of the transponders and the ACARS as evidence that someone with a detailed knowledge of the plane was involved. But Bob Coffman, an airline captain and former 777 pilot, said that kind of information is not hard to find in the digital age.\n\nAuthorities confiscated a flight simulator from the pilot's home Saturday and also visited the home of the co-pilot in what Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu Bakar initially said were the first police visits to those homes.\n\nBut the government, which has come under criticism abroad for missteps and foot-dragging in releasing information, issued a statement Monday contradicting that account, saying police first visited the pilots' homes as early as March 9, the day after the flight disappeared.\n\nCoffman said the flight simulator could signify nothing more than the pilot's zeal for his job.\n\n\u201cThere are people for whom flying is all consuming,\u201d he said, noting some pilots like to spend their off-duty hours on simulators at home, commenting on pilot blogs or playing fighter-pilot video games.\n\nAlthough Malaysian authorities requested that all nations with citizens aboard the flight conduct background checks on them, it wasn't clear how thoroughly the checks were done in Malaysia. The father of a Malaysian aviation engineer aboard the plane said police had not approached anyone in the family about his 29-year-old son, Mohamad Khairul Amri Selamat, though he added that there was no reason to suspect him.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible for him to be involved in something like this,\u201d said Selamat Omar, 60. \u201cWe are keeping our hopes high. I am praying hard that the plane didn't crash and that he will be back soon.\u201d\n\nFrench investigators arriving in Kuala Lumpur to lend expertise from the two-year search for an Air France jet that crashed in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009 said they were able to rely on distress signals. But that vital tool is missing in the Malaysia Airlines mystery because the flight's communications were deliberately silenced ahead of its disappearance, investigators say.\n\n\u201cIt's very different from the Air France case. The Malaysian situation is much more difficult,\u201d said Jean Paul Troadec, a special adviser to France's aviation accident investigation bureau.\n\nMalaysia's government sent diplomatic cables to all countries in the search area, seeking more planes and ships and asking for any radar data that might help.\n\nThe search involves 26 countries and initially focused on seas on either side of Peninsular Malaysia, in the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca.\n\nThe vast scope of the search was underlined when a U.S. destroyer that already has helped cover 15,000 square miles (38,850 square kilometres) of water dropped out.\n\nThe Navy concluded that long-range aircraft were more efficient in looking for the plane or its debris than the USS Kidd and its helicopters, so effective Tuesday the ship was leaving the Indian Ocean search area, said Navy Cmdr. William Marks, spokesman for the 7th Fleet. Navy P-3 and P-8 surveillance aircraft remain available, and can cover 15,000 square miles (38,850 square kilometres) in a nine-hour flight.\n\nOver the weekend, Prime Minister Najib Razak said investigators determined that a satellite picked up a faint signal from the aircraft about 7 1\/2 hours after takeoff. The signal indicated the plane would have been somewhere on a vast arc stretching from Kazakhstan in Central Asia to the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe southern Indian Ocean is the world's third-deepest and one of the most remote stretches of water, with little radar coverage.\n\nHishammuddin said Monday that searches in both the northern and southern stretches of the arc had begun, and that countries from Australia in the south, China in the north and Kazakhstan in the west had joined the hunt.\n\nHad the plane gone northwest to Central Asia, it would have crossed over countries with busy airspace. Some experts believe it more likely would have gone south, although Malaysian authorities are not ruling out the northern corridor and are eager for radar data that might confirm or rule out that route.\n\nThe northern corridor crosses through countries including China, India and Pakistan - all of which have said they have no sign of the plane. China, where two-thirds of the passengers were from, is providing several planes and 21 satellites for the search, Premier Li Keqiang said in a statement.\n\n\u201cFactors involved in the incident continue to multiply, the area of search-and-rescue continues to broaden, and the level of difficulty increases, but as long as there is one thread of hope, we will continue an all-out effort,\u201d Li said.\n\nIndonesia focused on Indian Ocean waters west of Sumatra, air force spokesman Rear Marshall Hadi Tjahjanto said.","21":": French experts will lend their expertise in underwater search operation to Malaysia which is leading a search and rescue (SAR) mission to locate the missing MH370 aircraft.Jean Paul Troadec, a special adviser to France's aviation accident investigation bureau, said their experience in investigating the Air France Flight 447 accident in 2009, might come in handy in the ongoing search for the Boeing 777-200ER aircraft.\"We specialise in the field of underwater search, experiment and technical aspect in communication and electronics,\" he told reporters when met at the Sama Sama Hotel here today.However, Troadec said the SAR operation for Flight MH370 would be different from that which located the Flight 447 aircraft immediately after the crash.\"The difference is that very soon after the accident of Air France Flight 447, we knew the limited area where the airplane was.\"We began the search very quickly after that accident (in 2009) which cannot be the case in the current situation. It will be different,\" he said.Troadec was among three officials from the French Civil Aviation Safety Investigation Authority (BEA) who arrived in Kuala Lumpur yesterday, to help with the SAR operation.Asked on the possible leading theory on the missing MH370, he said: \"We have no theory. We are just here to assist the Malaysian authorities. They conduct the investigation and we just share our experts and advice.\"The Beijing-bound Flight MH370, with 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board, disappeared about an hour after leaving the KL International Airport at 12.41am on March 8.It was scheduled to arrive in Beijing at 6.30am on the same day.A multinational search for the aircraft has so far, drawn a blank.","22":"Relatives of some of the Chinese passengers on the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 have threatened to go on hunger strike in an effort to force more information from the Malaysian authorities.\n\n\"Now we have no news, and everyone is understandably worried,\" said Wen Wanchen, whose son is among the 239 people on board.\n\n\"The relatives say they will go to the [Malaysian] embassy to find the ambassador. The Malaysian ambassador should be presenting himself here. But he's not. Relatives are very unsatisfied. So you hear them saying 'hunger strike',\" he told Agence France-Presse.\n\nChina said on Tuesday that it had deployed 21 satellites to search for the missing airliner. It was already searching those parts of its territory covered by a northern corridor that the aircraft could have flown through, state media said.\n\nAustralian and Indonesian authorities were leading the search along the plane's southern flight corridor. Australian officials scouring a 600,000sq km area of the Indian Ocean have described the effort as \"not just a needle in a haystack, it's a haystack that gets bigger and shifts\". China has adjusted its search along the norther corridor away from the South China Sea.\n\nThe Chinese ambassador in Kuala Lumpur said on Tuesday that authorities were conducting extensive checks on all Chinese passengers on board the missing jet but had found no evidence they were involved in any deliberate diversion of the plane.\n\nMore than 150 Chinese nationals were among the 239 people on Beijing-bound flight MH370 when it disappeared early on 8 March.\n\nInvestigators believe it was diverted deliberately and are investigating the background of the crew, ground staff and passengers. They have not ruled out hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to personal or psychological problems.\n\nChina \"conducted meticulous investigation into all the [Chinese] passengers, and did not find any evidence for sabotage activity\", Huang said at a press briefing that was reported by the South China Morning Post.\n\nMalaysia's opposition leader, Anwar Ibrahim, has confirmed that he is related to the captain of the MH370, Zaharie Ahmad Shah.\n\n\"I am not denying that he [Zaharie] is related to one of my in-laws and that I have met him on several occasions,\" Anwar told reporters on Tuesday. \"In fact, he is a close friend of [PKR supreme council member and Subang MP] R Sivarasa, as we said before.\"\n\nChina's Xinhau state news agency has reported that the country's premier, Li Keqiang, rang the Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, on Monday asking him to provide Beijing with more detailed data and information in a timely, accurate and comprehensive manner. He said that, despite the difficulty of the search, \"as long as there is still a gleam of hope we should continue to do our utmost\".\n\n\n\nMalaysia, US row amid search and confusion\n\nMalaysia's top official in charge of the search for a missing jetliner rejected criticism on Tuesday from US officials that it has not been sharing as much information as it could with foreign governments.\n\nA Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777-200ER vanished en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in the early hours of March 8 with 239 passengers and crew on board. No trace of the plane has been found.\n\nChina has called for better coordination in the search operation now involving 26 countries, while some U.S. officials and politicians have expressed frustration at what they see as Malaysia's refusal of help.\n\nMalaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein specifically defended coordination with the United States and China and said he had been in touch with his counterparts in both countries.\n\n\"This morning, I was (speaking) with (U.S. Defense Secretary) Chuck Hagel and then I was also with my counterpart (from) China,\" he told Reuters.\n\nHishammuddin denied reports that Malaysia had discouraged the Federal Bureau of Investigation from sending a team to Malaysia.\n\n\"I have been working with them. It's up to the FBI to tell us if they need more experts to help because it's not for us to know what they have.\" Malaysian officials say they have been in touch with the FBI through the U.S. embassy, where the agency has a permanent representative, from \"day one\".\n\n\"No matter what everyone says, the cooperation that I am getting for Malaysia and for what efforts I am doing, it is overwhelming,\" Hishammuddin said.\n\nTwo U.S. security officials said on Monday that Malaysia had still not invited the FBI to send a team.\n\nOne source in Kuala Lumpur familiar with the investigation said an FBI team was in Malaysia to help with the probe. But another source familiar with the matter confirmed that no one had arrived from the United States to reinforce the FBI presence in the country.\n\nAn unprecedented search for the missing flight now stretches across Asia, from the Caspian Sea to the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nInvestigators are convinced that someone with deep knowledge of the Boeing 777-200ER and commercial navigation diverted the jet, carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew, perhaps thousands of miles off course.\n\n\n\n'Someone with deep knowledge diverted it'\n\nKUALA LUMPUR: Intensive background checks of everyone aboard a missing Malaysian jetliner have so far failed to find anyone with a known political or criminal motive to crash or hijack the plane, Western security sources and Chinese authorities said.\n\nMalaysia said it had conferred with the U.S. and Chinese ministers on the search for Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370, an unprecedented 26-nation operation that now spans Asia from the Caspian Sea to the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nInvestigators are convinced that someone with deep knowledge of the Boeing 777-200ER and commercial navigation diverted the jet, carrying 12 crew and 227 mainly Chinese passengers, perhaps thousands of miles off course.\n\nChina's ambassador to Malaysia said the country had carried out a detailed probe into its nationals aboard the flight, which vanished on March 8, and could rule out their involvement.\n\n\"The probe into the incident's cause is not suitable to be conducted in a high-profile way,\" Ambassador Huang Huikang told Chinese reporters, state television said on one of its official microblogs on Tuesday.\n\nU.S. and European security sources said efforts by various governments to investigate the backgrounds of everyone on the flight had not, as of Monday, turned up links to militant groups or anything else that could explain the jet's disappearance.\n\nA European diplomat in Kuala Lumpur also said trawls through the passenger manifest had come up blank.\n\nSearch for missing plane expands to Kazakhstan\n\nKuala Lumpur: The search for the missing Malaysian jet pushed deep into the northern and southern hemispheres on Monday as Australia took the lead in scouring the seas of the southern Indian Ocean and Kazakhstan \u2014 about 10,000 miles to the northwest \u2014 answered Malaysia\u2019s call for help in the unprecedented hunt.\n\nFrench investigators arriving to lend expertise from the two-year search for an Air France jet that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009 said they were able to rely on distress signals \u2014 but investigators say the Malaysian airliner\u2019s communications links were deliberately severed ahead of its mysterious disappearance more than a week ago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very different from the Air France case. The Malaysian situation is much more difficult,\u201d Jean Paul Troadec, a special adviser to France\u2019s aviation accident investigation bureau, said in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe co-pilot of a missing Malaysian jetliner spoke the last words heard from the cockpit, the airline\u2019s chief executive said on Monday, as investigators consider suicide by the captain or first officer as one possible explanation for the disappearance.\n\nNo trace of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 has been found since it vanished on March 8 with 239 people aboard.\n\nInvestigators are increasingly convinced it was diverted perhaps thousands of miles off course by someone with deep knowledge of the Boeing 777-200ER and commercial navigation.\n\nA search unprecedented in its scale is now under way for the plane, covering an area stretching from the shores of the Caspian Sea in the north to deep in the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nAirline chief executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya also told a news conference that it was unclear exactly when one of the plane\u2019s automatic tracking systems had been disabled, appearing to contradict the weekend comments of government ministers.\n\nSuspicions of hijacking or sabotage had hardened further when officials said on Sunday that the last radio message from the plane \u2014 an informal \u201call right, good night\u201d \u2014 was spoken after the system, known as \u201cACARS\u201d, was shut down.\n\n\u201cInitial investigations indicate it was the co-pilot who basically spoke the last time it was recorded on tape,\u201d Ahmad Jauhari said on Monday, when asked who it was believed had spoken those words.\n\nThat was a sign-off to air traffic controllers at 1.19 am, as the Beijing-bound plane left Malaysian airspace.\n\nThe last transmission from the ACARS system \u2014 a maintenance computer that relays data on the plane\u2019s status \u2014 had been received at 1.07 am, as the plane crossed Malaysia\u2019s northeast coast and headed out over the Gulf of Thailand.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know when the ACARS was switched off after that,\u201d Ahmad Jauhari said. \u201cIt was supposed to transmit 30 minutes from there, but that transmission did not come through.\u201d\n\nMalaysia\u2019s government in the meantime sent out diplomatic cables to all countries in the search area, seeking their help with the search, as well as to ask for any radar data that might help narrow the task. Some 26 countries are involved in the search, which initially focused on seas on either side of peninsular Malaysia, in the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca.\n\nOver the weekend, however, Malaysian Prime Minister Najeeb Razak announced that investigators determined that a satellite picked up a faint signal from the aircraft about seven hours after takeoff. The signal indicated that the plane would have been somewhere on a vast arc stretching from Kazakhstan down to the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.\n\nHad the plane gone northwest to Central Asia, it would have crossed over countries with busy airspace, and some experts believe the person in control of the aircraft would more likely have chosen to go south. However, authorities are not ruling out the northern corridor and are eager for radar data that might confirm or rule out that path.\n\nThe northern search corridor crosses through countries including China, India and Pakistan \u2014 all of which have indicated they have seen no sign of the plane so far.\n\nRelatives of Chinese passengers aboard the missing plane voiced fury on Monday, accusing the Malaysian government of \u201ctalking nonsense\u201d and launching a cover-up while a rescue could have been carried out.\n\n\u201cOnly the Malaysia government knows the truth. They\u2019ve been talking nonsense since the beginning,\u201d said Wen Wancheng, following a meeting with airline officials in Beijing as the search entered its 10th day.\n\n\u201cYou hid the whereabouts from the beginning and after seven to eight days you discovered it? That was the best time to launch a rescue,\u201d added the 63-year-old from the eastern province of Shandong, whose son was aboard the missing jet.\n\nAnother relative who left the meeting told AFP: \u201cOf course there is no useful information for us, there never is.\u201d\n\nThe relatives\u2019 anger came as Malaysia drew more scathing criticism from Chinese state media and social media users.\n\nMalaysian prime minister on Saturday disclosed that the flight had been deliberately diverted, and that the plane flew for several hours after leaving its intended flight path.","23":"After ten days of frustration, swinging between hope and despair, some relatives of the Chinese passengers aboard Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 have threatened a hunger strike.\n\nMany of the Chinese relatives are convinced that the Malaysian authorities are withholding vital information from them. Roughly two-thirds of the passengers who boarded the plane, a total of 153, were Chinese.\n\nAfter days of attacking Malaysian officials with water bottles and shouting abuse at the Malaysian ambassador, some have reached breaking point.\n\n\u201cProgress is too slow, the authorities are hiding information,\u201d said Mr Chen, the 63-year-old father of Chen Changjun, one of the passengers.\n\n\u201cSeveral relatives want to have a hunger strike to protest,\u201d he said.\n\nOutside the conference room where the relatives have been waiting, a woman clutched a placard before the Chinese media on Tuesday. \u201cRespect life. Give us back our families,\u201d it said.\n\nThe woman, who declined to give her name, said the idea of a hunger strike, which had first been mooted on Sunday, was now gathering momentum.\n\n\u201cSince they haven\u2019t given us the truth about those people\u2019s lives, all of us are protesting. All the relatives are facing mental breakdowns,\u201d she told the AFP newswire.\n\nHowever Mr Chen said that a large number of relatives believe the idea is too extreme. \u201cSuch a radical action will not change anything,\u201d he said.\n\nAhmad Jauhari Yahya, the chief executive of Malaysia Airlines, said the company was concerned for the well-being of the relatives. \u201cWe are doing all we can to ensure that the family members have sufficient assistance and information. This is something we will look into and if anything like this happens, we will obviously take immediate action,\u201d he said.\n\nMalaysia Airlines has dispatched a counsellor for each of the relatives to help them through the trauma. But China has severely criticised the Malaysian response to the missing plane. In a series of scathing editorials in the state media, the Chinese have accused the Malaysians of incompetence.\n\nAdditional reporting by Adam Wu","24":"Never miss a great news story!\n\nGet instant notifications from Economic Times\n\nAllowNot now\n\nYou can switch off notifications anytime using browser settings.","25":"Months after the launch of legalized retail marijuana in Colorado, the state is still trying to better regulate the drug and close the loopholes.\n\nGov.

Everybody came together on this.\"\n\nChildren's Hospital, based in Aurora, has weighed in on the legislative efforts -- reporting an increase in emergency room visits and patient admissions from accidental exposure.\n\nDr. Sam Wang, pediatric emergency physician, said symptoms range from basic sleepiness to more severe cases, where children have not been able to breathe properly and required breathing tubes. \"As recreational marijuana goes forward, it's obviously going to increase availability and potentially increase unintentional exposures as well,\" Wang said.\n\nOther fixes signed by the governor on Monday include giving authority to pot shops to confiscate forms of identification, if they have reason to believe someone underaged is using a fake ID. Another measure calls for local jurisdictions to submit fingerprints to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for the purpose of conducting fingerprint-based criminal record checks on people working in marijuana businesses.\n\nState Sen. Linda Newell, a Democratic co-sponsor, acknowledged their work is not done. \"We will probably find these clean-up bills as we go through the years after marijuana, both medical marijuana as well as recreational marijuana, has become a norm in Colorado,\" she said.\n\nThe issue of stoned drivers is another trouble spot for state lawmakers. At a laboratory certified to test blood samples for marijuana, the director told Fox News there is not a roadside test, such as a breathalyzer, in the foreseeable future for determining if a driver is under the influence of cannabis.\n\n\"One person may have a very high THC concentration in their blood, particularly medical marijuana users, and they're not affected. Where someone who has never smoked marijuana before, will have a much lower concentration and be very affected,\" said Dr. Robert Lantz, of Rocky Mountain Instrumental Laboratories.\n\nAccording to state Marijuana Enforcement Division Public Information Officer Julie Postlethwait, Colorado has issued licenses to hundreds of vendors, including:\n\n-- 183 retail stores\n\n-- 238 retail cultivation facilities\n\n-- 44 product manufacturers (i.e., edibles)\n\n-- 4 testing facilities (for product potency and contaminants)\n\nDozens more are pending with the state in these categories. For those with state licenses in hand, they may not be open yet because they have to obtain paperwork at the local level, too.\n\nLocal permission can be thorny because Amendment 64, the state constitutional amendment which legalized recreational pot, left it up to municipalities in the Centennial State to decide whether to allow marijuana businesses within their borders.\n\nDale Dyke and Chastity Osborn, a husband-and-wife team who converted their home into a bed and breakfast, complained that the \"laws are very gray.\" Their business Get High Getaways was catering to marijuana tourists until the City of Lakewood ordered them to shut down the overnight stays. One complication is that while Colorado legalized recreational pot, the state left it illegal to use the drug outside in public or in traditional hotel rooms. For now, the couple is maintaining their location as a car service while working with investors to purchase a new location.\n\nRecently, a marijuana job fair in Denver drew thousands of people with lines stretching a few blocks long. It has been referred to in local media reports as a \"green rush.\"\n\nVisitors told Fox News they're moving to the state in hopes of finding jobs in the marijuana business. Shane Wylie and Matthew Bean are among them. They drove 1,300 miles from Louisiana, just in time for the fair.\n\n\"This is our life-changing experience, this is our big step and career change,\" Wylie explained. Bean added, \"I want to start from the bottom, so I can learn everything.\"\n\nFox News' Lloyd Gottschalk contributed to this report.\n\nAlicia Acuna joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in 1997 and currently serves as a general assignment reporter based in the network's Denver bureau.","26":"In line near midday on a Friday are a guy with a backpack, a suit on a cell phone, three chatty coeds and a middle-aged couple with a camera.\n\nIt\u2019s business as usual at LoDo Wellness Center, one of the 54 licensed retail marijuana dispensaries in Denver. Some customers wait to order leafy buds named Sour Diesel, Dragon and Bubba Kush. Fewer just want to price or smell the merchandise.\n\nFriendly clerks\u2014nicknamed \u201cbud tenders\u201d here and elsewhere\u2014advise, weigh, fetch and roll. Shopping happens early because closing time, citywide, is 7 p.m. for these stores.\n\nCannabis sales for recreational purposes turned legal Jan. 1 in Colorado, but each community decides how and whether business proceeds. Colorado Springs, one hour south of Denver, bans recreational sales. Vail is on the fence, with a moratorium until at least July 31, but a marijuana superstore proposal slowly begins clearing hurdles in Eagle, population 6,400 and 30 miles west.\n\nColorado\u2019s experience with full legalization is of interest to other states\u2014including Wisconsin\u2014that are considering easing restrictions on the sale of recreational or medical marijuana.\n\nColorado\u2019s approach to business is far from uniform and not every issue has been addressed. For example, potency of commercially manufactured \u201cedibles\u201d\u2014foods and beverages infused with THC\u2014doesn\u2019t match product labels, according to lab analyses commissioned by The Denver Post.\n\nEntrepreneurs smell opportunity and confront roadblocks, particularly in opening members-only social clubs for pot smoking.\n\nDispensaries have multiple personalities. The reception area at LoDo Wellness looks like a homey living room, good for lounging, with a window view of pot plants growing under greenhouse lights. In contrast, the narrowness of Good Chemistry, near Colorado\u2019s State Capitol, provides little room or opportunity for gawking. Healing House, near the University of Denver, displays merchandise like fine jewelry, stretched beneath glass countertops. The 3D Cannabis Center, a warehouse not far from Denver Coliseum, was closed on a weekday afternoon, without explanation.\n\nTourism offices, for now, take a hands-off approach to pot tourism. That means no comprehensive guides (or vetting process) for pot-friendly lodging, tours or nightlife.\n\nOne thing is certain: Colorado collected about $2 million in taxes from $14 million in recreational pot sales during January, and optimists say it\u2019s the birth of a billion-dollar industry.\n\n\u201cIn progressive precincts, pot is becoming a fixture of polite society,\u201d asserts party planner Jane West of Denver\u2019s Edible Events during a recent interview with TV journalist Harry Smith. \u201cWe\u2019re changing the face of what a cannabis consumer looks like.\u201d\n\nHere are a few things mile-high travelers will want to know.\n\nHow will I know where pot is being sold?\n\nConsult weedmaps.com, which shows sales outlets throughout the U.S. Only Colorado allows shops for recreational use. That changes this spring, when rec shops open in the state of Washington.\n\nHow can I compare prices and get the word on quality?\n\nCheck ads and product reviews in alternative weekly newspapers: Westword (westword.com) in Denver, the Boulder Weekly (boulderweekly.com) and Colorado Springs Independent (csindy.com). The Denver Post\u2019s marijuana editor manages thecannabist.com.\n\nCan you buy it in Colorado caf\u00e9s, as is done in Amsterdam?\n\nNo. Only licensed dispensaries sell cannabis products legally, but you can\u2019t light up or snack on edibles there. Similarly, you can\u2019t buy a pot-infused dessert at a restaurant, but sometimes events invite attendees to BYOC (Bring Your Own Cannabis). Edible Events organizes high-end functions.\n\nMust I be a Colorado resident?\n\nNo, but how much you can purchase for recreational purposes is dictated by residency. A Colorado resident can buy one ounce. A non-resident\u2019s limit is one-fourth of an ounce.\n\nSales typically are for one-eighth ounce. Prices are all over the place, depending upon the strain, and can be twice as expensive for rec users vs. medical patients. Ads for a $15 eighth are likely not for tourists.\n\nWe saw joints priced at $8 to $15, and online averages of $40 or $45 for an eighth.\n\nDo I need a prescription to buy?\n\nNo, but you must be at least 21 and flash a government-issued photo I.D. to get into rec dispensaries.\n\nForget about seeing a medically licensed dispensary unless you can slide a state-issued \u201cred card\u201d\u2014medical marijuana card\u2014through a security window.\n\nWhen a dispensary is licensed both ways, you\u2019ll only shop in the rec area. Medical patients may possess two ounces of pot\u2014or more, depending on what their docs recommend\u2014and purchases aren\u2019t taxed as high. Being a medical marijuana patient also is the only way for those under 21 to legally buy pot products. Approved conditions for medical marijuana use include cancer, glaucoma, HIV or a chronic\/debilitating condition with severe pain, nausea, spasms or seizures.\n\nMust I use cash?\n\nIt depends upon the dispensary. Ask before shopping. Some have an ATM.\n\nWhere can I smoke?\n\nNot in public view. Not while driving. Not on ski slopes. Not in most hotel rooms; state law says at least 75% per property must be smoke-free. Some hotels are entirely smoke-free, so check before making assumptions.\n\nSome music venues, like Quixote\u2019s True Blue in Denver, have a concealed outdoor patio for smoking. Good for Deadheads.\n\nI don\u2019t smoke, so what kind of pot-infused alternatives can I enjoy?\n\nPackaged brownies, chocolate-dipped pretzels, hard candy, gummies, spiked punches\u2014you name it. The range of products depends upon the dispensary, and it pays to compare prices, but few tip their hand online.\n\nProduct potency might be lots higher than you\u2019d expect, especially if you haven\u2019t indulged for decades.\n\nEdibles with 100 mg of THC seem typical, and bud tenders advise starting with one-fourth of whatever you buy, then waiting at least 30 minutes before deciding whether to nibble more.\n\nA single Love\u2019s Oven oatmeal cookie with 100 mg of THC cost $25 (plus tax) at The Healing House, and the same potency in Dr. J\u2019s Flying Aces hard candy cost $18. Good Chemistry\u2019s thumb-wide chocolate-caramel cups from Mountain Medicine sell for $10.\n\nHow will I know if what I\u2019m buying is any good?\n\nTalk frankly to a \u201cbud tender\u201d\u2014dispensary sales staffer\u2014about how you define \u201cgood.\u201d Much depends upon expectations, and bud tenders should be knowledgeable about their strains of products and effects.\n\nIf you don\u2019t feel comfortable with the answers, find another dispensary. There\u2019s no obligation to buy.\n\nAre there any consumer protections? Or regulations?\n\nThis isn\u2019t dark-alley dealing\u2014a sales license is required. Although it\u2019s OK to share small amounts of stash if no money is exchanged, personal sales of marijuana remain illegal.\n\nWhatever is bought from a dispensary is labeled with great detail. Each product can be traced back to a specific grower and plant.\n\nTo complain, contact the confidential tip line of Colorado\u2019s Marijuana Enforcement Division at 855-277-7500 or file online with the state\u2019s Consumer Protection Section (coloradoattorneygeneral.gov).\n\nHow are police dealing with stoned drivers? Is it a problem?\n\nIt is illegal to drive under the influence. You can get a DUI with a minimum of five nanograms (five billionths of a gram) of THC per milliliter of blood. That\u2019s \u201cjust a few hits off a joint,\u201d concludes weedmaps.com.\n\nA $1 million television ad campaign, to remind people not drive stoned, began this month after Colorado State Patrol reported 31 of 61 impaired motorists in January were detained because of marijuana.\n\n\u201cDrive high, get a DUI\u201d is the slogan, and ads use humor to make their point.\n\nCan I drive to Colorado, load up my car with pot, and leave?\n\nWe have no evidence of border patrols, but transporting cannabis or products containing it across state lines is illegal. As a federal offense, maximum punishment is one year in jail and a $1,000 fine.\n\nDepending on your route home, penalties could be more severe: Get nabbed in Nebraska with more than one pound, for example, and max consequences are five years and $10,000.

John Hickenlooper (D) shakes hands with state Sen. Linda Newell, a sponsor of the measure he signed to strengthen Colorado's marijuana packaging requirements, at the Capitol in Denver on Monday.\n\nA new Colorado law, signed by Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) Monday, closes a loophole in the state's marijuana laws, extending the same packaging requirements to medical marijuana products that already exist for recreational ones.\n\nUnder the new law, edible marijuana products sold to medical marijuana patients must be in opaque, child-proof packaging. The law also allows marijuana businesses to confiscate fake IDs from minors, just as liquor stores do, and requires that marijuana grown in a home with minors must be enclosed and locked.\n\nAdvocates of the law, which included the marijuana industry, say it is an important clarification that will help keep legal marijuana from getting into the hands of minors. \"Keeping marijuana out of the hands of kids should be a priority for all of us,\" said Governor Hickenlooper, before signing the bill.\n\nRecommended: How much do you know about marijuana? Take the quiz\n\nBut there is still disagreement about whether the regulations go far enough. In particular, the popular niche of marijuana \"edibles\" \u2013 candy, cookies, gummy bears, lollipops \u2013 has been controversial, since skeptics say it can be too easy for someone to confuse the products with their non-pot-infused counterparts, or to ingest higher quantities of THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana, than they intend. There have also been concerns about the accuracy of testing and labeling, particularly when it comes to the potency of such products.\n\nThe new packaging requirements \"are a step in the right direction,\" says Rachel O'Bryan, an attorney and member of Smart Colorado, a group pushing for tighter regulation. \"But the underlying product in the packaging can still be confused with real food. The second you take it out of that packaging, you don't know if the product is a gummy bear or a\" marijuana-infused product.\n\nMs. O'Bryan cites the incident in a Westminster, Colo., middle school last week in which a student brought marijuana candies to school and shared them with friends, some of whom said they didn't know the candy contained marijuana. In another incident, reported in Steamboat Springs last week, an 18-year-old man cleaning a condo apparently ate a candy bar left behind by the renters without realizing it was infused with marijuana. He went to the hospital and was treated for an overdose.\n\nIn the middle school incident, at least 15 students were involved, according to police and three have been arrested. Several more are facing suspensions. But O'Bryan says that she would prefer to see punishment of the adults \u2013 who presumably purchased the candy and made it accessible \u2013 than the students.\n\n\"We would like to see both messaging to Colorado parents, as well as strict enforcement of laws that when an adult gives marijuana to a child they are going to be held accountable,\" she says.\n\nHer group would also like to see tighter regulations on the amount of marijuana concentrates that can be sold. Buying an ounce of pure THC, as is currently allowed, says O'Bryan, can be the equivalent of roughly 2,800 servings and yet could fit into a shampoo bottle. \"That's concerning to us when the No. 1 [federal] priority is keeping it out of hands of minors.\"\n\nSuch concerns have some validity, says Michael Elliott, executive director of the Medical Marijuana Industry Group, but in most cases he doesn't think new laws are necessary. The packaging law was an appropriate way to close a loophole, Mr. Elliott says, but the Department of Revenue can look into limits on concentrates and can set rules.\n\n\"We have a very good process in place, and the Department of Revenue is doing a tremendous job in a very difficult environment,\" says Elliott.\n\nConcerns have been raised, too, about the accuracy of testing and the ability of labs to handle the state's needs. Starting May 1, all edibles that are sold from a recreational pot business must have been tested for potency. And by Oct. 1, all marijuana products will need to be tested both for potency and contaminants.\n\nThe Denver Post has raised questions about the accuracy of some of the testing. And Elliott says there are concerns about whether there will be enough labs to meet the demand. Currently there are three licensed facilities, and three more on the way.\n\n\"It\u2019s a huge testing burden,\" says Elliott.\n\nSince recreational sales became legal in Colorado on Jan. 1, the state has been under tremendous scrutiny. But while there have been some anecdotal incidents of increased emergency room visits and minors accessing pot, there isn't much data.\n\nElliott says that the lack of incidents should be viewed as a success.\n\n\"All the public safety nightmares people said were going to happen, none of them materialized,\" Elliott says, noting that both traffic fatalities and teen marijuana use both went down in the past few years. Unlike the black-market system through which marijuana is readily available in the rest of the world, he adds, \"we now have a system of accountability and transparency.\"\n\nThe biggest safety concern that Elliott and marijuana industry members still have, he says, is that marijuana businesses, no matter how big, can't use banks. They are forced to deal almost exclusively in cash \u2013 a situation that could make them attractive targets for criminals.\n\nCritics of legalization say it's far too soon to count Colorado as a success.\n\nProject SAM (Smart Approaches to Marijuana), a national group that opposes legalization, has started a new website, legalizationviolations.org, that tracks some kinds of incidents in Colorado and Washington State, which has also legalized recreational marijuana. Recent posts speak of Colorado pot crossing into Nebraska and Wyoming and teenagers using vaporizers \u2013 a sort of e-cigarette \u2013 to discreetly smoke pot in class, since there's no smell or smoke.\n\n\"Any steps to reduce access to kids and make it less likely kids will use marijuana is laudable, but I think will ultimately be unsuccessful in the framework of legalization,\" says Kevin Sabet, the cofounder of Project SAM and director of the Drug Policy Institute at the University of Florida. \"Because legalization by definition is the commercialization of marijuana and companies only make money off heavy users, they have to target young people as part of a successful business model.\"","28":"DENVER (CBS4) \u2013 Two former top regulators of Colorado\u2019s marijuana industry have now gone to work for the other side.\n\nColorado\u2019s Amendment 64 bars legislators from lobbying state officials for two years after they leave office. But there\u2019s nothing that stops former department directors from going to work for the industry they regulated.\n\nMatt Cook and Laura Harris\u2019 jobs were to enforce the rules and regulations of Colorado\u2019s marijuana industry. Now both of them are working for it.\n\nThe news about Harris comes in a release from Denver Relief Consulting that states \u201cformer cannabis enforcement chief joins firm.\u201d\n\nThe release does not state exactly what Harris, the former head of marijuana enforcement, will do but cites her background in regulatory compliance.\n\nElena Nunez is State Executive Director of Common Cause, a non-partisan organization that works for credible government.\n\n\u201cThere are a couple of problems potentially. One, they have specialized knowledge of the agency and its processes and they also have special relationships that can influence their ability to get approval for contracts contributions or other things,\u201d said Nunez.\n\nMatt Cook was spotlighted on the CBS news program \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cMatt Cook, a former narcotics officer, wrote the law and served as the state\u2019s first director of enforcement,\u201d they said.\n\nCook is now a consultant to the marijuana industry with the 60 Minutes interview displayed on his website. His credentials include Senior Director of Enforcement for the Colorado Department of Revenue.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure those folks who are privy to confidential information about the industry or client matters. Maintain that confidentiality and privilege,\u201d said State Rep. and Assistant House Majority Leader Dan Pabon.\n\nHarris and Cook could not be reached for comment. The governor\u2019s office said it found no legal or ethical breach on their part.","29":"Municipal voters this spring will decide on a variety of issues, including marijuana, shooting at drones and whether to allow all-terrain vehicles on city streets, according to the Colorado Municipal League.\n\nMost of the spring elections will take place on either April 1 or 8, with Green Mountain Fall and Lone Tree\u2019s elections happening in May.\n\nSome communities will decide whether to allow marijuana sales, while others will consider marijuana taxes.\n\nHere is a list of spring\u2019s ballot measures CML is aware of:\n\n\n\n\n\nBALLOT MEASURES\n\n\u2022 TABOR excess revenue retention: Crawford and Mead\n\n\u2022 Debt: Erie, $6.2 million for a police station and municipal court building; Keenesburg, $960,000 for street improvements; Lyons, $995,000 to match a FEMA community disaster loan; Pagosa Springs, $18 million for a community recreation center; Ridgway, $1.9 million for street improvements; and Wellington, $2.4 million for a town park.\n\n\u2022 Easing legal publication requirements: Buena Vista, Gilcrest, Ignacio, Manzanola, Palisade and Parachute.\n\n\u2022 Term limits: Basalt, clarify how term limits are applied; Morrison and Starkville, remove; Parachute, extend\n\n\u2022 Sales tax: Bayfield, 1% for street improvements; Deer Trail, increase the tax by $18,000 for town operations; Estes Park, 1% for municipal services; Keenesburg, 1% for town operations; La Veta, 0.5% for museum and street improvements; Montrose, 0.3 % for its recreation district; Pagosa Springs, 1% for the community recreation center debt question.\n\n\u2022 Property tax: Bow Mar, 10 mills for various street improvements\n\n\u2022 Lodging tax: Kersey, impose one; Naturita, continue an existing one\n\n\u2022 Marijuana tax: Black Hawk, 5%; Dillon, 5%; Fruita, 5%; Larkspur, 5%; Mancos, occupation tax; Silverton, 1% sales and 3% excise tax\n\n\u2022 Marijuana, whether to allow: Collbran, De Beque, Fruita, Larkspur, Palmer Lake , and Red Cliff\n\n\u2022 Growth: Berthoud, annexation of a specific property and an initiative requiring certain future annexations to be granted only through an election\n\nMISCELLANEOUS\n\n\u2022 Deer Trail: approval to shoot at drones\n\n\u2022 Granada: sell its municipal electric utility to Southeast Colorado Power Association\n\n\u2022 Hartman: reduce the town board size from seven to five\n\n\u2022 Lochbuie: change its election date from April to November\n\n\u2022 Montrose: broadband distribution\n\n\u2022 Nederland and Pagosa Springs: compensation for the mayor and trustees\n\n\u2022 Silverton: allow ATVs on municipal streets","30":"DENVER \u2014 Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper \u2014 who opposed the referendum that legalized marijuana in his state \u2014 said Monday he hasn\u2019t seen the economic fallout he feared.\n\nHickenlooper, whose priority has been luring businesses and entrepreneurs to Denver, Boulder, and other hubs, had worried a view of Colorado\u2019s as the stoner state could \u201cdistort all the work that we\u2019ve done\u201d in presenting a pro-business image, he said in an interview.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen it yet,\u201d he said of the feared negative economic impact. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have been so aggressive and rigorous with implementing the regulations.\u201d\n\nThe referendum legalized the use of marijuana, as well as possession of up to an ounce, for all Colorado residents over 21. Titled \u201cAmendment 64,\u201d it went into effect on Dec. 10, 2012, after passing by a 9% margin of the popular vote the previous month, though legal sales of marijuana didn\u2019t begin until January of this year.\n\nHickenlooper, to the fury of the referendum\u2019s supporters, opposed it, but has worked with the nascent legal industry to impose a strict regulatory and tax regime \u2014 and he said the industry has been as cooperative as he always thought it would be.\n\n\u201cWe predicted that this would be an industry that would function like any other industry \u2014 that they would be no more or less driven or acquisitive than any other industry and they would be no more or less given to regulation and supporting regulation,\u201d Hickenlooper said between bites of breakfast burrito at a long desk in his Capitol office. \u201cThey look at their self-interest just like another business, but it\u2019s a whole different framework: No one has ever had a self-interest like this, where they have got to protect the right to do in a state what\u2019s illegal nationally.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe industry was a great supporter of our very stiff tax rates; generally they\u2019ve been supportive of our pretty stiff regulation,\u201d he said.\n\nColorado residents can purchase up to an ounce of marijuana only from specialty licensed retail shops. Currently, only already-existing medical marijuana dispensaries are eligible for a recreational license, though this restriction will lift in October of this year. Retailers must properly label all products with clear information regarding warnings, serving size, and potency, and any marijuana magazines must be treated like pornography by being placed behind the counter. Additionally, those who choose to grow their own plants at home are limited to six plants, with only three flowering at any given time.\n\nHickenlooper said his main remaining worry is polling suggesting that legalization has persuaded young people that marijuana is perfectly safe, when many neurologists believe it can impair a developing brain.\n\nHe also said the benefits of tax revenues from the legal product can be overstated.\n\n\u201cThe other governors tease me, they say, \u2018I wouldn\u2019t be so rigorous if I had $130 million in tax revenue projected,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s a drop in the bucket compared to how the world thinks of your state as a place to build a business.\u201d\n\nHickenlooper, indeed, is running for reelection on a platform of economic growth and pro-business management. His state weathered the economic crisis better than most, and his regular emails to supporters bely much concern that marijuana has derailed its growth.\n\n\u201cWhile the rest of the country\u2019s economy is slowly picking back up, we\u2019re thriving here in Colorado,\u201d he wrote earlier this month.\n\nWeed also appears unlikely to be a central election issue. Hickenlooper opponent Bob Beauprez recently told ABC News that he\u2019d look for \u201ca way to agree with\u201d Hickenlooper on marijuana regulation.\n\nHickenlooper said he was \u201csurprised\u201d that Beauprez, a former congressman, had chosen to enter the race. \u201cI would have thought he would have supported a lot of our economic development stuff,\u201d he said.\n\nColorado, though, is the fulcrum of nearly every other divisive issue in the country: Hickenlooper is under assault from the right for his support of gun control, and from the left for backing the natural gas extraction technique known as fracking. Republicans, in particular, see an opportunity in tying Hickenlooper to the Affordable Care Act, which he supports, although Colorado\u2019s state-run health insurance exchange has not been as troubled as HealthCare.gov.\n\n\u201cI am concerned that it is going to be a difficult year for Democrats and I am going to be painted with that same brush,\u201d he said. And while he pointed to a rare decrease in the rate of growth in health care costs as a sign that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s cost-control measures are working, he says he doesn\u2019t expect that to help much with the politics. He also said he doesn\u2019t anticipate wanting President Obama (or any other out-of-state figure) to campaign for him.\n\n\u201cAs a campaign thing, when I walk into a room and say how many people hate the ACA, half of the hands or two-thirds of the hands in the room go up,\u201d he said.\n\nHickenlooper also quietly came out for marriage equality toward the bottom of a press release March 3, a decision he described Monday as a \u201cnuance\u201d and natural evolution from his longtime support for equal civil marriage rights, while leaving churches free to make their own decisions.\n\n\u201cThe debate had changed sufficiently that I think people can understand that supporting civil marriage is a way of saying I support every single right for every single person,\u201d he said.","31":"Colorado legislative economists on Tuesday predicted that recreational marijuana taxes will bring in only half of what Gov. John Hickenlooper expects they will.\n\nA forecast produced by economists at the nonpartisan Colorado Legislative Council projects taxes on recreational marijuana will generate about $65 million in the fiscal year beginning in July. Hickenlooper\u2019s projection, released last month, expects nearly twice that \u2014 $125 million.\n\nThe new prediction further adds to the debate over how lucrative first-in-the-nation taxes on recreational marijuana will be for the state\u2019s coffers. In January, tax revenue came in on pace to be far below previous predictions for the last six months of the current fiscal year.\n\nBut Legislative Council economist Larson Silbaugh told members of the legislature\u2019s Joint Budget Committee on Tuesday that too many variables \u2014 from the low number of stores open, to the high interest in history-making marijuana purchases \u2014 make the January numbers unreliable predictors of what\u2019s to come.\n\n\u201cYou can basically use that January number to justify any forecast you want,\u201d he said.\n\nInstead, Silbaugh said Legislative Council economists are more pessimistic than the governor\u2019s economists about how many people will stay in the recreational marijuana market long-term. Recreational marijuana costs about 20 percent more than medical marijuana, he said.

Nor is the decision likely to clog the courts with thousands of demands for reversals, since the defendant\u2019s case was unusual in that it was on appeal when Amendment 64 was approved.\n\nBut the retroactive application of the amendment is disturbing \u2014 and it\u2019s good to see state Attorney General John Suthers saying he\u2019s going to appeal the ruling.\n\nAs the court itself noted, \u201cwhen construing a constitutional amendment, unless its terms clearly show intent that the amendment be retroactively applied, \u2018we presume the amendment has prospective application only.\u2019 \u201d Amendment 64 had no retroactive provision. But the court reasoned that state statute and doctrine established by the Supreme Court allow \u201ca defendant to benefit retroactively from a significant change in the law.\u201d And there\u2019s no doubt Amendment 64 changed law.\n\nSuthers counters that \u201cwell-established retroactivity law in Colorado indicates that statutory changes are prospective only unless the General Assembly or the voters have clearly indicated\u201d otherwise.\n\nAnd he worries about \u201cthe implications this ruling may have on other non-marijuana cases.\u201d\n\nIndeed, lawmakers could become reluctant to make major adjustments in the criminal code if they will have a cascading effect on those previously convicted.\n\nBy the way, the actual prosecution of the defendant, Brandi Jessica Russell, was hardly a miscarriage of justice. She tested for amphetamine, marijuana and methamphetamine after she and her husband took an injured baby to the hospital and the doctor grew suspicious. And the appeals court did uphold her conviction on possession of meth.","43":"With Colorado legalizing marijuana for recreational use, making it legal to grow up to six plants for an individual, other states are looking at getting on the weed wagon. Many already are, decriminalizing possession of smaller amounts of pot, as well as legalization for medical purposes.\n\nSales in Colorado have been stellar, and the state is reaping the benefits, big time. In the first month alone, licensed dispensaries hit a whopping $14 million dollars in sales, and the state received a cool $2 million of those proceeds.\n\nGov. John Hickenlooper (D) recently announced that he expects that the combined sales from both legal medical and recreational marijuana in the state will reach nearly $1 billion in the next fiscal year -- about $600 million of that is projected to come from just recreational sales. The state stands to collect at least $134 million in taxes and fees.\n\nAnd then there is big tobacco, with companies seeing a serious decline in sales in the U.S., are forced to turn their markets to other countries, and pushing their deadly fares in China, Russia and India, to name a few. Smokers in the US have dropped to less than half of the people who smoked in the 1950's. Smokers are becoming a thing of the past. It is a known fact that tobacco kills and as such, many states have banned smoking in any public buildings or structures.\n\nWith the popularity of tobacco declining, and the popularity of marijuana on the rise, following the medical marijuana legalization in 20 states and recreational legalization in Colorado and Washington, and at least 58 percent of Americans agreeing that it should be legalized, it appears pot already has replaced tobacco smoking in America, and the tobacco industry would be crazy not to get on board.\n\nWith all of this cash to be made from an alternative smoking product, why not? However, when the largest tobacco company in the U.S., Philip Morris, was asked the question about the future intentions of its company, spokesman Bill Phelps told CBS: \"We have a practice of not commenting or speculating on future business. Adding, tobacco companies are in the business of manufacturing and marketing tobacco products.\"\n\nBut one can rest assured, if governments continue to treat smoking as the public health menace it is, the tobacco industry may not have a future at all, at least in the U.S. And as marijuana popularity continues to grow, thereby inadvertently replacing tobacco products, it could save their imminent decline, so it makes perfect sense.\n\nBut there is another entity that could take the marijuana boom to a new level, and that is the liquor industry.\n\nThe Washington State Liquor Control Board is receiving plenty of applications from people who want to be certified to be able to grow pot legally, even though the agency is not yet soliciting such applications. The agency's spokesman Brian Smith said Tuesday that some applications so far have come from people who have long been growing marijuana when it was against state law.\n\n\"We're getting a lot of interest from people that want to be producers,\" Smith said. \"Some say they have been growing it illegally until now.\"\n\nWhere pot will go commercially is still unknown, but it is bound to happen soon.\n\nImage via YouTube","44":"Sorry the page you were looking is not here.\n\nTo search in site, type a keyword and hit enter","45":"Winter Weather Advisory issued February 11 at 8:42AM MST expiring February 12 at 3:00PM MST in effect for: Alamosa, Chaffee, Costilla, Custer, Fremont, Huerfano, Las Animas, Pueblo, Rio Grande, Saguache, Teller\n\nWinter Weather Advisory issued February 11 at 8:42AM MST expiring February 12 at 3:00PM MST in effect for: Chaffee, Lake, Saguache\n\nWinter Weather Advisory issued February 11 at 8:42AM MST expiring February 12 at 3:00PM MST in effect for: Chaffee, Lake\n\nWinter Weather Advisory issued February 11 at 8:42AM MST expiring February 12 at 3:00PM MST in effect for: Conejos, El Paso, Fremont, Mineral, Rio Grande, Saguache, Teller\n\nFire Weather Warning issued February 11 at 12:32PM MST expiring February 11 at 6:00PM MST in effect for: Baca, Huerfano, Las Animas\n\nWinter Weather Advisory issued February 11 at 10:58AM MST expiring February 12 at 5:00PM MST in effect for: Archuleta, Dolores, Gunnison, Hinsdale, La Plata, Montezuma, Montrose, Ouray, San Juan, San Miguel\n\nWinter Weather Advisory issued February 11 at 10:58AM MST expiring February 12 at 5:00AM MST in effect for: Delta, Eagle, Garfield, Gunnison, Mesa, Moffat, Montrose, Pitkin, Rio Blanco, Routt\n\nWinter Weather Advisory issued February 11 at 10:58AM MST expiring February 12 at 9:00AM MST in effect for: Delta, Mesa, Montrose, Ouray, San Miguel\n\nWinter Weather Advisory issued February 11 at 5:30AM MST expiring February 12 at 3:00PM MST in effect for: Chaffee\n\nWinter Weather Advisory issued February 11 at 5:30AM MST expiring February 12 at 3:00PM MST in effect for: Alamosa, Chaffee, Costilla, Custer, Fremont, Huerfano, Las Animas, Pueblo, Saguache\n\nWinter Weather Advisory issued February 11 at 5:30AM MST expiring February 12 at 3:00PM MST in effect for: El Paso, Fremont, Teller\n\nWinter Weather Advisory issued February 11 at 5:30AM MST expiring February 12 at 3:00PM MST in effect for: Conejos, Mineral, Rio Grande, Saguache\n\nWinter Weather Advisory issued February 11 at 5:30AM MST expiring February 12 at 3:00PM MST in effect for: Chaffee, Custer, Fremont, Huerfano, Rio Grande, Saguache, Teller\n\nWinter Weather Advisory issued February 10 at 2:42PM MST expiring February 12 at 5:00PM MST in effect for: Chaffee, Lake, Saguache\n\nWinter Weather Advisory issued February 10 at 2:42PM MST expiring February 12 at 5:00PM MST in effect for: Chaffee, Conejos, Mineral, Rio Grande, Saguache\n\nWinter Storm Watch issued February 10 at 10:08PM MST expiring February 12 at 4:00PM MST in effect for: Alamosa, Chaffee, Costilla, Custer, El Paso, Fremont, Huerfano, Las Animas, Pueblo, Saguache, Teller\n\nWinter Storm Watch issued February 10 at 2:42PM MST expiring February 12 at 4:00PM MST in effect for: Fremont\n\nWinter Storm Watch issued February 10 at 2:42PM MST expiring February 12 at 4:00PM MST in effect for: Alamosa, Chaffee, Costilla, Custer, El Paso, Fremont, Huerfano, Las Animas, Pueblo, Saguache, Teller\n\nFire Weather Watch issued February 9 at 2:59PM MST expiring February 11 at 6:00PM MST in effect for: Baca, Huerfano, Las Animas","46":"The consulting arm of Denver Relief, a cannabis grower and retailer in Colorado's capital, today announced that Laura Harris, former director of the state Department of Revenue's Marijuana Enforcement Division (MED), has joined the firm as a regulatory adviser. Harris, who took over what was then the Medical Marijuana Enforcement Division in late 2011, retired last August after 30 years of working for the revenue department. In an email message that was leaked to The Denver Post, Harris said she had planned to stay at the MED until mid-2014, after the newly legal recreational pot stores were up and running, \"but I found that the personal toll of this job was too much.\" She added that \"I found that I was becoming ineffective with my colleagues at those times when it was necessary to address areas of disagreement.\"\n\nWhen I interviewed Harris for my 2013 Reason cover story about legalization in Colorado, I found her to be refreshingly candid. Although Colorado's medical marijuana regulations were widely cited as a model for other states, she made it clear that they were largely arbitrary and difficult to enforce. She questioned the rule requiring dispensaries to grow at least 70 percent of their inventory (which applies to recreational stores until this October) and the practicality of developing child-resistant packaging for cannabis-infused foods. \"The current code is extremely difficult to regulate,\" she said. \"What you will hear from many in industry is that this works. Well I'm not as optimistic about it working. If it worked, we would be able to present evidence of how the model works toward good enforcement.\" This was two months before the state auditor released a report that was sharply critical of medical marijuana regulation in Colorado.\n\nHarris, who worked as a revenue agent and a criminal investigator before becoming Colorado's chief cannabis regulator, had a pretty steep learning curve. \"Even in college,,\" she said, \"I did not partake. I can say that honestly. I had friends in law enforcement. My first husband was in law enforcement, which was the environment in which I was raised. My perception of what marijuana was when I came into this division is the little flowers in the baggie that I had seen others carry around.\" A year or so later, she had learned \"much more about the canabis plant, much more about the theory around its medicinal effects and much more about what is actually extracted from the plants other than the flower\u2014the resin and all the products that are created from the resin. So yes, its been very educational.\"\n\nNow Harris will be educating others\u2014not about the plant so much as the often baffling rules surrounding its use. \"It's exciting to be able to bring my expertise on cannabis regulation to Denver Relief Consulting, a firm that has demonstrated a commitment to establishing a responsible model for the entire nation to follow,\" she says in a press release. \"As more states follow Colorado's regulatory lead, both in medical and retail cannabis, it is imperative that individual governments have a framework in which to work so that there are no unintended consequences.\" Harris' transition is yet another sign that marijuana is becoming an industry like any other, faster than many of us anticipated.\n\nRelated: \"DEA Agent Joins Marijuana Industry\"","47":"Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world.","48":"Server Error\n\n404 - File or directory not found.

Toyota also will be charged with wire fraud, with the prosecution deferred for three years as long as the company continues cooperation with authorities.\"Toyota intentionally concealed information and misled the public,\" Holder said today at a Justice Department news conference. \"Toyota confronted a public-safety emergency as if it were a simple public-relations problem.\"The settlement represents the largest criminal penalty imposed on an automaker in the U.S., he said.Christopher P. Reynolds, chief legal officer for Toyota Motor North America, said the company \"took full responsibility\" for its actions.\"In the more than four years since these recalls, we have gone back to basics at Toyota to put our customers first,\" he said in a statement. \"We have made fundamental changes across our global operations to become a more responsive company -- listening better to our customers' needs and proactively taking action to serve them.\"In this Nov. 5, 2010 file photo released by the Utah Highway Patrol, a Toyota Camry is... Read MoreToyota's American depositary receipts fell 1 percent to $108.68 at the close in New York. The ADRs have fallen 11 percent this year, while the NYSE Composite Index has slipped 0.4 percent.The recalls blemished Toyota's reputation for quality that spurred its rise to become the world's top-selling automaker, a title it relinquished for one year to General Motors ( GM ) A settlement would put Toyota a step closer to resolving legal fallout of those recalls as GM faces probes into how it handled defective ignition switches blamed for at least 12 deaths.U.S. regulators and officials, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation's New York office, according to a person familiar with the matter, are probing GM after the recall of 1.6 million Chevrolet Cobalts and other small-car models linked to the fatalities. On March 17, GM said it's recalling 1.55 million vans, sedans and sport utility vehicles , citing concerns over brakes, seat belts and air bags.Holder, while refusing to confirm nor deny any federal investigation into GM, said the Toyota case will be a model for the government's approach to such issues.\"Other car companies should not repeat Toyota's mistake: A recall may damage a company's reputation, but deceiving your customers makes that damage far more lasting,\" he said.U.S. Attorney for Southern District of New York Preet Bharara, %VIRTUAL-article-sponsoredlinks%who joined holder at the news conference, said the settlement effectively puts Toyota on probation for three years while the way it deals with safety issues is monitored.Bharara said it was particularly outrageous that \"at a maximum moment of crisis when people in America were really concerned were they driving safe cars or not,\" Toyota was saying \"loudly and forcefully, on television and in press releases and on their website, at every juncture, to reassure the public and protect its brand: 'Don't worry about it, we've got it covered, we have gotten to the root cause of the problem.' And that was false.\"Toyota recalled more than 10 million vehicles worldwide in 2009 and 2010 following complaints of sudden, unintended acceleration. The Toyota City, Japan-based company made modifications to gas pedals and floor mats that were prone to shifting around and jamming the accelerator. Toyota also installed brake override software on recalled models and began making the systems standard on new vehicles.Holder said that Toyota failed to promptly disclose and correct safety issues about which the company was aware. Toyota instead made misleading public statements and gave inaccurate information to members of Congress, he said. The company also concealed from regulators the extent of problems some customers had with sticking gas pedals and unsecured floor mats, he said.In addition to the criminal probe by the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's office and the New York office of the FBI, Toyota's recalls also led to lawsuits claiming defects harmed the value of Toyota vehicles or caused accidents leading to death and injury. Toyota settled lawsuits brought by car owners who claimed economic losses for about $1.6 billion.Toyota last year agreed to try to resolve the personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits that were brought in the wake of the recalls.In a March 17 status report filed in federal court in Santa Ana, Calif., Toyota and lawyers representing the plaintiffs said they had reached agreements in principle to settle 131 cases. The carmaker is trying to settle more than 300 cases, according to the filing.Terms of the settlements weren't disclosed.The economic-loss agreement and today's penalty bring the automaker's legal payouts to almost $3 billion. Toyota may earn $19 billion in the 2014 fiscal year, the average of analyst estimates.Toyota surrendered global auto sales leadership to Detroit-based GM in 2011 after Japan's tsunami and floods in Thailand disrupted production. The automaker has regained the global sales crown the past two years and is again ranked at or near the top of automotive quality ratings.\"The reality is the consumer has moved on from Toyota a long time ago,\" said Alan Baum, an analyst at Baum & Associates in West Bloomfield, Michigan. \"In the market this had a six to nine month impact.

Over the past four years, U.S. investigators have been examining how Toyota dealt with driver complaints about a sudden increase in acceleration in its vehicles and whether the company made incomplete disclosures.\n\n\u201cToyota has cooperated with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in this matter for more than four years,\u201d Steve Curtis, a spokesperson for Toyota, said according to Bloomberg. \u201cDuring that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Justice also found that Toyota had made misleading statements to the U.S. government and the public about safety problems in its vehicles, which came to light during the company's internal audit.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA, said in 2010 that five people had died as a result of accidents due to unwanted acceleration, according to the Wall Street Journal. Toyota has been fined four times by the NHTSA for a total of $66.2 million, for not reporting safety defects to the government, out of which three fines were related to unwanted acceleration.\n\nIn February, the company had recalled 2.1 million vehicles worldwide due to a software problem, which led to sudden stops in models such as the Prius, RAV4, Tacoma and Lexus.

The company has already paid out billions of dollars to settle civil claims related to the accidents.\n\nThe Justice Department investigation was initiated to determine what Toyota knew and when it knew it. The company\u2019s public statements and disclosures to regulators were found to be misleading at least, and the unprecedented size of the settlement should be a warning shot across the bow of General Motors Co.

Yellen is known as a proponent of transparency \u2013 but she\u2019s expected to say as little as possible about what those other factors might be. Here's why:\n\n1.

The FOMC is widely expected to reduce the central bank\u2019s massive asset purchases program, known as quantitative easing, for a third month in a row by another $10 billion, to $55 billion a month. In January, the Fed cut its monthly pace of bond buying from an original $85 billion in $10 billion increments to $65 billion. The pullback is expected to occur despite challenges the U.S. economy and financial markets face, from a brutal winter that`s depressed growth, to fears about how Russia`s aggression toward Ukraine might slow the global economy. Recent data indicated that the economic recovery in the U.S. remains sluggish. Data released in the previous session showed annual rate of inflation slowed to 1.1% in February from 1.6% in January. Yellen to put her stamp at her first news conference as Fed chair The'Janet Yellen'era at the Federal Reserve begins today, with a two-day meeting, a policy statement and fresh economic forecasts to be released at 18:00 GMT. Investors will be parsing every word for any hint of a policy shift. Global financial markets will closely watch Fed\u2019s post-decision speech, looking for answers on whether Yellen will embrace Ben Bernanke`s approach of keeping rates low while gradually paring stimulus or, might she prove even more dovish than Bernanke to favor low rates to try to accelerate job growth, even at the risk of high inflation? The dollar was buying \u00a5101.558 after opening at \u00a5101.417, up by 0.14 percent through the day. The USDJPY pair so far hit a session high at \u00a5101.685 and session low at \u00a5101.294. The yen lost more than 0.15 percent against the dollar, having reacted to data on Wednesday showing that Japan reported a larger-than-forecast trade deficit in February. Investors remained cautious over tensions in Ukraine, however, tension eased somewhat today after Russian President Vladimir Putin said he did not plan to seize other regions of Ukraine, a day after Crimean citizens voted to be annexed by Moscow. UK in focus, Osborn to stick to austerity course Pound strengthened further after the Bank of England officials showed consensus on keeping interest rate and stimulus unchanged, according in the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s March 5-6 meeting published today. Policymakers voted unanimously to keep interest rates at a record-low 0.5 percent and maintain the asset-purchase target at 375 billion pounds. Britain\u2019s unemployment rate held steady in the three months through January at 7.2 percent, in line with median forecasts, reinforcing BoE\u2019s case for keeping interest rates at a record low. Meanwhile, the number of job seekers retreated by 63 thousands to 2.33 million in the three months through January, while the number of workers edged up 105 thousands to 30.2 million. Later, attention will shift to the annual UK budget. UK`s Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne is expected, to stick to his tough austerity plan to fix the public finances.

How will she handle the spotlight?\n\nYellen breezed through her confirmation and recent Hill hearings, deftly batting back questions from Republicans concerned that the Fed is a rogue operator usurping congressional authority over economic policy. She is as deeply experienced in monetary policy and will have spent hours with staff preparing for Wednesday\u2019s gathering with reporters.\n\nBut sitting in the big chair with the entire world watching and wondering if she will go off script about the Fed\u2019s plans for asset purchases or rate hikes is a different matter. There is always something of a shakedown cruise as investors and the public adjust to a new Fed chair\u2019s style.\n\nAlan Greenspan spoke in looping, inscrutable paragraphs. Ben Bernanke favored a much simpler and more direct style. Each had some dicey moments when markets were not entirely sure what they meant. Virtually all the betting on Wall Street and in Washington is that Yellen will cruise through the news conference without a hitch.\n\n( PHOTOS: The Ben Bernanke years)\n\nBut it\u2019s no guarantee.\n\n\u201cIf she conducts herself in front of the press the way she did in front of Congress, I think it will be very well received,\u201d said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. \u201cShe bent over backwards to answer every question and to be as clear as possible, and I think investors are going to have a warm and fuzzy feeling about our new chair.\u201d\n\nAblin and several others said the one area where Yellen might have a bit of weakness is her relationships with executives on Wall Street. She comes from the academic and public policy world and lacks the kind of deep ties to bankers that can help in a major crisis.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting if someone asks her who she would call if we have another white-knuckle event like 2008,\u201d Ablin said.\n\n2. What will she say about the economy?\n\nThere is little chance the Fed, whose Federal Open Market Committee will announce its policy decision just before the news conference, will change course from its current plans to keep pulling back on its economic stimulus efforts at each meeting. The so-called taper, in which the central bank reduces the amount of bonds it buys each month, will almost certainly continue, probably by an additional $10 billion.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Full finance policy coverage)\n\nThe February employment report showing a gain of 175,000 jobs eased concerns about another spring economic swoon and freed Yellen to continue Bernanke\u2019s efforts to get the central bank out of the business of buying assets by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cTapering another $10 billion is a foregone conclusion,\u201d said PNC chief economist Stu Hoffman.\n\nBeyond that, there are big questions.\n\nWill Yellen move to jettison the Fed\u2019s current target of 6.5 percent unemployment as the number at which rate hikes could be considered? Joblessness is now at 6.7 percent, but many argue that neither the labor market nor the economy is especially healthy.\n\nWill Yellen cite other statistics she prefers as indicators of labor market health? Will she address those who believe the natural unemployment rate is now more than 6 percent and that the short-term jobless rate of just 4.2 percent indicates a fairly tight labor market with faster wage inflation just around the corner?\n\n\u201cThey could [point to] things like a significant improvement in the job market, which could be a combination of the unemployment rate going down, the quit rate going up, the job openings going up,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably more likely than lowering the unemployment rate to a new threshold.\u201d\n\nDemocrats worried about the 2014 midterm elections will want Yellen to focus on the long-term unemployment rate and make it clear the Fed will keep its benchmark interest rate near zero well into next year. Republicans will want Yellen to focus on snuffing out any signs of inflation.\n\nFollow @politico","88":"Investing.com -\n\nInvesting.com - Investors will be focusing on the outcome of the Federal Reserve's monthly policy meeting later Wednesday. Meanwhile, the U.K. is to release its latest jobs report, while the Bank of England is to publish its latest meeting minutes. Later Wednesday, New Zealand is to release data on fourth quarter growth.\n\nFederal Open Market Committee Meeting\n\nThis will be the first Federal Reserve board meeting with Janet Yellen at the helm. Investors expect the Fed to continue to taper its bond purchasing program by $10 billion to $55 billion, despite recent weak U.S. economic reports. The central bank is also expected to hold interest rates at record lows. The Fed meeting is to be followed by a press conference with Janet Yellen and the bank is also to publish its forecasts on inflation and economic growth.\n\nU.K. jobs report and Bank of England minutes\n\nThe U.K. is to release official data on the unemployment rate. Market expectations are for the unemployment rate to remain unchanged at 7.2%, while the number of people claiming unemployment benefits is expected to continue to decline. The BoE is to publish the minutes of its March meeting. The BoE left interest rates on hold at 0.5% earlier this month, and reiterated that rates will remain at current levels for some time.\n\nNew Zealand GDP\n\nNew Zealand is to publish data on fourth quarter gross domestic product on Wednesday. Last week, the New Zealand dollar rallied to 10-month highs against the greenback after the Reserve Bank raised interest rates to 2.75% from a record low 2.5%, becoming the first developed nation to exit record-low borrowing costs. The bank also revised up its forecast for growth in the year to March 31.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.investing.com\/economic-calendar\/","89":"The Federal Reserve is set to trim its bond-buying stimulus for a third time in a row today, and will probably rewrite its guidance on when it might eventually raise interest rates.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is set to trim its bond-buying stimulus for a third time in a row today, and will probably rewrite its guidance on when it might eventually raise interest rates.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is set to trim its bond-buying stimulus for a third time in a row today, and will probably rewrite its guidance on when it might eventually raise interest rates.\n\nThe moves would represent both continuity at the U.S. central bank as Janet Yellen chairs her first policy-setting meeting and a nod to economic reality.\n\nA reduction in the Fed's monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities by $5bn each, as widely expected, would bring the monthly total to $55bn and keep the central bank on track for a measured wind down of the program as laid out by Yellen's predecessor, Ben Bernanke. Less certain is what the Fed will do about its interest rate guidance. It has said since December 2012 that it would not consider raising short-term rates until the jobless rate dropped to at least 6.5pc, as long as inflation looked set to remain contained.\n\nBut the unemployment rate has already dropped to 6.7pc, in part because of discouraged job hunters giving up the search, and officials think the economy is still far from ready for higher borrowing costs. Top Fed policymakers have indicated they are likely to scrap the numerical threshold and move to more qualitative guidance, but exactly how they will frame it is not certain.\n\nThe challenge they face is making the change without shifting market expectations for the timing of a first rate hike, now seen as coming midway through next year - in line with views also held by top Fed officials. Bank of the West chief economist Scott Anderson said the upshot will probably be \"a less transparent, and perhaps less helpful, qualitative statement\" of the economic conditions the Fed wants to see before raising rates.\n\nIt wants to ensure \"that another sharp decline in the unemployment rate for the wrong reasons doesn't send long-term interest rates soaring on expectations of an imminent rate hike,\" Anderson said. KEEPING MARKETS IN LINE\n\nThe Fed has kept overnight rates near zero since December 2008 and has bought more than $3 trillion in long-term debt to keep borrowing costs down and spur investment and hiring. It began to scale back its stimulus in December, announcing it would trim its monthly bond purchases by $10bn, after it saw the economy pick up speed in the fall. In January, the Fed said it would cut the purchases by a further $10bn.\n\nAt the same time, it has sought to tamp down any market expectations that rate rises will soon follow with its so-called forward guidance. But the jobless rate threshold could soon be breached, and officials want to find a more durable way to telegraph their view on when they will tighten monetary policy. They want to keep market expectations aligned with their own forecasts. If traders start to price in earlier rate hikes, the result would be tighter financial conditions that could deter the very investment and hiring that the Fed wants to promote.\n\nEven officials who prefer an earlier rate hike want the Fed's policy-setting committee to avoid surprises that could lead to market turmoil. \"I'm sure this committee will be interested in doing its best to communicate about what we foresee for policy,\" Jeffrey Lacker, the head of the Richmond Fed, said earlier this month.\n\nSeveral officials have signaled a preference for qualitative guidance around a broad set of economic indicators, including gauges for the labor market and inflation, which is tracking well below the Fed's 2 percent goal. The Fed is set to announce its decision in a statement at 2 p.m. That will be followed 30 minutes later by Yellen's first news conference since taking the helm of the world's most influential central bank on February 1. Many Fed officials, including Yellen, have said recent weakness in economic data, from jobs and retail sales to industrial production and home building, appears largely due to the unusually harsh winter and should soon dissipate.\n\nIf that assessment bears out, Fed officials have signaled they will likely end the bond-buying program later this year. On Wednesday, they will also release fresh projections for inflation, unemployment, economic growth and the likely path of rate hikes. Forecasts from December showed that most Fed officials saw rate hikes starting sometime next year and proceeding at a very gentle pace. With a shift away from guidance that relies on a specific level of the jobless rate, their views on the likely path of interest rates is likely to draw even more scrutiny.\n\nOnline Editors","90":"The Federal Reserve is seeking to clarify when it might start to raise short-term interest rates from record lows.\n\nFederal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen arrives at a news conference (Alex Wong\/Getty Images)\n\nThe Fed also says it will cut its monthly long-term bond purchases by another $10 billion to $55 billion because it thinks the economy is strong enough to support further improvements in the job market.\n\nThe Fed on Wednesday reaffirmed its plan to keep short-term rates low to help support the economy. But it no longer mentions a specific unemployment rate that might lead it eventually to raise short-term rates. The Fed says instead it will monitor \u201ca wide range of information\u201d on the job market, inflation and the economy before approving any rate increase.\n\nIt announced the policies in a statement after its first meeting with Janet Yellen as chair.\n\nOne reason for dropping a threshold unemployment rate, as Yellen among others have noted, is that the rate can overstate the job market\u2019s health. In recent months, for example, the unemployment rate has fallen not so much because of robust hiring but because many people without a job have stopped looking for one. Once people stop looking for a job, they\u2019re no longer counted as unemployed, and the rate can fall as a result.\n\nMore than five years ago, the Fed cut its benchmark short-term rate to a record low near zero, where it\u2019s remained since. Most analysts think the Fed will keep its target for short-term rates near zero until mid to late 2015.\n\nThe Fed also updated its economic forecasts Wednesday. Fed officials expect the U.S. economy to grow at a steady if modest pace in 2014 despite weather-related setbacks this winter.\n\nThe Fed is forecasting growth of 2.8 percent to 3 percent this year, a bit lower than its December projection of between 2.8 percent and 3.2 percent.\n\nThe forecast suggests that Fed policymakers will continue to pare their monthly bond purchases, which are intended to stimulate growth by keeping interest rates low. It is doing so despite challenges the U.S. economy and financial markets face, from a brutal winter that\u2019s depressed growth, to fears about how Russia\u2019s aggression toward Ukraine might slow the global economy.\n\n(Copyright 2014 The Associated Press.

It will be her first meeting as Fed chair, a position she assumed on 3 February, after Bernanke stepped down following eight high-profile years.\n\nAfter the Fed issues a statement at the end of its policy meeting and updates its economic forecasts, Yellen will preside over a news conference. She is widely expected to embrace Bernanke's approach of keeping interest rates low while gradually paring the Fed's economic stimulus.\n\nMost analysts expect the Fed to announce a third reduction in the monthly pace of its bond purchases from $65bn to $55bn. Those reductions are expected to continue this year until the bond purchases end altogether by December.\n\nThe Fed's bond purchases have been intended to keep long-term borrowing rates low to spur spending and growth. Its decision to continue paring them signals its belief that the economy is showing consistent improvement.\n\nMany analysts think the Fed could make one change in its statement on Wednesday. It may drop a reference to a specific unemployment rate that might cause it eventually to begin raising short-term rates.\n\nThe Fed's most recent policy statement said it planned to keep short-term rates at record lows \"well past\" the time the unemployment rate fell below 6.5%. The rate is now 6.7%. Several Fed officials have recently suggested scrapping the 6.5% threshold and instead describing more general changes in the job market and inflation that might trigger a rate increase.\n\nOne reason for dropping the threshold, as Yellen among others have noted, is that the unemployment rate can overstate the job market's health. In recent months, for example, the rate has fallen not so much because of robust hiring but because many people without a job have stopped looking for one. Once people stop looking for a job, they're no longer counted as unemployed, and the rate can fall as a result.\n\n\"There is a growing consensus to go with more nuance instead of a specific number,\" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial. \"I think they are just too close to 6.5% on the unemployment rate.\"\n\nYellen has spoken of seeking continuity with Bernanke, under whom she served as vice chair. That is one reason markets expect a further pullback in bond purchases.\n\nIf the gradual reductions were halted, it could raise concerns that the Fed has begun to worry about challenges the economy is facing, from a brutal winter that's depressed growth to fears about how Russia's aggression toward Ukraine might slow the global economy.\n\nFed officials, including Yellen, have signalled their belief that the weakness in U.S. economic data is temporary rather than a sign that the economy is losing momentum.\n\nThe Fed and most private economists foresee faster economic growth later this year. Many think the economy, which grew a lacklustre 1.9% in 2013, will rebound to around 3% this year.\n\n\"We had a tough start to the year with the winter storms, but it looks like we are starting to pull out of those weather effects,\" said David Jones, chief economist at DMJ Advisors.\n\nEconomists point to several hopeful signs \u2013 from a rebound in retail sales to an increase of 175,000 jobs in February despite continued harsh weather.\n\nEven if the economy strengthens and the Fed ends its bond purchases late this year, it will still be stimulating the economy. It has no plans to start selling its enormous portfolio of bonds \u2013 a step that would likely send loan rates up. Nor is it likely this year to raise the benchmark short-term rate it controls.\n\nMore than five years ago, the Fed cut that rate to a record low near zero, where it's remained since. Most analysts think the Fed will keep its target for short-term rates near zero until late 2015.\n\nNot all economists expect the Fed this week to drop a link between a specific unemployment rate and an eventual rate increase.\n\n\"I don't think they will tweak the language,\" said Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Tuft University. \"There is enough wiggle room currently.\"","93":"THIS afternoon, Janet Yellen will release her first Federal Open Market Committee statement as chair and give her first post-meeting press conference. Conventional wisdom is that tapering will continue at its recent pace, and that the FOMC will clarify its forward guidance. It almost certainly won't be announcing a plan to tolerate above-target inflation in order to accelerate the recovery, despite the wisdom of that course.\n\nIn fact, says Tim Duy, overshooting has been off the table since January of 2012, when the Fed announced an official 2% inflation target:\n\nThe Committee judges that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate.\n\nMr Duy adds:\n\nOn that day, the Federal Reserve locked in the definition of price stability. They locked it in specifically to prevent even the appearance they might deliberately overshoot as a result of extraordinary monetary policy. They locked it in as a commitment device to tie the hands of future policymakers as they would need to justify changing the definition of price stability, presumably a very high bar for any central banker to cross. On that day, the Federal Reserve took higher inflation expectations off the table. They pulled it from the toolkit. They made clear there is one and only one inflation target for all time. The only tolerable deviations from that target are essentially forecast errors. That's it.\n\nIt's a good post. I certainly agree that the mood of the Fed is not what one would call favourably disposed toward some overshooting. FOMC members came of age in the 1970s; as far as most of them are concerned it is never a bad time to trade off a little more unemployment for a little less inflation. Markets certainly don't expect any overshooting.\n\nBut I don't think it is as completely off the table as Mr Duy suggests, for a few reasons. First, policy statements are there to be changed, particularly when the facts justify a switch. At the time the 2% target was set, the median FOMC member projected that the fed funds rate would be 0.75% by the end of this year. Markets now anticipate rates reaching that level in 2016. The longer the Fed maintains its anachronistic policy position, the longer the American economy remains stuck against the zero lower bound. At some point, someone at the Fed may notice this.\n\nSecond, while hopes for a more ambitious policy agenda from Ms Yellen have diminished, it is still the case that there is no time for a regime change like a regime change. It's Ms Yellen's Fed now, and her committee may arrive at a different judgment than Mr Bernanke's. It almost certainly won't, but it could.\n\nThird, there is actually a lot of wiggle room around that 2% target. As recent experience has shown: the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures\u2014the magic indicator in the target statement\u2014has been below 2% since April of 2012. Indeed, over the past year inflation has been below 1.2% on average. One might argue that a steadfast commitment to a 2% inflation target demands some overshooting to make up for this long period of underperformance; after all, a central bank that tolerates undershooting of its target but not overshooting is missing its target on average.\n\nFourth, it's not clear that the Fed has entirely ruled out something of that nature. On the one hand, statements continue to note that the Fed will take a \"balanced approach\" as it begins to pull back on accommodation. On the other, it was not long ago seen as significant that the the head of the Fed's monetary affairs division was putting his name to research demonstrating the benefits of overshooting.\n\nThough it would be the right thing to do, I don't expect the Fed to announce a new 3% inflation target or 5% wage growth target, or declare its intention to make up half of the shortfall in nominal output relative to the pre-crisis trend. Though it would be a very good thing to do, I don't expect them to say that, in order to defend the integrity of their 2% inflation target, they intend to make up the shortfall in inflation accumulated over the past two years with an 18-month period of overshooting. But while I don't expect those things, I don't think they are entirely outside the realm of possibility, nor do I think that the Fed tied its hands forever in January of 2012.","94":"The Federal Reserve is set to trim its bond-buying stimulus for a third time in a row on Wednesday, and will probably rewrite its guidance on when it might eventually raise interest rates.\n\nThe moves would represent both continuity at the U.S. central bank as Janet Yellen chairs her first policy-setting meeting and a nod to economic reality.\n\nA reduction in the Fed's monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities by $5 billion each, as widely expected, would bring the monthly total to $55 billion and keep the central bank on track for a measured wind down of the program as laid out by Yellen's predecessor, Ben Bernanke.\n\nLess certain is what the Fed will do about its interest rate guidance. It has said since December 2012 that it would not consider raising short-term rates until the jobless rate dropped to at least 6.5 percent, as long as inflation looked set to remain contained.\n\nBut the unemployment rate has already dropped to 6.7 percent, in part because of discouraged job hunters giving up the search, and officials think the economy is still far from ready for higher borrowing costs.\n\nTop Fed policymakers have indicated they are likely to scrap the numerical threshold and move to more qualitative guidance, but exactly how they will frame it is not certain.\n\nThe challenge they face is making the change without shifting market expectations for the timing of a first rate hike, now seen as coming midway through next year - in line with views also held by top Fed officials.\n\nBank of the West chief economist Scott Anderson said the upshot will probably be \"a less transparent, and perhaps less helpful, qualitative statement\" of the economic conditions the Fed wants to see before raising rates.\n\nIt wants to ensure \"that another sharp decline in the unemployment rate for the wrong reasons doesn't send long-term interest rates soaring on expectations of an imminent rate hike,\" Anderson said.\n\nKEEPING MARKETS IN LINE\n\nThe Fed has kept overnight rates near zero since December 2008 and has bought more than $3 trillion in long-term debt to keep borrowing costs down and spur investment and hiring.\n\nIt began to scale back its stimulus in December, announcing it would trim its monthly bond purchases by $10 billion, after it saw the economy pick up speed in the fall. In January, the Fed said it would cut the purchases by a further $10 billion.\n\nAt the same time, it has sought to tamp down any market expectations that rate rises will soon follow with its so-called forward guidance. But the jobless rate threshold could soon be breached, and officials want to find a more durable way to telegraph their view on when they will tighten monetary policy.\n\nThey want to keep market expectations aligned with their own forecasts.

That will be followed 30 minutes later by Yellen's first news conference since taking the helm of the world's most influential central bank on Feb. 1.\n\nMany Fed officials, including Yellen, have said recent weakness in economic data, from jobs and retail sales to industrial production and home building, appears largely due to the unusually harsh winter and should soon dissipate.\n\nIf that assessment bears out, Fed officials have signaled they will likely end the bond-buying program later this year.\n\nOn Wednesday, they will also release fresh projections for inflation, unemployment, economic growth and the likely path of rate hikes.\n\nForecasts from December showed that most Fed officials saw rate hikes starting sometime next year and proceeding at a very gentle pace. With a shift away from guidance that relies on a specific level of the jobless rate, their views on the likely path of interest rates is likely to draw even more scrutiny.","95":"Page Not Found\n\nThe page you requested could not be found.

The kitchen table will do just fine.\n\nYellen is the first Fed leader in the central bank's 100 years to be married to an equally renowned economist - a Nobel laureate, no less. In 35 years of marriage, Yellen and George Akerlof have partnered on groundbreaking research on everything from the collapse of East Germany to out-of-wedlock births to the way generous pay for a baby sitter shows how wages motivate workers.\n\nColleagues say that as economic thinkers, the two complement each other. And they say their partnership reflects a philosophy of consensus and collaboration that's likely to surface in Yellen's leadership beginning with this week's meeting of the Fed's policy committee - the first since Yellen succeeded Ben Bernanke as chairman on Feb. 3.\n\nThe committee includes critics of the Fed's policymaking whose views Yellen doesn't tend to share. They include, for example, Richard Fisher, head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, who recently said the central bank is \"distorting financial markets\" by acting to depress short- and long-term interest rates.\n\nAs Akerlof's collaborator, as a professor and as the Fed's vice chairwoman, Yellen has been known for forging consensus. When she worked with Akerlof, the two drew upon each other's differing strengths, according to colleagues and former students.\n\n\"Janet is very balanced and grounded. She thinks clearly and has a lot of common sense,\" said Andrew Rose, an economist who collaborated with them at the University of California, Berkeley. \"George is much more artistic and has these leaps of brilliance.\"\n\nRose described Yellen as a mother who was devoted to helping her son with his pinewood derby car in the evenings. She would sit at favorite restaurants while drafting economic papers. In debating ideas with her husband, seemingly any assumption of how the economy functioned was ripe for debate.\n\n\"As far as I could tell, they did almost everything together,\" said Michael Ash, a student of Akerlof's and now an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.\n\nThe two might chew on problems separately, but the \"degree of communication, respect and a willingness to be playful in thinking\" distinguished them, Ash said.\n\nAkerlof, of course, can no longer afford to be as outspoken as he once was. He declined to comment for this article, mindful of how his words would be weighed for insights into what Yellen might be thinking.\n\nAkerlof has been critical in the past of the institution his wife leads and of other central banks. He's argued that there's a painful price to pay when a central bank focuses too much on avoiding higher inflation: sluggish hiring and meager pay.\n\nHis suggestion that the Fed should put more emphasis on job growth and accept the risk of higher inflation is among the most divisive issues Fed officials are debating.","98":"Today new Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Janet Yellen will head her very first policy meeting when the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) begins its two day policy meeting. This first meeting could be the most significant meeting of this early 2014.\n\nAfter the meeting concludes, we are expecting Yellen to announce, at the press conference, the Fed will likely use forward guidance towards interest rates. We also expect her to explain more how the FOMC will behave as the unemployment rate falls below its targeted 6.5 percent level. This is the level the Fed says they will raise rates once it goes below.\n\nEven though he has already testified before Congress and gave her views and opinions, she was limited due to the last FOMC decision. This is the first chance she will chair and the first view we get as to where she will take monetary policy going forward. We are expecting the FOMC to taper another $10 billion a month in purchases from $65 to $55 billion a month. Barring any unforeseen market shocks. We are also expecting the Fed to keep rates stable especially if inflation does not go above its target of two percent.\n\nSoft Economic Data Concerns the Fed\n\nSince the last fed meeting, and through the first quarter of 2014, economic data has come in softer than expected. A lot of this has been blamed on the severe winter covering most of North America but there are some concerns that some of it is actual slowing down of the recovery. We have seen some signs that the U.S. economy is about to come out of this rough patch, as industrial production beat analyst estimates coming out at 0.6 percent in February. We do expect the Fed to reduce its growth forecast as well as unemployment numbers for the year. The change will be very little.\n\nStill, as the Fed will still be buying assets, and could increase asset purchases at any time, it is unlikely this soft patch in data will prevent the Fed from pausing it\u2019s tapering of QE. Therefore we will put our focus on whether or not there will be forward guidance as to how long interest rates remain at near zero. There is a large majority of the FOMC membership leading towards qualitative guidance instead of a numerical number.\n\nThe New Forward Guidance Regime\n\nThe new forward guidance structure is likely to have three components:\n\nAsset purchases- this gives a minimum amount of time for rates to be able to rise. Inflation- which is gaining more and more relevance as the economy improves. A number of labor market indicators to judge employment conditions to give a better view of the situation than just unemployment alone.\n\nAsset purchases, or that element need no changes. The Fed is making purchases on a downward path that will see the end of QE by October or November. They will also maintain as super accommodative interest rate policy for a \u201cconsiderable time\u201d after QE ends. Interest rates will go up when the Fed decides it is time for them to go up. As far as inflation, the U.S. is in better shape than England for sure. Inflation seems to be returning slowly to its two percent target and should be there within the next 3 maybe 4 years.\n\nBottom line, the Fed is going to highlight that they will keep rates low as long as inflation is kept under control. We also expect them to bring less focus on the unemployment rate as it pertains to rate hikes.\n\nBinary Options Take for the Day:\n\nWatching interest rates and the spread between the 5 and 10 year yields. Depending on what the Fed says or does will impact the Dollar greatly. Any deviation can send the Dollar sharply lower. The euro still looks attractive as it remains bullish.\n\nDiscussion:\n\nThe Fed will reduce its QE again at this meeting and for the first time we will see what direction Janet Yellen will take the Fed as chair. What are your feelings? Do you think forward guidance is a good thing?","99":"\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON: The Federal Reserve is set to trim its bond-buying stimulus for a third time in a row on Wednesday, and will probably rewrite its guidance on when it might eventually raise interest rates.\n\nThe moves would represent continuity at the US central bank as Janet Yellen chairs her first policy-setting meeting, as well as a nod to economic reality.\n\nA reduction in the Fed's monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities by US$5bil each, as widely expected, would bring the monthly total to US$55bil and keep the central bank on track for a measured wind down of the program as laid out by Yellen's predecessor, Ben Bernanke.\n\nLess certain is what the Fed will do about its interest rate guidance.

Yellen is taking over the leadership of the Federal Reserve on the cusp of a more challenging period for the central bank.\n\n\n\nFor the last several years, Fed officials largely agreed that more had to be done to reduce unemployment and revive inflation. As the economy recovers, however, there are signs that old differences are returning even as the Fed emphasizes clear communication as its primary policy tool.\n\n\n\n\"It's a much tougher job to manage this committee than Bernanke had, because we're at more of a transitional point,\" said Julia Coronado, chief economist for North America at BNP Paribas, referring to Ben S. Bernanke, Yellen's predecessor. \"We're not in a crisis, we're kind of recovering to a degree - and then the question is, how much can monetary policy do?\"\n\n\n\nThe immediate challenge confronting Yellen, who as Fed chairwoman was to lead her first meeting of the Fed's policymaking committee on Tuesday and Wednesday, is to overhaul the Fed's forward guidance for short-term interest rates.\n\n\n\nThe Fed is gradually ending the expansion of its bond holdings, one aspect of its economic stimulus campaign. It is widely expected to announce Wednesday that it will add $55 billion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities in April, down from $65 billion in March and $85 billion each month last year. Fed officials say they intend to end purchases in the fall unless the economic outlook changes sharply.\n\n\n\nBut officials have offered much less clarity about the policy they regard as the centerpiece of the stimulus campaign, the Fed's effort to suppress borrowing costs for businesses and consumers not just by holding short-term interest rates near zero, but also by convincing investors that rates will remain low for some time.\n\n\n\nIn December 2012, the Fed said that it intended to keep short-term interest rates near zero at least as long as unemployment, which was 7.9 per cent at the time, remained above 6.5 per cent. Officials have since concluded that the rapid fall in the official unemployment rate - to 6.7 per cent in February - overstates the labor market's recovery. They agree that the Fed should tell investors that rates will remain low well past that threshold, but a small minority of officials are pushing for a clearly defined new threshold. Most officials instead want to provide a more general description of the economic objectives for the policy.\n\n\n\nThey argue that the task of calibrating monetary policy is inherently becoming more complicated as the economy recovers, like the difference between sailing quickly toward an island and then maneuvering slowly into the harbor.\n\n\n\nJohn C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said that describing the Fed's plans in terms of a broader set of economic indicators would be more vague, but also more accurate. \"How to do that without going to dates and using numbers, that will be the art of crafting how we communicate,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe Bank of England last month made a similar shift, replacing a statement that it intended to keep interest rates at a low level at least as long as British unemployment remained above 7 per cent with a long description of the factors it planned to consider before raising rates, emphasizing that the economy still had considerable \"spare capacity.\" Some Fed officials, including William C. Dudley, the influential president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, have cited that \"qualitative rather than quantitative\" approach as a useful model.\n\n\n\nA shift toward descriptive guidance could diminish the potency of the Fed's effort to suppress interest rates if investors find the goals less clear or more likely to shift. The Bank of England has struggled to dissuade investors who continue to bet that it will raise rates sooner than the timetable implied by its forecasts.\n\n\n\nBut the Fed is unlikely to face an immediate test of its credibility because the economy remains weak. \"Their job is being made easier by the fact that the data is reinforcing their message of patience,\" Coronado said. \"In contrast to the Bank of England, which is fighting strong data and trying to convince the market that they're going to be low for long, everyone believes the Fed right now.\"\n\n\n\n","103":">> Page not found\n\n\n\n\n\nThe page you have requested might no longer exist, has had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable.\n\n\n\nSuggestions:\n\n\n\n\u0095 If you typed the page address\/URL, make sure it is spelt correctly.\n\n\n\n\u0095 Open the Indiatimes.com homepage or sitemap and look for links to the information you want.\n\n\n\n\u0095 Use the \"Back\" button on your browser to return to the previous page.\n\n\n\n","104":"The moves would represent both continuity at the US central bank as Janet Yellen chairs her first policy-setting meeting and a nod to economic reality.

Reuters","105":"* Fed on track to reduce monthly bond buys to $55 billion\n\n* U.S. central bank may also rewrite interest rate promise\n\n* Yellen holds first news conference as Fed chair\n\n* New economic and rate projections also on tap\n\nBy Ann Saphir\n\nWASHINGTON, March 19 The Federal Reserve is set to trim its bond-buying stimulus for a third time in a row on Wednesday, and will probably rewrite its guidance on when it might eventually raise interest rates.\n\nThe moves would represent both continuity at the U.S. central bank as Janet Yellen chairs her first policy-setting meeting and a nod to economic reality.\n\nA reduction in the Fed's monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities by $5 billion each, as widely expected, would bring the monthly total to $55 billion and keep the central bank on track for a measured wind down of the program as laid out by Yellen's predecessor, Ben Bernanke.\n\nLess certain is what the Fed will do about its interest rate guidance. It has said since December 2012 that it would not consider raising short-term rates until the jobless rate dropped to at least 6.5 percent, as long as inflation looked set to remain contained.\n\nBut the unemployment rate has already dropped to 6.7 percent, in part because of discouraged job hunters giving up the search, and officials think the economy is still far from ready for higher borrowing costs.\n\nTop Fed policymakers have indicated they are likely to scrap the numerical threshold and move to more qualitative guidance, but exactly how they will frame it is not certain.\n\nThe challenge they face is making the change without shifting market expectations for the timing of a first rate hike, now seen as coming midway through next year - in line with views also held by top Fed officials.\n\nBank of the West chief economist Scott Anderson said the upshot will probably be \"a less transparent, and perhaps less helpful, qualitative statement\" of the economic conditions the Fed wants to see before raising rates.\n\nIt wants to ensure \"that another sharp decline in the unemployment rate for the wrong reasons doesn't send long-term interest rates soaring on expectations of an imminent rate hike,\" Anderson said.\n\nKEEPING MARKETS IN LINE\n\nThe Fed has kept overnight rates near zero since December 2008 and has bought more than $3 trillion in long-term debt to keep borrowing costs down and spur investment and hiring.\n\nIt began to scale back its stimulus in December, announcing it would trim its monthly bond purchases by $10 billion, after it saw the economy pick up speed in the fall. In January, the Fed said it would cut the purchases by a further $10 billion.\n\nAt the same time, it has sought to tamp down any market expectations that rate rises will soon follow with its so-called forward guidance. But the jobless rate threshold could soon be breached, and officials want to find a more durable way to telegraph their view on when they will tighten monetary policy.\n\nThey want to keep market expectations aligned with their own forecasts.

Officials see it as too limiting a measure in making decisions on interest rates. In a statement the Fed said it would \"assess progress\u2026toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.\"\n\n\u201cThe slightly more rapid improvement in the unemployment picture might help explain an upward shift in [economic recovery outlook data,\" said Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen. \"I would simply warn you that these dots [data points] are going to move up and down over time\u2026 the end of 2016 is a long way out.\u201d\n\nBack in 2012, the Fed set an unemployment target of 6.5 percent, in an effort to send a signal that interest rates would stay low. Really low. For a long, long time.\n\nDavid Wessel, head of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution, says if you imagine you are the Fed, \u201cYou tell them, look, we are going to keep rates near zero until unemployment gets to 6.5 percent, and that seems to be an eternity away.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, now it\u2019s March 2014,\u201d Wessel says, \u201cand unemployment is almost at this 6.5 percent threshold.\u201d\n\nThe unemployment rate is currently 6.7 percent. But the Fed isn\u2019t ready to bail on those low interest rates.\n\nThat 6.5 percent unemployment rate doesn\u2019t represent the economic promised land it once did.\n\n\u201cWe have to be a little bit careful about what goes into calculating that rate,\u201d says Victor Li, an economics professor at Villanova University. The unemployment rate doesn\u2019t fall just because a whole lot of people have found new jobs. \u201cIt can also go down because of people who are dropping out of the labor force,\u201d Li says, \u201cpeople who have become discouraged.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s been happening.\n\nPaul Brent\/Marketplace\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find one number that really describes the unemployment rate,\u201d Wessel, from Brookings, says, \u201cand the labor market, and what\u2019s happening to people dropping out of the job market.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the Fed this will describe its economic goals, instead of any specific number.","109":"I almost fell off my chair when I read the Bloomberg headline:\n\nFischer on Bailouts\n\nThis is Stanley Fischer, the not yet confirmed nominee to be Fed vice-chair, former head of Israel's central bank and former thesis advisor to Ben Bernanke and Mario Draghi, voicing an opinion about potential Fed policy [emphasis added]:\n\nStanley Fischer, the nominee to be Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s top lieutenant, said governments must devise measures to ensure taxpayer dollars are never used again to save a failing bank.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is critical to develop now the tools needed to deal with potential future crises without injecting public funds,\u201d Fischer said in the text of remarks prepared for a speech today in Stanford, California.\n\n\n\nEfforts to avert future crises are driven \u201cby the view that we should never again be in a situation in which the public sector has to inject public money into failing financial institutions in order to mitigate a financial crisis,\u201d he said.\n\nFischer is a former central banker and the breed is normally reserved in their public statements. However, his stature as an elder statesman does allow him some leeway and such views no doubt holds a great deal of sway in the halls of the Federal Reserve.\n\n\n\nI was always of the opinion that the bankers should never have been bailed out they way they did. The Swedish solution of offering a nationalization solution if a bank could not find private financing was the better solution. At the height of the crisis, the funds allocated to TARP could have bought the equity of the entire BKX Bank Index.\n\n\n\nWhile such a change in policy amounts to shutting the barn door after the horse has bolted, it nevertheless amounts to a brand new direction at the Yellen Fed.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, the nuances of the FOMC statement seems insignificant compared to this development.

(Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP)\n\nJanet Yellen, the new Federal Reserve chair, is affectionately referred to as the \"Fairy Godmother of the Bull Market\" by investment strategist Edward Yardeni. The reason: Stock prices tend to climb whenever she speaks publicly about the economy and monetary policy.\n\nThat bullish correlation is relevant now, as Yellen will preside at her first press conference Wednesday afternoon after the Fed's two-day meeting wraps up.\n\nIs \"more fairy dust coming from Yellen?\" The answer, says Yardeni, is yes. He expects the Fed's first female chief to live up to her dovish (i.e., market-friendly) reputation. Yardeni expects Yellen to tweak the central bank's forward \"guidance\" that supports a longer period of its near zero percent interest rate policy, or ZIRP, despite the improving economy.\n\nThat worries Yardeni. He fears ZIRP is \"inflating speculative bubbles in markets.\" He says more talk of easy money \"could set the stage for a stock market melt-up,\" especially if the economy picks up when the weather turns warmer. The latest sign of a bubble mentality, he says, is the \"excitement\" about the impending U.S. IPO offering of Chinese Internet darling Alibaba.\n\nTRACK STOCKS : Get real-time quotes with our free Portfolio Tracker\n\nYardeni wonders what Yellen will do \"if the economy comes roaring back this spring and stock prices go vertical.\" His guess: She might \"raise margin requirements\" (or ask investors to pony up more collateral before borrowing money to buy stocks) \"to take the air out of any stock bubbles.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http:\/\/usat.ly\/1gMJrwC","113":"Page not found\n\nWe\u2019re sorry.

She thinks clearly and has a lot of common sense,\" said Andrew Rose, an economist who collaborated with them at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n\"George is much more artistic and has these leaps of brilliance.\"\n\nRose described Yellen as a mother who was devoted to helping her son with his pinewood derby car in the evenings. She would sit at favourite restaurants while drafting economic papers.\n\nIn debating ideas with her husband, seemingly any assumption of how the economy functioned was ripe for debate.\n\n\"As far as I could tell, they did almost everything together,\" said Michael Ash, a student of Akerlof's and now an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.\n\nThe two might chew on problems separately, but the \"degree of communication, respect and a willingness to be playful in thinking\" distinguished them, Ash said.\n\nAkerlof, of course, can no longer afford to be as outspoken as he once was. He declined to comment for this article, mindful of how his words would be weighed for insights into what Yellen might be thinking.\n\nThe 73-year old economist recently stepped down from an unpaid advisory position at the University of Zurich backed by the Swiss bank UBS \"to avoid the appearance of a conflict,\" he wrote in an email.\n\nSince officially becoming Fed chair, Yellen has declined to speak publicly to reporters.\n\nOn Wednesday, she will hold a news conference after the Fed meeting ends.\n\nAkerlof has been critical in the past of the institution his wife leads and of other central banks.\n\nHe's argued that there's a painful price to pay when a central bank focuses too much on avoiding higher inflation: sluggish hiring and meager pay.\n\nHis suggestion that the Fed should put more emphasis on job growth and accept the risk of higher inflation is among the most divisive issues Fed officials are debating.\n\nUnemployment remains at a still-high 6.7 per cent nearly a half-decade into the economic recovery.\n\nThe Fed's investment portfolio has roughly quadrupled to more than US$4 trillion ($4.7t) since the recession began in late 2007.\n\nThat's because the Fed has tried to spur growth by buying Treasury and mortgage bonds to keep long-term loan rates low.\n\nSuper-low borrowing rates are intended to drive spending, growth and hiring. But rates kept too low for too long risk causing sharp price spikes that could disrupt the economy.\n\nSo far, inflation hasn't become a threat. In fact, it's running below the Fed's 2 per cent target.\n\nThe Fed has recently lowered the pace of its monthly bond buying from US$85 billion ($99.5b) to US$65b, a figure that could fall further after this week's meeting.\n\nYet the Fed continues to maintain that short-term rates will stay near zero.\n\nYellen told members of Congress that extremely low inflation \"gives us ample scope to continue to try to promote a return to full employment.\"\n\nHer husband has been blunter about the possible trade-offs between inflation and job growth.\n\n\"Most of us think of central bankers as cautious, conservative and safe,\" Akerlof said in his 2001 Nobel Prize lecture.\n\n\"But I consider many to be dangerous drivers: To avoid the oncoming traffic of inflation, they drive on the far edge of the road, keeping inflation too low and unemployment too high.\"\n\nHis speech suggested that higher inflation would spur workers to demand pay raises because higher prices would squeeze their existing income.\n\nFed watchers usually classify this perspective as \"dovish\" - a willingness to keep pumping cash into the economy at a pace that could alarm inflation \"hawks.\"\n\nStill, Akerlof's former students said this classification underplays the depth and independence of his analysis.\n\n\"To call Akerlof 'dovish' is to vastly underrate the seriousness of his thought,\" said John Cochrane, a finance professor at the University of Chicago who studied under Akerlof at Berkeley.\n\n\"He's a brilliant economist and unmotivated by ideology or partisanship.\"\n\nYellen, too, has been classified as dovish.

When she first joined the Fed's board nearly 20 years ago, Yellen feared that Berkeley might let her go and her colleagues might forget her.\n\nSo she gave her colleague Andrew Rose a photo, which other professors turned into a shrine with a votive candle, a few sculptures and even rosary beads, Rose said.\n\nAkerlof took a leave from his professorship at Berkeley to join his wife in Washington. He accepted positions at the Brookings Institution and, now, as a scholar in residence at the International Monetary Fund.\n\nStatements from the two about the plight of the long-term unemployed since the Great Recession have noticeably overlapped.\n\nAt a Brookings panel in April 2011, Akerlof said he'd \"never seen anything like\" the more than 45 per cent of the unemployed who had been jobless for more than six months, a share that has since slipped to a still-high 37 per cent.\n\n\"It makes life hell for the people who are unemployed,\" Akerlof bluntly declared.\n\nLikewise, in her first congressional hearing as Fed chair last month, Yellen repeated her fears that the recovery had been too weak to help many of the recession's victims.\n\n\"The fact that we have very long spells of unemployment,\" she told a House committee, \"suggests that the job market is not strong enough to be able to provide people with jobs who want to work.\"\n\n- AP","116":"CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

This would be the first time the Fed has tightened monetary policy since the summer of 2006. The dots are each of the top Fed officials\u2019 best guess. (There are usually 19 members on the Fed policy committee but there are three vacancies on the central bank\u2019s board of governors.)\n\nThe Bernanke Fed started providing the dots in 2012. They will be released at 2 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday along with a statement, that is expected to alter the Fed\u2019s promise to keep rates low for a long time. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen will hold his first press conference at 2:30 p.m. on Wednesday.\n\nIn its last published forecast last December, the median estimate of 17 Fed officials expected for the fed funds rate to rise from zero to 0.75% by the end of 2015 and 1.75% by the end of 2016, Lavorgna said.\n\nIf there are no changes to the dots at this meeting, then the fed funds futures market might not react to the expected language changes, he said.\n\nAt the moment, the Fed has pledged to keep rates at zero well past the point where the unemployment rate falls below 6.5% as long as inflation doesn\u2019t get in the way.\n\nLavorgna and many other economists think the Fed will ditch the 6.5% threshold in favor of a broad array of indicators \u2013 so less transparency.\n\nFed officials will also release their latest projections for the economy.\n\nEconomists don\u2019t think there will be many changes since the December projections as winter snowstorms have obscured underlying economic conditions.\n\nIn December, the Fed saw the unemployment rate falling to a range between 6.3% and 6.6% this year and then to 5.8% to 6.1% by the end of 2015.\n\nThe Fed sees year-on-year inflation in a range of 1.4% to 1.6% this year, not approaching its target of 2.0% until 2015.\n\nThe central bank was upbeat about the economy in December, seeing growth in a range of 2.8% to 3.2% in 2014 and then staying north of 3% in the following year.\n\n\u2013 Greg Robb\n\nFollow Greg on Twitter @grobb2000\n\nFollow Capitol Report @capitolreport\n\nMore must reads on MarketWatch:\n\nAn interactive look at the evolution of the Fed\u2019s forward guidance\n\nFed set to roll out new low-rate pledge\n\nWhat\u2019s your question for Yellen","119":"The Federal Reserve is expected to continue dialing back monetary stimulus at its monthly meeting.\n\nIt concludes on Wednesday with new Fed Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s first news conference.\n\nJournalists will try to pin her down on when the US central bank will start putting up the cost of borrowing.\n\nThey are not likely to get a direct answer, but a number of Fed officials have indicated they are comfortable with market expectations for an interest rate rise sometime around the middle of next year.\n\nWith US job growth accelerating and industrial production and consumer spending strengthening, economists expect the policymakers to announce another $10 billion reduction to the monthly bond purchases which have been used to stimulate the economy.","120":"WASHINGTON \u2014 As the Federal Reserve\u2019s new leader, Janet Yellen won\u2019t have to go far to bounce ideas off a fellow economist. The kitchen table will do just fine.\n\nYellen is the first Fed leader in the central bank\u2019s 100 years to be married to an equally renowned economist \u2014 a Nobel laureate, no less. In 35 years of marriage, Yellen and George Akerlof have partnered on groundbreaking research on everything from the collapse of East Germany to out-of-wedlock births to the way generous pay for a baby sitter shows how wages motivate workers.\n\nAdditional Photos In this Monday, Feb. 3, 2014, file photo, Janet Yellen, followed by her husband, Nobel Prize winning economist George Akerlof, smiles as she walks into a room of applause by staff members before she is administered the oath of office as Federal Reserve Board chair, at the Federal Reserve in Washington. The Associated Press Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\n\nColleagues say that as economic thinkers, the two complement each other. And they say their partnership reflects a philosophy of consensus and collaboration that\u2019s likely to surface in Yellen\u2019s leadership beginning with this week\u2019s meeting of the Fed\u2019s policy committee \u2014 the first since Yellen succeeded Ben Bernanke as chair on Feb. 3.\n\nThe committee includes critics of the Fed\u2019s policymaking whose views Yellen doesn\u2019t tend to share. They include, for example, Richard Fisher, head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, who recently said the central bank is \u201cdistorting financial markets\u201d by acting to depress short- and long-term interest rates.\n\nAs Akerlof\u2019s collaborator, as a professor and as the Fed\u2019s vice chair, Yellen has been known for forging consensus. When she worked with Akerlof, the two drew upon each other\u2019s differing strengths, according to colleagues and former students.\n\n\u201cJanet is very balanced and grounded. She thinks clearly and has a lot of common sense,\u201d said Andrew Rose, an economist who collaborated with them at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cGeorge is much more artistic and has these leaps of brilliance.\u201d\n\nRose described Yellen as a mother who was devoted to helping her son with his pinewood derby car in the evenings. She would sit at favorite restaurants while drafting economic papers. In debating ideas with her husband, seemingly any assumption of how the economy functioned was ripe for debate.\n\n\u201cAs far as I could tell, they did almost everything together,\u201d said Michael Ash, a student of Akerlof\u2019s and now an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.\n\nThe two might chew on problems separately, but the \u201cdegree of communication, respect and a willingness to be playful in thinking\u201d distinguished them, Ash said.\n\nAkerlof, of course, can no longer afford to be as outspoken as he once was. He declined to comment for this article, mindful of how his words would be weighed for insights into what Yellen might be thinking.\n\nThe 73-year old economist recently stepped down from an unpaid advisory position at the University of Zurich backed by the Swiss bank UBS \u201cto avoid the appearance of a conflict,\u201d he wrote in an email.\n\nSince officially becoming Fed chair, Yellen has declined to speak publicly to reporters. On Wednesday, she will hold a news conference after the Fed meeting ends.\n\nAkerlof has been critical in the past of the institution his wife leads and of other central banks. He\u2019s argued that there\u2019s a painful price to pay when a central bank focuses too much on avoiding higher inflation: sluggish hiring and meager pay.\n\nHis suggestion that the Fed should put more emphasis on job growth and accept the risk of higher inflation is among the most divisive issues Fed officials are debating.\n\nUnemployment remains at a still-high 6.7 percent nearly a half-decade into the economic recovery. The Fed\u2019s investment portfolio has roughly quadrupled to more than $4 trillion since the recession began in late 2007. That\u2019s because the Fed has tried to spur growth by buying Treasury and mortgage bonds to keep long-term loan rates low.\n\nSuper-low borrowing rates are intended to drive spending, growth and hiring. But rates kept too low for too long risk causing sharp price spikes that could disrupt the economy. So far, inflation hasn\u2019t become a threat. In fact, it\u2019s running below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target.\n\nThe Fed has recently lowered the pace of its monthly bond buying from $85 billion to $65 billion, a figure that could fall further after this week\u2019s meeting. Yet the Fed continues to maintain that short-term rates will stay near zero.\n\nYellen told members of Congress that extremely low inflation \u201cgives us ample scope to continue to try to promote a return to full employment.\u201d\n\nHer husband has been blunter about the possible trade-offs between inflation and job growth.\n\n\u201cMost of us think of central bankers as cautious, conservative and safe,\u201d Akerlof said in his 2001 Nobel Prize lecture. \u201cBut I consider many to be dangerous drivers: To avoid the oncoming traffic of inflation, they drive on the far edge of the road, keeping inflation too low and unemployment too high.\u201d\n\nHis speech suggested that higher inflation would spur workers to demand pay raises because higher prices would squeeze their existing income.\n\nFed watchers usually classify this perspective as \u201cdovish\u201d \u2014 a willingness to keep pumping cash into the economy at a pace that could alarm inflation \u201chawks.\u201d Still, Akerlof\u2019s former students said this classification underplays the depth and independence of his analysis.\n\n\u201cTo call Akerlof \u00e2\u0080\u0098dovish\u2019 is to vastly underrate the seriousness of his thought,\u201d said John Cochrane, a finance professor at the University of Chicago who studied under Akerlof at Berkeley. \u201cHe\u2019s a brilliant economist and unmotivated by ideology or partisanship.\u201d\n\nYellen, too, has been classified as dovish. In the past, she has suggested that inflation above 2 percent would be temporarily acceptable if it sped the pace of hiring.\n\nThe couple first met at a Fed cafeteria in 1977. He had already achieved some measure of fame for his 1970 paper \u201cThe Market for Lemons.\u201d In it, Akerlof demonstrated through used cars the economic problems caused when a seller has more information than a would-be buyer does. It was an insight, in part, that led to his sharing a Nobel prize decades later.\n\nWhile Yellen and Akerlof were teaching at Berkeley in the 1980s, their search for a baby sitter for their son, Robert, now an economist teaching in Britain, inspired a 1990 research paper about wages. The couple willingly paid a premium for baby sitters, figuring it would attract superior talent.\n\nTheir research found that employees tend to slack off once their pay falls below a \u201cfair wage.\u201d This trend, in turn, contributes to unemployment because many people don\u2019t want to work for pay they deem unfairly low, they found.\n\nYellen\u2019s multiple periods in Washington influenced each other\u2019s career paths.

Since then $20 billion has been trimmed from the monthly purchases, taking them to $65 billion.\n\nBut the downturn in economic activity has given Fed policy makers pause to be sure the taper is appropriate.\n\nMost economists blame the slowdown on the harsh winter storms that battered the eastern half of the United States between December and February.\n\nYellen showed her bias toward that explanation in late February, when she told a Senate panel that \"it is clear that unseasonably cold weather has played some role.\"\n\nA week later, the Fed Beige Book survey of regional economies cited the weather 119 times in explaining sluggish activity.\n\nEconomists thus expect the FOMC to decide that the economy is reasonably strong, and cut another $10 billion from its bond purchases.\n\nBut they want to see whether the FOMC adjusts its rate-hike thresholds, of inflation topping 2.5 percent and unemployment falling below 6.5 percent.\n\nInflation is still just 1.1 percent, but the jobless rate was very close at 6.7 percent last month.\n\nAnalysts say that makes the Fed's guidance for rate-change expectations mixed: the jobless threshold points to an early rate rise, while the tabulated forecasts of the FOMC members put any hike at late 2015.\n\nYellen and others on the FOMC say the official 6.7 percent rate does not reflect the full extent of un- and under-employment in the economy. New York Fed President Bill Dudley last week called the 6.5 percent threshold \"obsolete\"and said it would be good to \"revamp\" that guidance.\n\nMost analysts expect the FOMC to lower or eliminate the numerical target and switch to more qualitative guidance on their rate-rise expectations.\n\nOne issue that could possibly hold up that change is that two new members of the FOMC still await confirmation by the US Senate.\n\nSo Yellen might be reticent to make any policy move before all FOMC members are on board.\n\nEyes then will be on any adjustments to the forecasts of the FOMC members for growth, inflation, and when they foresee the fed funds rate moving off the bottom.\n\nIn December, all but two of the 17 members present saw the rate unmoved through the end of this year, while only three saw it staying at that level in 2015.\n\nMost however believed it would be at 1.0 percent or lower at the end of 2015 -- an indication that they saw inflation remaining a non-threat through next year.","123":"That was good enough to virtually ensure that the Fed will announce a further cut of $10 billion in its monthly asset purchases split evenly between Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Yellen is not so dovish that she would reverse former Chairman Ben Bernanke's plans to end quantitative easing unless conditions get markedly worse.\n\nAnd many Wall Street prognosticators believe a good deal of the softness in economic data in January and February was weather-related and will get reversed in the spring. Morgan Stanley put out a note on Tuesday arguing that if you correct for the effects of the unusually harsh winter \"domestic spending retains vigor \u2026 After Q1, the economy should rebound like an uncoiling spring on the expression of pent-up demand. Over our forecast horizon, real GDP expands at a 2.7 percent pace this year \u2026 and only a touch slower in 2015.\"\n\nSo at least on the top headline level, Yellen is not likely to make big news. But there's still plenty at stake, both politically and for markets.\n\n(Read more: Geopolitical uncertainty clouds view on Fed outlook: CNBCsurvey)\n\nThe FOMC is expected to back away from its target unemployment rate of 6.5 percent as a signal for the timing of rate hikes. Joblessness is now at 6.7 percent, but few would argue that the labor market is healthy. There is a great deal of debate about just how much \"slack\" there is and how much lower the unemployment rate can go given that the short-term jobless rate is at 4.2 percent, back below prerecession levels. Is the natural unemployment rate now just significantly higher? Are the long-term jobless simply never coming back to the labor market?\n\nAnything Yellen says about this will be market moving and draw extensive commentary.\n\nWill she be specific in what data points beyond the unemployment rate the Fed will use to decide when it is time to consider rate hikes? Will she invoke the quits rate? Or the long-term jobless rate? Or will she refer to a vague group of \"other factors?\"\n\nShe will also be asked what she thinks of the uptick in wage growth to 2 percent. Is that a worrisome sign of nascent wage inflation that the Fed must worry about? Or is it just a statistical fluke brought on by the cold winter keeping lower paid workers on the sidelines?\n\n(Read more: Efforts to kill Fannie-Freddie may already be dead)\n\nYellen is likely stick to a fairly tight script suggesting the Fed is watching all of these things but still believes near-zero interest rate policy is warranted until well after the jobless rate hits 6.5 percent. But if she breaks any new ground at all it could hit both stock and bond prices.\n\nOn the political front, Democrats will be eager to see the Yellen they know and love, solidly dovish and pledging to keep rates low and not speed up the taper throughout this midterm election year.\n\nThe party is in enough trouble with a sluggish economy and an unpopular health-care law and incumbent president likely to cost them seats in the House and possible control of the Senate. The last thing they want to see is the Fed chair tapping the breaks and slowing the economy even further.","124":"404\n\nSorry, the page you requested was not found.\n\nPlease check the URL for mistakes.

Forensic work is under way to try to recover it, he said.\n\n-- Malaysian authorities have received background information from all countries with passengers on board the plane except Russia and Ukraine. So far, no information of significance has been found about any passengers, Hishammuddin said.\n\n-- Malaysia has received some radar data from other countries, he said, but \"we are not at liberty to release information from other countries.\"\n\n-- Reports that the plane was sighted by people in the Maldives are \"not true,\" Hishammuddin said, citing the Chief of the Malaysian Defense Force who contacted his counterpart in the Maldives.\n\nThe Malaysian media is also reporting that a half-dozen landing strips were found on the flight simulator inside the home of the 53-year-old pilot. Those include landing strips in the Indian Ocean, Maldives, and Sri Lanka.\n\nThe FBI is reviewing the hard drive on the flight simulator taken from the home.\n\nTicking clock\n\nThe latest news conference took place as the clock ticked on search efforts.\n\nThe box containing the flight-data and cockpit-voice recorders of the missing plane has batteries designed to keep it sending out pings for 30 days. That leaves 18 days until the batteries are expected to run out.\n\nInvestigators hope the recorders may reveal vital information about why the passenger jet carrying 239 people veered dramatically off course and disappeared from radar screens. But they have to find them first.\n\n\"The odds of finding the pinger are very slim,\" said Rob McCallum, an ocean search specialist. \"Even when you know roughly where the target is, it can be very tricky to find the pinger. They have a very limited range.\"\n\nTechnology put to use\n\nSome of the nations involved in the hunt are deploying an impressive array of technology, including satellites and high-tech submarine-hunting planes, as they try to narrow the search area.\n\nThey're also trawling through existing radar and satellite data for clues.\n\nAustralia said Wednesday that the area of the southern Indian Ocean where it is searching for the plane has been \"significantly refined.\"\n\nThe new area is based on work done by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board on \"the fuel reserves of the aircraft and how far it could have flown,\" said John Young of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority.\n\nBut Australian ships and aircraft have so far seen nothing connected to the missing plane, Australian authorities said.\n\nSmall details emerge\n\nMuch of what has emerged in recent days has filled in a few more details about the early part of the missing Boeing 777-200's flight.\n\nBut clear information on what went on in the cockpit and where exactly the errant jet went after it vanished from Malaysian military radar remains frustratingly elusive.\n\nOn Tuesday, for example, a law enforcement official told CNN that the aircraft's first major change of course was almost certainly programmed by somebody in the cockpit. The change was entered into the plane's system at least 12 minutes before a person in the cockpit, believed to be the co-pilot, signed off to air traffic controllers.\n\nBut that disclosure only left more questions about the reason behind the reprogrammed flight path.\n\nSome experts said the change in direction could have been part of an alternate flight plan programmed in advance in case of emergency; others suggested it could show something more nefarious was afoot.\n\nAnd Hishammuddin said Wednesday that \"there is no additional waypoint on MH370's documented flight plan, which depicts normal routing all the way to Beijing.\"\n\nThe Thai military, meanwhile, said it had spotted the plane turning west toward the Strait of Malacca early on March 8. That supports the analysis of Malaysian military radar that has the plane flying out over the Strait of Malacca and into the Indian Ocean.\n\nBut it didn't make it any clearer where the plane went next. Authorities say information from satellites suggests the plane kept flying for about six hours after it was last detected by Malaysian military radar.\n\nWho was at the controls?\n\nMalaysian authorities, who are coordinating the search, say the available evidence suggests the missing plane flew off course in a deliberate act by someone who knew what they were doing.\n\nFiguring out who that might be has so far left investigators stumped.\n\nParticular attention has focused on the pilot and first officer on Flight 370, but authorities are yet to come up with any evidence explaining why either of them would have taken the jetliner off course.\n\nAnd some experts have warned against hastily jumping to conclusions about the role of the pilots.\n\n\"I've worked on many cases were the pilots were suspect, and it turned out to be a mechanical and horrible problem,\" said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. \"And I have a saying myself: Sometimes an erratic flight path is heroism, not terrorism\n\nChina says it has found nothing suspicious during background checks on its citizens on the flight -- a large majority of the plane's passengers.\n\nSearchers face deep ocean\n\nHishammuddin, the country's public face of the search efforts, has repeatedly said at news conferences that little is likely to be established about the mysterious flight until the plane is found.\n\nBut in the Indian Ocean, where Australia and Indonesia have taken the lead in the hunt, some of the depths searchers are dealing with are significant.\n\nThe Bay of Bengal, for example, which lies between Myanmar and India, has depths of between about 4,000 and 7,000 meters (13,000 feet and 23,000 feet), according to McCallum.\n\nWreckage and bodies of passengers from Air France Flight 447, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009, were found at depths of around 12,000 feet by unmanned submarines.\n\nIt took four searches over the course of nearly two years to locate the bulk of the wreckage and the majority of the bodies of the 228 people on board Flight 447. It took even longer to establish the cause of the disaster.\n\nRight now, authorities don't even know for sure if the missing Malaysian plane crashed or landed -- or where.\n\nCNN has talked to more than half a dozen U.S. military and intelligence officials who emphasize that while no one knows what happened to the plane, it is more logical to conclude it crashed into the Indian Ocean.\n\nCNN's Brian Todd, David Fitzpatrick, Kyung Lah, Mitra Mobasherat, Atika Shubert, Evan Perez, Mariano Castillo and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","136":"Never miss a great news story!\n\nGet instant notifications from Economic Times\n\nAllowNot now\n\nYou can switch off notifications anytime using browser settings.","137":"Twelve days into the mystery of what happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and the 239 people on board, more clues seem to raise only more questions.\n\nThe latest news about the investigation and search for the plane includes:\n\n-- An NBC News report that sources familiar with the investigation say data from the plane's communications systems indicate someone manually programmed a turn into the Boeing 777's navigation system 12 minutes before a voice from the cockpit said, \"All right, good night,\" to Malaysian air traffic controllers.\n\nIf that is what happened, it could mean that whoever was at the controls had already planned a sharp turn to the west \u2014 well off the jet's planned Kuala Lumpur-to-Beijing route \u2014 before the seemingly routine sign-off.\n\nThat turn is why the search for the jet has extended thousands of miles south across the Indian Ocean and thousands of miles north into Central Asia.\n\nAuthorities have said they believe the voice heard saying good night was that of co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid.\n\nWhether he or pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah or someone else programmed a course change into the navigation system is not known.\n\nAccounts have varied as to exactly when that occurred. Also in the minutes around that good night message is when most of the plane's communications and tracking systems went dark. The lack of data from those systems is why the search area is so vast \u2014 authorities aren't sure which direction the plane went after it headed west.\n\n-- Word from Malaysian officials that some files were recently deleted \u2014 perhaps in early February \u2014 from a flight simulator in the home of Flight 370 pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah. Investigators are attempting to restore the files to see if they have any connection to the missing jet.\n\n-- A narrowing of the search by Australian authorities. According to The New York Times, \"the initial search area that Australian officials announced Tuesday has been reduced by half, using new data analysis of the plane's likely fuel consumption, John Young, general manager for the agency's emergency response division, said Wednesday. The new area of focus in the Australian-led part of the search covers 89,000 square nautical miles, roughly 1,200 nautical miles southwest of Perth, Mr. Young said.\"\n\nThe Times says that search zone is roughly the size of Italy.\n\n-- Word from Thai officials that on March 8, their military's radar detected an unidentified plane that may have been Flight 370. Malaysian officials had earlier said their military spotted a plane that might have been Flight 370 crossing the peninsula near the border with Thailand. So, as The Associated Press writes, \"Thailand's failure to quickly share that information may not substantially change what Malaysian officials now know, but it raises questions about the degree to which some countries are sharing their defense data.\"\n\n","138":"-- Malaysian investigators - with the help of the FBI - are trying to restore files deleted last month from the home flight simulator of the pilot aboard the missing Malaysia Airlines plane to see if they shed any light on the disappearance, officials said Wednesday.\n\nHishammuddin Hussein told a news conference that the pilot, Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah , is considered innocent until proven guilty of any wrongdoing, and that members of his family are cooperating in the investigation . Files containing records of simulations carried out on the program were deleted Feb. 3, Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu said.\n\nCBS News has confirmed the FBI has been provided electronic data to analyze from the flight simulator. It is expected the hard drive will be brought to an FBI lab in the United States. This FBI is lending technical expertise, not taking over the investigation.\n\n\n\nU.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said U.S. investigators are prepared to help any way they can.\n\n\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether investigators thought that deleting the files was unusual. They will want to check those files for any signs of unusual flight paths that could help explain where the missing plane went.\n\n\"That's tantalizing information because authorities are looking for any piece of data, any shard or thread or lead, to give them a sense as to whether there was any intent, premeditation, or plot to try to divert the plane for any part purpose,\" said CBS News national security analyst Juan Zarate.\n\nZarate also addressed a Malaysian newspaper report that the captain selected five runways on the simulator to practice.\n\n\"It's not unusual that he would be practicing on different kinds of runways,\" Zarate said. \"That said, authorities are going to have to look at that to see what those runways looks like, if they match with runways in the region and perhaps some smaller runways in the Indian Ocean that could give them some clues as to where to look.\"\n\nSources told CBS News that there's evidence Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 turned off its route when someone typed a course change into the cockpit navigation computer, which would require training in the Boeing 777 systems. But sources say checks of the pilots' email and computers turned up nothing to suggest a plot.\n\nMalaysia Airlines Flight 370 with 239 people aboard disappeared March 8 on a night flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanations, but have said the evidence so far suggests the flight was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled. They are unsure what happened next and why.\n\nInvestigators have identified two giant arcs of territory spanning the possible positions of the plane about 7 1\/2 hours after takeoff, based on its last faint signal to a satellite - an hourly \"handshake\" signal that continues even when communications are switched off. The arcs stretch up as far as Kazakhstan in central Asia and down deep into the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nPolice are considering the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board, and have asked for background checks from abroad on all foreign passengers.\n\nHishammuddin said such checks have been received for all the foreigners except those from Ukraine and Russia - which account for three passengers. \"So far, no information of significance on any passengers has been found,\" Hishammuddin said.\n\nThe 53-year-old pilot joined Malaysia Airlines in 1981 and had more than 18,000 hours of flight experience. People who knew Zaharie from his involvement in opposition political circles in Malaysia and other areas of his life have described him as sociable, humble, caring and dedicated to his job.\n\nThe crisis has exposed the lack of a failsafe way of tracking modern passenger planes on which data transmission systems and transponders - which make them visible to civilian radar - have been severed. At enormous cost, 26 countries are helping Malaysia look for the plane.\n\nRelatives of passengers on the missing airliner - two thirds of them from China - have grown increasingly frustrated over the lack of progress in the search. Planes sweeping across vast expanses of the Indian Ocean and satellites peering on Central Asia have turned up no new clues.\n\n\"It's really too much. I don't know why it is taking so long for so many people to find the plane. It's 12 days,\" Subaramaniam Gurusamy, 60, said in an interview from his home on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. His 34-year-old son, Pushpanathan Subramaniam, was on the flight heading to Beijing for a work trip.\n\n\"He's the one son I have,\" Subaramaniam said.\n\nCBS News' Seth Doane reports anger boiled over Wednesday morning as the Malaysian authorities prepared for their briefing.\n\nTwo Chinese relatives of passengers held up a banner saying \"Truth\" in Chinese and started shouting before security personnel escorted them out.\n\n\"I want you to help me to find my son!\" one of the two women said.\n\nHishamuddin announced that a delegation of Malaysian government officials, diplomats, air force and civil aviation officials will head to Beijing - where many of the passengers' relatives are gathered - to give briefings to the next of kin on the status of the search.\n\nA source with knowledge of the investigation tells CBS News correspondent Jeff Pegues that there is a small group of American investigators painstakingly working to refine the data gathered from the Malaysians. The NTSB has a small team of three in Kuala Lumpur while the FAA has two investigators there coordinating with the Malaysian investigators.\n\nAircraft from Australia, the U.S. and New Zealand on Wednesday scoured a search area stretching across 117,000 square miles of the Indian Ocean, about 1,600 miles southwest of Perth, on Australia's west coast. Merchant ships were also asked to look for any trace of the plane.\n\nCBS News national correspondent David Martin reports that a U.S. P-3 Orion surveillance aircraft continues to search in the Bay of Bengal. The P-8 Poseidon has been assigned a search sector 1,500 nautical miles west of Perth. That means about half of each mission will be consumed just getting there and back.\n\n\n\nThe NTSB has been instrumental in helping the Australians in the South Indian Sea, Pegues reports. Working with data, they are reviewing possible flight paths along the original south arc of the search corridor. Now investigators are looking at other ways to narrow down a possible flight path.\n\nNothing has been found, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said.\n\n\n\nChina has said it was reviewing radar data and deployed 21 satellites to search the northern corridor, although it is considered less likely that the plane could have taken that route without being detected by military radar systems of the countries in that region.\n\nThose searches so far have turned up no trace of the plane, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said.\n\nIndonesian Defense Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro said Indonesia military radar didn't pick up any signs of Flight 370 on the day the plane went missing. He said Malaysia had asked Indonesia to intensify the search in its assigned zone in the Indian Ocean west of Sumatra, but said his air force was strained in the task.\n\n\"We will do our utmost. We will do our best. But you do have to understand our limitations,\" Purnomo said.\n\nHishammuddin said both the southern and the northern sections of the search area were important, but that \"some priority was being given to that (southern) area.\" He didn't elaborate.\n\nMalaysian investigators say the plane departed 12:41 a.m. on March 8 and headed northeast toward Beijing over the Gulf of Thailand, but that it turned back after the final words were heard from the cockpit. Malaysian military radar data places the plane west of Malaysia in the Strait of Malacca at 2:14 a.m.\n\nThailand divulged new radar data Tuesday that appeared to corroborate Malaysian data showing the plane crossing back across Peninsular Malaysia.\n\nThe military in the Maldives, a remote Indian Ocean island nation, confirmed to Malaysia that reports of a sighting of the plane by villagers there were \"not true,\" the Malaysian defense minister said.\n\nGerman insurance company Allianz said Wednesday that it has made initial payments in connection with the missing plane. Spokesman Hugo Kidston declined to say how much had been paid, but said it was in line with contractual obligations when an aircraft is reported as missing.","139":"MH370 search zone shrunk as simulator data probed\n\nActing Transport Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein answers questions during a press conference on missing MH370 in Sepang March 18, 2014. \u2014 Picture by Choo Choy May KUALA LUMPUR, March 19 \u2014 The search for the missing Malaysian jet in the southern Indian Ocean was narrowed after new analysis of its fuel reserves, as authorities said they were trying to retrieve deleted data on a flight simulator belonging to the pilot.\n\nAn assessment by the US National Transportation Safety Board allowed the search to be focused on an area about the size of Italy, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said in an e-mailed statement.

four aircraft, Young said.\n\nNTSB analysis on the plane\u2019s fuel reserves and the distance it could have flown narrowed the search area to about 305,000 square kilometres.\n\nAfter a futile search in the Andaman Sea that produced 400 radar contacts and no sign of aircraft debris or other clues, the US Navy reassigned the P-8 Poseidon. It\u2019s the US\u2019s top maritime-search plane, capable of flying for eight to nine hours at altitudes of 5,000 feet. It also has the ability to dip to 1,000 feet to get a closer look.\n\nUS satellites\n\nThe search for the Malaysian jet, which lost contact with air traffic control less than an hour after leaving Kuala Lumpur at 12:41am on March 8 en route to Beijing, is the longest in modern passenger-airline history. The previous record was the 10-day search for a Boeing Co. 737-400 operated by Indonesia\u2019s PT Adam Skyconnection Airlines, which went missing off the coast of that country\u2019s Sulawesi island January 1, 2007.\n\nThe Boeing 777-200 plane operated by Malaysian Airline System Bhd. was carrying 49.1 metric tonnes of fuel when it took off, giving a total take-off weight of 223.5 tonnes, according to the Subang Jaya-based company.\n\nAustralia yesterday said it was searching an area in the southern Indian Ocean that\u2019s about 1 1\/2 times the size of California for the missing jet as Malaysia asked the US to use its satellites to help in the search.\n\nChina, Kazakhstan\n\nMalaysia, leading the multi-nation effort to find the aircraft, divided the search into a northern zone and a southern region, with a combined span of 2.25 million square nautical miles, Hishammuddin said in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.\n\nChina and Kazakhstan have agreed to lead the search areas closest to their countries in the northern zone. The US has the best ability to assist in the southern corridor, he said.\n\nMuch of the area Australia is scouring is within the Roaring Forties, a region between the 40th and 50th degrees of latitude south known for strong winds and wave conditions, according to charts provided by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority.\n\nInvestigators are combing through data after the plane was deliberately steered off its course and disappeared from radar.\n\nThe jet made its last satellite contact at 8:11am on March 8, according to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak.

Hishammuddin told reporters Saturday that he had been informed that a Chinese satellite had spotted a 74-foot-by-43-foot object in the ocean. Joshua Paul\/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nThe focus of a search that covers 2.24 million square miles of ocean turned to an empty expanse far off the Australian coast, based on a projection provided by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, which dispatched a team to Kuala Lumpur 48 hours after the plane\u2019s March 8 disappearance.\n\n\u201cThe sheer size of the search area poses a huge challenge,\u201d said John Young of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. He said it covered more than 372,000 square miles of the southern Indian Ocean and would take \u201cat least a few weeks to search the area thoroughly.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Obama, in his first comments on the disappearance of the plane, said the United States will continue to work in close cooperation with the Malaysian government. \u201cWe have put every resource that we have available at the disposal of the search process,\u201d he told the Dallas-Fort Worth television station KDFW on Wednesday.\n\nMalaysian investigators worked to recover data erased from a flight simulator that the plane\u2019s captain, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, used in his home. A U.S. law enforcement official said the FBI had been asked to provide technical help in examining the flight simulator.\n\nMalaysian authorities have emphasized that both Zaharie and the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid, should be considered innocent unless proven otherwise. Police visits to their homes have caused suspicion that one or both of them might have had a hand in the plane\u2019s disappearance.\n\nShortly after the simulator was taken by police from the family home, it was discovered that some material had been deleted.\n\nForensic experts want to recover that information to determine whether it has any relevance to the investigation. FBI specialists often can retrieve data from computers that has been damaged or erased.\n\nView Graphic New data has provided an arc of possible locations for Malaysian Flight MH370.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to find any indication that the flight simulator had been used to reproduce flight conditions or circumstances that are now the subject of potential theories,\u201d said Weysan Dunn, a retired senior FBI agent who has dealt with many sophisticated cyber-investigations.\n\nPeople familiar with flight simulators said it was common practice to erase data.\n\nThe disclosure about deleted data underscores the delicate job facing Malaysian authorities, who have selectively disclosed details of their investigation to a public hungry for any hint of guilt or innocence.\n\nFrustration over the trickle of information boiled over Wednesday when relatives of Chinese passengers on the missing plane burst into the news media auditorium in the Malaysian capital, wailing with grief and anger, and unfurled a banner demanding that the government \u201ctell the truth.\u201d\n\nInvestigators have not publicly suggested that either Zaharie or Fariq had a motive or mind-set to sabotage a plane with\n\n227 passengers and 12 crew members aboard. But they have said that Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 was almost surely diverted by somebody with aviation experience.\n\nScrutiny has fallen on Zaharie and Fariq amid reports that the plane\u2019s westward turn from Beijing, the intended destination, was programmed into the flight computer even while other communications systems remained working and before the co-\n\npilot\u2019s last radio contact with the ground.\n\nThe change in direction was entered into the system before the final burst of automatic data sent from the plane via satellite at 1:07 a.m. and several minutes before Fariq said \u201cgood night\u201d to Malaysian air-traffic control. Two minutes after that, the plane\u2019s transponder went dark and the airliner disappeared from civilian radar.\n\nThe sequence of events seemed to indicate that the westward turn was not a spur-of-the-moment decision, but some experts said that path could have been pre-\n\nprogrammed as an alternative in case of emergency.\n\nDetermining what happened in the plane\u2019s cockpit in the 40 minutes between its takeoff and disappearance is crucial for investigators as they try to narrow a continent-sized search field and ease the grief of despondent relatives.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Zaharie or Fariq, separately or together, cut off the plane\u2019s multiple communications systems and steered it away from Beijing. It\u2019s also possible that one or both were acting under duress. Officials in Malaysia also have not ruled out mechanical failure, although they say it\u2019s unlikely.\n\nThe hunt for the missing Boeing 777 now involves 26 countries looking across a vast section of the Indian Ocean and huge tracts of central and southeastern Asia. That search area is split into curving northern and southern corridors \u2014 the best guess where the plane might have ended up.\n\nInvestigators now believe that the missing plane most likely flew far into the southern corridor, over the remote waters of the Indian Ocean west of Australia, the Reuters news agency reported Wednesday, citing a source close to the investigation.\n\nThe view is based on the lack of any evidence from countries along the northern corridor that the plane crossed their airspace and the failure to find any trace of wreckage in searches in the northern part of the southern corridor.\n\nThe Navy sent a P-8 Poseidon aircraft that had been searching off India in the Bay of Bengal to aid in the effort west of Australia. The plane can stay aloft for up to nine hours and can drop and monitor buoys that listen for sounds beneath the ocean surface. Even if the plane crashed into the sea, its emergency beacon will send audible signals for about a month before the battery dies.\n\nThe protracted and painfully inconclusive investigation has taken its toll on the families of passengers on the missing Malaysia Airlines flight.\n\nChaos ensued in the Malaysian media center as the passengers\u2019 relatives were surrounded by dozens of television camera operators, photographers and correspondents jostling for position in a narrow space at the back of the hall. A Malaysian government official appealed in vain for the relatives to leave before they were finally bundled out the door by police in an unseemly melee.\n\nOne woman collapsed to the floor and had to be virtually carried out as she cried, \u201cWhere are they? Where are they?\u201d\n\nAfter the family members were removed, only their banner was left behind on the floor. A government spokesman ordered it to be rolled up, saying it was not \u201cappropriate.\u201d\n\nMore than 150 Chinese were listed among the passengers aboard the missing plane. Some relatives, angry almost from the outset with the scant information, have been flown to Malaysia to wait for news, while most have elected to stay behind in China.\n\nMany grieving families in Beijing are staying at the Lido Hotel, their lives spent watching television, talking to counselors and waiting for updates from Malaysian officials. Daily sessions with representatives from Malaysia Airlines often turn into shouting matches during which the airline officials explain again that they have no information.\n\nThe spirits of some relatives had perked up a bit last weekend when Malaysia seemed to raise the possibility of a hijacking, a scenario that would increase the odds of the passengers\u2019 survival.\n\n\u201cThat night, many finally got out for once and got a good night\u2019s sleep,\u201d said Lu Kaisheng, a volunteer from Shenzhen, who is part of group providing counseling for families at the hotel. \u201cBut since then, you can feel anger start to rise again.\u201d","143":"Chinese relatives of people missing on the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 have been manhandled and thrown out of the daily press conference in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nA scuffle erupted as two relatives of passengers approached journalists to ask for information on the search and staged a protest against Malaysian authorities.\n\n\"We protest against Malaysia for hiding the truth,\" said a family member.\n\n\"We can't stand it anymore\" one of the relatives shouted, according to Sky News.\n\nSky reported that the Chinese pair attempted to unfurl a banner and then were attacked by police.\n\nThey were knocked to the ground and forcibly removed from a hotel room where the press conference was due to take place.\n\nThe family members, visibly distressed, were then dragged away and locked inside a room.

The arcs stretch up as far as Kazakhstan in central Asia and down deep into the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nPolice are considering the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board, and have asked for background checks from foreign agencies on all foreign passengers.\n\nMr Hishammuddin said background checks have been received for all the foreigners except those from Ukraine and Russia \u2014 which account for three passengers. He said none of the checks has turned up anything suspicious.\n\nRelatives of passengers on the missing airliner have grown increasingly frustrated over the lack of progress in the search after 12 days. Planes sweeping across vast expanses of the Indian Ocean and satellites peering on Central Asia have turned up no new clues in the hunt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really too much. I don\u2019t know why it is taking so long for so many people to find the plane. It\u2019s 12 days,\u201d Mr Subaramaniam Gurusamy, 60, said in an interview from his home on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur.

AP","156":"Did Thailand track missing jet? CHRIS BRUMMITT AND THANYARAT DOKSONE\n\nFocus is intensifying on pilots as Chinese officials say none of their citizens could have been involved in foul play. Jennifer Davis reports.\n\nTen days after a Malaysian jetliner disappeared, Thailand's military says it saw radar blips that might have been from the missing plane but didn't report it \"because we did not pay attention to it\".\n\nSearch crews from 26 countries, including Thailand, were looking for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which vanished early March 8 with 239 people aboard, including two New Zealanders, en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Frustration was growing among relatives of those on the plane at the lack of progress in the search.\n\nAircraft and ships were today scouring two giant arcs of territory amounting to the size of Australia - half of it in the remote seas of the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nCommander William Marks, a spokesman for the US 7th Fleet, said finding the plane was like trying to locate a few people somewhere between New York and California.\n\nEarly in the search, Malaysian officials said they suspected the plane backtracked toward the Strait of Malacca, just west of Malaysia. But it took a week for them to confirm Malaysian military radar data suggesting that route.\n\nThai military officials said on Tuesday (local time) their own radar showed an unidentified plane, possibly flight MH370, flying toward the strait beginning minutes after the Malaysian jet's transponder signal was lost.\n\nAir force spokesman Air Vice Marshal Montol Suchookorn said the Thai military didn't know whether the plane it detected was flight 370.\n\nThailand's failure to quickly share possible information about the plane might not substantially change what Malaysian officials now know, but it raised questions about the degree to which some countries were sharing their defence data.\n\nFlight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur at 12.40am on March 8 and its transponder, which allowed air traffic controllers to identify and track it, ceased communicating at 1.20am.\n\nSuchookorn said that at 1.28am, Thai military radar \"was able to detect a signal, which was not a normal signal, of a plane flying in the direction opposite from the MH370 plane\", back toward Kuala Lumpur. The plane later turned right, toward Butterworth, a Malaysian city along the Strait of Malacca. The radar signal was infrequent and did not include data such as the flight number.\n\nWhen asked why it took so long to release the information, Suchookorn said: \"Because we did not pay any attention to it. The Royal Thai Air Force only looks after any threats against our country.\"\n\nHe said the plane never entered Thai airspace and that Malaysia's initial request for information in the early days of the search was not specific.\n\n\"When they asked again and there was new information and assumptions from (Malaysian) Prime Minister Najib Razak, we took a look at our information again,\" Suchookorn said.\n\n\"It didn't take long for us to figure out, although it did take some experts to find out about it.\"\n\nThe search area for the plane initially focused on the South China Sea. Pings that a satellite detected from the plane hours after its communications went down eventually led authorities to concentrate instead on two vast arcs - one into Central Asia and the other into the Indian Ocean.\n\nMalaysia said over the weekend the loss of communications and change in the aircraft's course were deliberate acts by a person on board.\n\nMalaysian police were considering the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board, but were yet to say what they had uncovered.\n\nInvestigators had pointed to a sequence of events in which two communications systems were disabled in succession - one of them before a voice from the cockpit gave an all-clear message to ground controllers - as evidence of a deliberate attempt to fly the plane off-course in a hard-to-detect way. On Monday, they backtracked on the timing of the first switch-off, saying it was possible that both were cut around the same time, leading to new speculation that some kind of sudden mechanical or electrical failure might explain the flight going off-course.\n\nMalaysia Airlines chief executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said some sort of problem aboard the plane was not out of the question, although he noted it still was intact enough to send a signal to a satellite several hours later.\n\nAs further confirmation that someone was still guiding the plane after it disappeared from civilian radar, airline pilots and aviation safety experts said an onboard computer called the flight management system would have to be deliberately programmed in order to follow the route taken by the plane as described by Malaysian authorities.\n\n\"If you are going to fly the airplane to a waypoint that is not a straight ... route to Beijing, and you were going to command the flight management computer and the autopilot system, you really have to know how to fly the airplane,\" said John Gadzinski, a US Boeing 737 captain.\n\n\"If you were a basic flight student and I put you in an airborne 777 and gave you 20 minutes of coaching, I could have you turn the airplane left and right and the auto throttle and the autopilot would make the airplane do what you want,\" he said, \"but to programme a waypoint into the flight management computer, if that is what they flew over, is a little bit harder.\"\n\nInvestigators have asked security agencies in countries with passengers on board to carry out background checks.\n\nChina said background checks of the 154 Chinese citizens on board turned up no links to terrorism, apparently ruling out the possibility that Uighur Muslim militants who have been blamed for terror attacks within China might have been involved in the disappearance.\n\n\"So far there is nothing, no evidence to suggest that they intended to do harm to the plane,\" said Huang Huikang, China's ambassador to Malaysia.\n\nA Chinese civilian aviation official has said there was no sign of the plane entering the country's airspace on commercial radar.\n\nA group of relatives of Chinese passengers in Beijing said they decided to begin a hunger strike to express their anger over the handling of the investigation.\n\nOne relative displayed a sign reading: \"Hunger strike protest. Respect life. Return my relative. Don't want become victim of politics, Tell the truth.\"\n\nThe search for the aircraft is among the largest in aviation history.\n\nThe US Navy said P-3 and P-8 surveillance aircraft were methodically sweeping over swathes of ocean, known as \"mowing the grass,\" while using radar to detect any debris in the water and high-resolution cameras to snap images.\n\nAustralian and Indonesian planes and ships were searching waters to the south of Indonesia's Sumatra Island all the way down to the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.\n\nHuang said China had begun searching for the plane in its territory, but gave no details. When asked at a Foreign Ministry briefing in Beijing what this search involved, ministry spokesman Hong Lei said only that satellites and radar were being used.\n\nChina also was sending ships to the Indian Ocean, where they will search 300,000 square kilometres of sea.\n\nThe area being covered by the Australians was even bigger - 600,000 square kilometres - and will take weeks, said John Young, manager of Australian Maritime Safety Authority's emergency response division.\n\n\"This search will be difficult. The sheer size of the search area poses a huge challenge,\" Young said.\n\n\"A needle in a haystack remains a good analogy.\"\n\nCALL FROM BRITAIN\n\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron telephoned his Malaysian counterpart Tuesday (NZT Wednesday) to offer the UK's help in the first direct contact between the two since the flight disappeared, according to Downing Street.\n\nCameron did not offer specifics on what particular military or civilian assistance could be provided, the prime minister's spokesman, Jean-Christophe Gray, said.\n\n\"It was very much inviting any specific requests from the Malaysians,\" Gray said.\n\n\"Prime Minister Najib said he would think about that and let us know if they have any specific requests.\"\n\n- AP","157":"You are using an older browser version.

Forensic work is under way to try to recover it, he said.\n\n\u2014 Malaysian authorities have received background information from all countries with passengers on board the plane except Russia and Ukraine. So far, no information of significance has been found about any passengers, Hishammuddin said.\n\n\u2014 Malaysia has received some radar data from other countries, he said, but \u201cwe are not at liberty to release information from other countries.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Reports that the plane was sighted by people in the Maldives are \u201cnot true,\u201d Hishammuddin said, citing the Chief of the Malaysian Defense Force who contacted his counterpart in the Maldives.\n\nTicking clock\n\nThe latest news conference took place as the clock ticked on search efforts.\n\nThe box containing the flight-data and cockpit-voice recorders of the missing plane has batteries designed to keep it sending out pings for 30 days. That leaves 18 days until the batteries are expected to run out.\n\nInvestigators hope the recorders may reveal vital information about why the passenger jet carrying 239 people veered dramatically off course and disappeared from radar screens. But they have to find them first.\n\n\u201cThe odds of finding the pinger are very slim,\u201d said Rob McCallum, an ocean search specialist. \u201cEven when you know roughly where the target is, it can be very tricky to find the pinger. They have a very limited range.\u201d\n\nTechnology put to use\n\nSome of the nations involved in the hunt are deploying an impressive array of technology, including satellites and high-tech submarine-hunting planes, as they try to narrow the search area.\n\nThey\u2019re also trawling through existing radar and satellite data for clues.\n\nAustralia said Wednesday that the area of the southern Indian Ocean where it is searching for the plane has been \u201csignificantly refined.\u201d\n\nThe new area is based on work done by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board on \u201cthe fuel reserves of the aircraft and how far it could have flown,\u201d said John Young of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority.\n\nBut Australian ships and aircraft have so far seen nothing connected to the missing plane, Australian authorities said.\n\nSmall details emerge\n\nMuch of what has emerged in recent days has filled in a few more details about the early part of the missing Boeing 777-200\u2019s flight.\n\nBut clear information on what went on in the cockpit and where exactly the errant jet went after it vanished from Malaysian military radar remains frustratingly elusive.\n\nOn Tuesday, for example, a law enforcement official told CNN that the aircraft\u2019s first major change of course was almost certainly programmed by somebody in the cockpit. The change was entered into the plane\u2019s system at least 12 minutes before a person in the cockpit, believed to be the co-pilot, signed off to air traffic controllers.\n\nBut that disclosure only left more questions about the reason behind the reprogrammed flight path.\n\nSome experts said the change in direction could have been part of an alternate flight plan programmed in advance in case of emergency; others suggested it could show something more nefarious was afoot.\n\nAnd Hishammuddin said Wednesday that \u201cthere is no additional waypoint on MH370\u2019s documented flight plan, which depicts normal routing all the way to Beijing.\u201d\n\nThe Thai military, meanwhile, said it had spotted the plane turning west toward the Strait of Malacca early on March 8. That supports the analysis of Malaysian military radar that has the plane flying out over the Strait of Malacca and into the Indian Ocean.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t make it any clearer where the plane went next. Authorities say information from satellites suggests the plane kept flying for about six hours after it was last detected by Malaysian military radar.\n\nWho was at the controls?\n\nMalaysian authorities, who are coordinating the search, say the available evidence suggests the missing plane flew off course in a deliberate act by someone who knew what they were doing.\n\nFiguring out who that might be has so far left investigators stumped.\n\nParticular attention has focused on the pilot and first officer on Flight 370, but authorities are yet to come up with any evidence explaining why either of them would have taken the jetliner off course.\n\nAnd some experts have warned against hastily jumping to conclusions about the role of the pilots.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked on many cases were the pilots were suspect, and it turned out to be a mechanical and horrible problem,\u201d said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. \u201cAnd I have a saying myself: Sometimes an erratic flight path is heroism, not terrorism\n\nChina says it has found nothing suspicious during background checks on its citizens on the flight \u2014 a large majority of the plane\u2019s passengers.\n\nSearchers face deep ocean\n\nHishammuddin, the country\u2019s public face of the search efforts, has repeatedly said at news conferences that little is likely to be established about the mysterious flight until the plane is found.\n\nBut in the Indian Ocean, where Australia and Indonesia have taken the lead in the hunt, some of the depths searchers are dealing with are significant.\n\nThe Bay of Bengal, for example, which lies between Myanmar and India, has depths of between about 4,000 and 7,000 meters (13,000 feet and 23,000 feet), according to McCallum.\n\nWreckage and bodies of passengers from Air France Flight 447, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009, were found at depths of around 12,000 feet by unmanned submarines.\n\nIt took four searches over the course of nearly two years to locate the bulk of the wreckage and the majority of the bodies of the 228 people on board Flight 447. It took even longer to establish the cause of the disaster.\n\nRight now, authorities don\u2019t even know for sure if the missing Malaysian plane crashed or landed \u2014 or where.\n\nCNN has talked to more than half a dozen U.S. military and intelligence officials who emphasize that while no one knows what happened to the plane, it is more logical to conclude it crashed into the Indian Ocean.\n\nCNN\u2019s Brian Todd, David Fitzpatrick, Kyung Lah, Mitra Mobasherat, Atika Shubert, Evan Perez, Mariano Castillo and Catherine E.

What happens if the plane is never found?\n\nAs per an Inquirer.net report, such an outcome, though considered unlikely by experts, will be most devastating for the families of those missing.\n\n\"In any kind of death, the most important matter for relatives and loved ones is knowing the context and circumstances,\" said Kevin Tso, the chief executive of New Zealand agency Victim Support, which has been counseling family and friends of the two New Zealand passengers aboard the flight. \"When there's very little information, it's very difficult.\"\n\nIt will also have a complex impact on the airline industry, which will struggle to learn lessons from the incident not knowing what really transpired.\n\nRic Gillespie, a former US aviation accident investigator who wrote a book about Earhart's still-unsolved 1937 disappearance over the Pacific Ocean, says, \"When something like this happens, that confounds us, we're offended by it, and we're scared by it.\n\n\"We had the illusion of control and it's just been shown to us that oh, folks, you know what? A really big airliner can just vanish. And nobody wants to hear that.\"\n\nAccording to Andrew Thomas, the editor-in-chief of the Journal of Transportation Security, the airline systems continue to use primitive outdated technology and are not as sophisticated as many people might think.\n\nHe says that airports and airplanes around the world use antiquated radar tracking technology, first developed in the 1950s, rather than modern GPS systems.\n\n\"There are lots of reasons why they haven't changed, but the major one is cost,\" he said. \"The next-generation technology would cost $70 to $80 billion in the US.\"\n\nWhile a GPS system might not have solved the mystery of Flight MH370, it would probably have given the search teams a better read on the plane's last known location, Thomas says.\n\nAnother major factor that will come into play for courts, if the plane is not found, is liability issues. With no wreckage, it would be difficult to determine whether the airline, manufacturers or other parties should bear the brunt of responsibility.\n\n\"The international aviation legal system does not anticipate the complete disappearance of an aircraft,\" said Brian Havel, a law professor and director of the International Aviation Law Institute at DePaul University in Chicago. \"We just don't have the tools for that at present.\"","165":"Malaysian authorities today said some files were found deleted from the flight simulator found at the house of the pilot aboard the missing jetliner and experts are trying to retrieve the data that could be crucial for solving the aviation mystery.\n\nAs the search for the plane entered the 12th day with no significant progress so far, Defence and Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters that some data from simulator was deleted on February 3 and investigators are trying to recover the missing files.\n\nHe also said that the 53-year-old pilot, Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, and all passengers remained innocent until proven guilty of any wrongdoing.\n\nMalaysian authorities had earlier dismantled the simulator and reassembled it to analyse its data, hoping to find something that could give insight into the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 on March 8 with 239 people, including five Indians, aboard.\n\nAccording to some reports, investigators found the runways with over 1,000 metres length of five airports, including three in India and Sri Lanka, one at the Male in Maldives and an airport owned by the US (Diego Garcia), loaded into the home-made flight simulator of Captain Zaharie.\n\nCaptain Zaharie and first officer of the missing plane, both Malaysian, have come under scrutiny in the search for clues to trace the Beijing-bound Boeing 777-200.\n\nThe house of Zaharie was searched after Prime Minister Najib Razak said the aircraft veered off course due to apparent deliberate action taken \"by somebody on plane\".\n\nHishammuddin said, \"We have received passenger background checks from all countries apart from Ukraine and Russia, both of which had nationals on board.

Two Chinese women who shouted at Malaysian authorities and unfurled a banner accusing officials of \"hiding the truth\" were removed from the room. In a heart-wrenching scene, one woman screamed in sorrow as she was dragged away.\n\n\"I want you to help me to find my son! I want to see my son!\" one of the two unidentified women said. \"We have been here for 10 days.\"\n\nFiles containing records of flight simulations were deleted Feb. 3 from the device found in the home of the Malaysia Airlines pilot, Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether investigators thought that deleting the files was unusual. The files might hold signs of unusual flight paths that could help explain where the missing plane went. Then again, the files could have been deleted simply to clear memory for other material.\n\nDefence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference that Zaharie is considered innocent until proven guilty. He said members of the pilot's family are co-operating in the investigation.\n\nZaharie was known to some within the online world of flight simulation enthusiasts.\n\nIn a post on one forum, the CEO of flight simulation software company PMDG wrote that Zaharie was a customer who \"had developed an online presence in which he dedicated many hours of his time to promoting the enjoyment of flying generally, and flight simulation specifically.\" The company CEO, Robert Randazzo, could not be reached directly for comment, but the publisher of the popular forum AVSIM Online, Tom Allensworth, confirmed that the post was from Randazzo.\n\nA U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation by name, said the FBI has been asked to analyze the deleted simulator files.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in Washington that the FBI was working with Malaysian authorities.\n\n\"At this point, I don't think we have any theories,\" Holder said.\n\nFlight 370 disappeared March 8 on a night flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanations, but have said the evidence so far suggests the flight was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled. They are unsure what happened next and why.\n\nInvestigators have identified two giant arcs of territory spanning the possible positions of the plane about 7 1\/2 hours after takeoff, based on its last faint signal to a satellite -- an hourly \"handshake\" signal that continues even when communications are switched off. The arcs stretch up as far as Kazakhstan in central Asia and down deep into the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nIn his first public comments on the mystery, President Barack Obama told a U.S. television station that finding out what happened to the missing Malaysia Airlines plane is a top U.S. priority.\n\n\"It's a big piece of planet that we're searching and sometimes these things take time,\" Obama said.\n\nPolice are considering the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board, and have asked for background checks from abroad on all foreign passengers.\n\nHishammuddin said such checks have been received for all the foreigners except those from Ukraine and Russia -- which account for three passengers. \"So far, no information of significance on any passengers has been found,\" he said.\n\nThe 53-year-old pilot joined Malaysia Airlines in 1981 and had more than 18,000 hours of flight experience. People who knew Zaharie from his involvement in opposition political circles in Malaysia and other areas of his life have described him as sociable, humble, caring and dedicated to his job.\n\nThe crisis has exposed the lack of a failsafe way of tracking modern passenger planes on which data transmission systems and transponders -- which make them visible to civilian radar -- have been severed. At enormous cost, 26 countries are helping Malaysia look for the plane.\n\nRelatives of passengers on the missing airliner -- two-thirds of them from China -- have grown increasingly angry over the lack of progress in the search. Planes sweeping vast expanses of the Indian Ocean and satellites peering on Central Asia have turned up no new clues.\n\nAt a hotel near the Kuala Lumpur airport, one of the Chinese women who was removed from the room displayed a banner that said, in part, \"We are against the Malaysian government for hiding the truth.\" She later expressed frustration with officials.\n\n\"We launch our demands every day but to no answer, and they tell me to come back the next day,\" she said. \"No answer, every day.\"\n\nThe father of passenger Pushpanathan Subramaniam said in an interview that the wait was \"really too much.\"\n\n\"I don't know why it is taking so long for so many people to find the plane. It's 12 days,\" said 60-year-old Subaramaniam Gurusamy from his home on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. His 34-year-old son, Pushpanathan, was on the flight to Beijing for a work trip.\n\n\"He's the one son I have,\" Subaramaniam said.\n\nHishammuddin said a delegation of Malaysian government officials, diplomats, air force and civil aviation officials will head to Beijing -- where many of the passengers' relatives are gathered -- to brief the next of kin on the status of the search.\n\nAircraft from Australia, the U.S. and New Zealand searched an area stretching across 305,000 square kilometres (117,000 square miles) of the Indian Ocean, about 2,600 kilometres (1,600 miles) southwest of Perth, on Australia's west coast. Merchant ships were also asked to look for any trace of the plane.\n\nChina has said it was reviewing radar data and deployed 21 satellites to search the northern corridor, although it is considered less likely that the plane could have taken that route without being detected by military radar systems of the countries in that region.\n\nIndonesian Defence Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro said Indonesia military radar didn't pick up any signs of Flight 370 on the day the plane went missing. He said Malaysia had asked Indonesia to intensify the search in its assigned zone in the Indian Ocean west of Sumatra, but said his air force was strained in the task.\n\n\"We will do our utmost. We will do our best. But you do have to understand our limitations,\" Purnomo said.\n\n------\n\nAssociated Press writers Eric Tucker in Washington, Rod McGuirk, Satish Cheney and Chris Brummitt in Kuala Lumpur, Niniek Karmini in Jakarta, Indonesia, and Kristen Gelineau in Sydney, Australia, contributed to this report.","167":"Relatives of passengers on missing flight MH370 have been forcibly removed from a news conference in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe man and a woman were trying to speak to journalists before the briefing by Malaysian officials started.\n\nSome relatives have criticised the authorities for not keeping them informed of efforts to find the Malaysia Airlines aircraft, which went missing on 8 March with 239 people on board.","168":"Page Not Found\n\nThe page you have asked for may no longer be available or may have moved.\n\nSearching below may help you locate the items you're looking for.","169":"The imam cupped his palms before his face and invited the congregation to pray. \u0093Oh Allah, return to us those who are lost.

While there have been interfaith prayers before, they have always been without a Muslim representative.\n\nMuslims have been at loggerheads with Christians and Hindus in recent years, and some sermons last month identified Christians and Jews as enemies of Islam.\n\nHard-line Muslims have called for the burning of Bibles and in January firebombs were thrown into a church compound. A few years ago, a group of Muslims stomped on the severed head of a cow outside a Hindu temple.

The Roman Catholic Church has challenged that assertion in an ongoing court case which many Muslims see as a threat to the dominance of Islam. Most indigenous tribes in Borneo are Christians and speak only the Malay language in which the word for God is Allah.\n\nThe case remains unresolved in court and religious tension continues to fester.\n\nBut differences have been set aside\u0097at least temporarily\u0097following the disappearance of the plane after it took off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing on March 8.

But chaos broke out, with reporters describing scuffles and \u201cheartbreaking\u201d scenes, as Malaysian officials ejected them before the press conference started. A line of police officers then blocked their return.\n\nThe scenes came as new radar data from Thailand gave Malaysian investigators more potential clues on the course of the missing Malaysian airliner.\n\nIt disappeared early on Saturday 8 March around an hour after its departure from Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing. Both flight communication systems were switched off, prompting the Malaysian Prime Minister to declare at the weekend that the plane had been deliberately diverted from its route.\n\nA huge international search involving 26 countries is now underway covering possible flight routes south into the Indian Ocean or north to central Asia over a vast area covering land and sea equivalent to the size of Australia.\n\nOpening today\u2019s news conference, Hishammuddin Hussein, Malaysia\u2019s defence and acting transport minister, confirmed that new radar data had been received, but said that he was unable to disclose the \u201cvery sensitive\u201d contents without clearance from the foreign government concerned.\n\nHe said investigations had also been carried out into the reported sighting of large aircraft flying low over the sea near the Maldives, but were \u201cnot true\u201d. Mr Hussein also announced that files had been deleted from the flight simulator kept in the home of pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah and that investigations were continuing into the possible involvement of all the flight crew and passengers. He added, however, that all were considered innocent until proved otherwise.\n\nMr Hussein added that the focus remained on the southern zone in the Indian Ocean, which remained far more \u201cchallenging\u201d to search, and admitted that he found it \u201cheart-wrenching\u201d that no trace had so far been found of the plane or the 239 people on board.\n\nThe disclosures came as aircraft from Australia, the US and New Zealand scoured a search area stretching across 117,000 square miles of the Indian Ocean, about 1,600 miles) southwest of Perth, on Australia\u2019s west coast. Merchant ships were also asked to look for any trace of the plane. But the Australian Maritime Agency said nothing had been found.\n\nInvestigators have also asked security agencies in countries with passengers on board to check their backgrounds, but no suspicious findings have been announced. China has said it found no links to terrorism among the 154 Chinese citizens on board, apparently ruling out possible involvement of Uighur Muslim militants who have been blamed for terror attacks within China.","171":"And it\u2019s in this darkness, this near absence of knowledge, that speculation has flourished. It now seems as if, on an hour-to-hour basis, dots are constantly being reconnected both in the news, and through the rumours and stories which the media seem to be feeding off in the darkest, most conspiratorial parts of the internet.\n\nSo while there may be very little in the way of knowledge about what happened, there\u2019s been no shortage of theories. At the more official end of the spectrum, it was suggested last week that it might have been a terrorist attack. The reason for this was initially the use of stolen passports by two Iranians. When it turned out that immigration using false documents is relatively common in the region rather than being suspiciously exceptional, the terrorist focus shifted. It was now concentrated on the pilots, one of whom was apparently a supporter of a Malaysian politician jailed for sodomy only hours before flight MH370 vanished. Quite why the pilot should have responded to the imprisonment of a politician by hijacking a plane, and doing God knows what with it, was never quite explained.\n\nAs the days have passed, and the vacuum has shown no signs of being filled in with something concrete, so the volume of speculation has expanded. US radio host Rush Limbaugh claimed the plane was shot down by \u2018some hostile country\u2019. Another popular story has it that flight MH370 has been \u2018cloaked\u2019 using a hi-tech military device. Even a paper as nominally respectable as the Wall Street Journal reports that US counterterrorism officials are investigating the possibility that someone, be it the pilot or another hijacker, has diverted the plane towards an unknown location \u2018with the intention of using [the plane] later for another purpose\u2019. Oh, and some have mooted the possibility of alien involvement, which, to be fair, is as fact-based as the rest of the speculation.\n\nIt seems that conspiracy theorising and plain old rampant speculation adores a vacuum. Earth imagery company DigitalGlobe clearly recognised a publicity opportunity and, having trained its satellites on the Gulf of Thailand, took pictures of 3,200 square kilometres of ocean, before employing a crowd-sourcing platform to enable thousands of users to try to find the plane themselves. Grunge residue and Kurt Cobain\u2019s one-time wife Courtney Love did just that, using circles and arrows to indicate the location of the submerged plane, much to the media\u2019s amusement. It\u2019s not clear whether the multinational search effort has thanked Love yet.\n\nOf course, there have also been plenty willing to have a pop at the preponderance of conspiracy theory. One commentator suggests that it reflects a failing within American society: \u2018It\u2019s a small jump from Fox News to [conspiratorial website] Infowars. Millions of Americans have made that jump. Well, now they have a new pool of human misery in which to go fishing. Enjoy.\u2019 Another prefers to attack the dumbing down of so-called democratised journalism, where every opinion is considered as valid as another, and all now come potentially for free: \u2018[It is an] ideal story for the current journalism era because it costs nothing. Nobody has to go anywhere. Nobody has to cover the wreckage and the recovery. Not only is the story pretty much all just theories \u2013 but theories are cheap.\u2019\n\nBut there is more to this strange phenomenon than either the snob\u2019s recourse of choice, American stupidity, or the cost-conscious world of modern journalism. And that is the unwillingness to accept that what has happened is most probably as tragic and mundane as an accident. Because accepting this means there is no one to blame, no hijacker, no politically disaffected pilot, no military conspiracy. There would just be the bald fact that a plane, through no one\u2019s fault, had crashed. The absent centre around which the theories and speculation circulate is the wreckage. And once it\u2019s found, which it surely will be, the all-too-compelling mystery will evaporate.\n\nBut instead of a willingness to confront the fact that sometimes things go wrong, there is an implacable determination to find someone to blame, some nefarious agent to be held to account, be it a terrorist or a suicidal pilot. A modern reckoning with the sheer contingency of the world has been usurped by a pre-modern belief in the existence of some animating spirit at work in the world. Bad things happen for a reason.\n\nSadly, this unswerving desire to fill in the gaps of what happened to flight MH370 with ever-more elaborate conspiracy theories is doing no one any favours. It distracts from the search operation, prompting wild-goose chases and premature announcements, and it pre-emptively undermines the authority of any official findings to come.\n\nAs hard as it might seem, we would all be better off stepping back and waiting to discover the truth, rather than actively creating it.\n\nTim Black is deputy editor of spiked.\n\nPicture: PA\n\nFor permission to republish spiked articles, please contact Viv Regan.","172":"Sorry but we can't find the page you're looking for.\n\nThe page may have been deleted or moved to a different URL.\n\nOr you might have entered the web address incorrectly or come to us from an incorrect link.\n\nPlease try the following:","173":"Malaysia's Defense Minister said on Wednesday that files had been recently deleted from a flight simulator belonging to the captain of the jetliner that has been missing for almost two weeks.\n\nDefense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters in a news conference that investigators examining the flight simulator belonging to Zaharie Ahmad Shah, the captain of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, discovered files had been recently deleted from the home flight-simulator system, the New York Times reports.

A massive search operation in the Indian Ocean and beyond has yet to find any trace of the plane.\n\nChinese Ambassador to Malaysia Huang Huikang said background checks on the Chinese nationals on the plane didn\u2019t uncover any evidence suggesting they might have been involved in a hijack or terror attack, according to the state news agency Xinhua.\n\nUighur groups have been involved in attacks inside China and some have a presence in the Afghan-Pakistan border area, where Al-Qaeda and other transnational jihadi groups are based.\n\nMalaysian police are investigating the plane\u2019s pilots and ground engineers and have asked intelligence agencies from countries with passengers on board to carry out background checks on them.\n\nMalaysian authorities say that someone on board the flight switched off two vital pieces of communication equipment, allowing the plane to fly almost undetected. Satellite data shows it might have ended up somewhere within a giant arc stretching from Central Asia to the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.\n\nHuang said China had begun searching for the plane on its territory, but gave no details. When asked at a Foreign Ministry briefing in Beijing on Tuesday what the search involved, Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said only that satellites and radar were being used.\n\nA Chinese civilian aviation official has previously said there was no sign of the plane entering the country\u2019s airspace on commercial radar. The government has not said whether this has been confirmed by military radar data.\n\nMalaysian police say they are investigating the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism and issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board, but have yet to give an update on what they have uncovered.\n\nMalaysian military radar last spotted the plane in the northern reaches of the Strait of Malacca at 2:14 am on March 8, just over one-and-a-half hours after it took off from Kuala Lumpur. A signal to a satellite from the plane at 8:11 am, suggested that, by then, the plane was somewhere in a broad arc spanning from Kazakhstan to the Indian Ocean, west of Australia.\n\nInvestigators are scouring what little data they have to try and determine who was in control of the plane when it stopped communicating. They have indicated that whoever it was must have had aviation experience and knowledge of commercial flight paths.\n\nOn Monday, Malaysian Airlines chief executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said an initial investigation indicated that the last words ground controllers heard from the plane\u2014\u201cAll right, good night\u201d\u2014were spoken by the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid.\n\nOn Sunday, the Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein had said these words were spoken before the jetliner\u2019s data communications systems\u2014the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS)\u2014had been switched off, suggesting the voice from the cockpit was knowingly deceiving ground controllers.\n\nBut Ahmad made a potentially significant change to that timeline. Speaking alongside Hishammuddin, he said that although the final data transmission from ACARS, which gives plane performance and maintenance information, came before the co-pilot\u2019s words, it was still unclear at what point the system was switched off.\n\nThe search for the plane is one of the largest in aviation history, and now involves 26 countries. It was initially focused on seas on either side of Peninsular Malaysia\u2014in the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca. It has since expanded to include the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal as well as 11 countries to the northwest that the plane could have, in theory, crossed, including China and India.\n\nUS, Australian and Indonesian planes and ships are searching waters to the south of Indonesia\u2019s Sumatra Island all the way down to the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.\n\nChina was also sending ships to the Indian Ocean, where they will search two blocks of sea covering a total of 186,000 square miles (300,000 square kilometers)\u2014three times the area already searched in the South China Sea.\n\nThe area being covered by the Australians is even bigger\u2014232,000 square miles (600,000 square kilometers)\u2014and will take weeks to search thoroughly, the manager of Australian Maritime Safety Authority\u2019s emergency response division John Young, said.\n\nHe added: \u201cThis search will be difficult.

Pro-government blogs are focusing on the pilot`s support for opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, hoping that suspicions against the former will discredit the latter, an Associated Press report said.\n\n5:35 pm: Search for missing plane narrowed down by Australia\n\nThe Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said Wednesday that the search operation for the Malaysian airliner that went missing March 8 is being conducted in a smaller area closer to the Western Australian coast, the IANS reported.\n\nThe development reportedly comes after the search operation conducted by Australia Tuesday found no result relevant to the missing passenger jet.\n\n5:15 pm: Relatives of jet`s passengers dragged away from news conference\n\nAngry Chinese relatives of passengers on a missing Malaysia Airlines plane burst into a media centre near Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday, unfurling a banner protesting Malaysia`s handling of the crisis until they were bundled out by security, the AFP reported.\n\nAmid chaotic scenes, the relatives were besieged by camera-wielding reporters awaiting the start of a daily press briefing by Malaysian officials on the search for the missing aircraft.\n\nShouting and crying, they unfurled a banner that accused the Malaysian authorities of withholding information and not doing enough to find the plane.\n\n4:05 pm: Missing aircraft`s pieces found floating on Andhra coast?\n\nPieces of what is suspected to be an aircraft were seen washed up on Andhra coast Wednesday, a Telugu television channel reported, as per IANS news

the General Headquarters.\n\n2:00 pm: Plane did not enter our territory, says China\n\nChina has not yet found any sign a missing Malaysian Airlines jet entered in its territory, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said on Wednesday, Reuters reported.\n\n1:00 pm: Missing Malaysian jet in southern Indian Ocean?\n\nInvestigators are suspecting that the missing Malaysian jet may have flown into southern Indian Ocean, Reuters reported.\n\n\"The working assumption is that it went south, and furthermore that it went to the southern end of that corridor,\" the Reuters quoted the source who was referring to a search area stretching from west of Indonesia to the Indian Ocean west of Australia.\n\n12:20 pm: No trace of missing plane in southern Indian Ocean\n\nAustralian and American planes drew a blank Wednesday on the first full day of a search across a vast tract of the southern Indian Ocean for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, the AFP reported.\n\nAuthorities in Kuala Lumpur on Monday asked Canberra to take responsibility for the \"southern vector\" of the operation to locate the Boeing 777, the report stated.\n\n11:00 am: China deploys ships to search new areas\n\nSoon after Thai authorities claimed to have detected an `unknown aircraft` suspected to be the missing Malaysia Airlines plane on radar, China has launched its ships in the water to search for the

I know you know we can do nothing but vent our anger and cry, we can do nothing to you. Aside from lying, deceiving, you have been playing the gangster,\" she said.Two-thirds of the plane's 227 passengers were Chinese. Many of their families have become increasingly angry about what they feel is contradictory or confusing information released by Malaysia. Some have even threatened a hunger strike.Malaysian security forces forcibly removed the wailing Chinese relatives from the room and blocked the entrance, as scores of international and local media recorded the incident.Once the news conference began, Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said authorities were \"trying our very best\" to locate the plane and to narrow the search area, which now covers more than seven million square kilometers.The minister, who is leading the multinational operation, said he understands emotions are high. He said Malaysia was sending another high-level delegation to Beijing to explain more details of the search.Hishammuddin disclosed that some data was deleted from the flight simulator found in the home of the plane's pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, and that forensic experts were trying to restore it. He stressed that no evidence has been found that implicates Zaharie in any wrongdoing.U.S. law enforcement officials say investigators searching the flight simulator and e-mails of the pilots of the airliner have failed to find evidence that either Zaharie or copilot Fariq Abdul Hamid purposely steered the flight away from its destination.One of the U.S. officials said authorities were trying to learn whether Zaharie might have been training on the simulator on how to disable transponders and other in-flight devices ahead of takeoff from Kuala Lumpur. Investigators were also seeking to learn whether he had practiced flight patterns taking the plane away from its destination.The two U.S. law enforcement officials spoke Tuesday after being briefed by Malaysian authorities. They were quoted in the Los Angeles Times.Scott Hamilton of the U.S.-based aviation consulting firm Leeham & Company told VOA the Malaysian government appeard to be \"completely over their heads\" with the investigation.\"They've probably never had anything even remotely like this to deal with. [They] didn't know what to do with it, didn't know how to deal with the pressure from the Chinese government, which of course was very immense given the number of Chinese on the airplane. You had one agency of the government saying one thing, you've had another agency saying something contradictory. I just think they've been totally over their heads on this,\" he said.Political science professor James Chin with Australia's Monash University agreed that the situation was unprecedented for Malaysian authorities.\"Part of the reason is that the Malaysians don't have any experience with this sort of issue, and also secondly because the Malaysians are very cautious about giving information. Almost information they have they always want to double check it. And unfortunately living in today's age where social media is present at all times, this sort of time luxury does not exist for Malaysian authorities,\" he said.The airliner, bound for Beijing with 239 people aboard, vanished over Southeast Asia March 8, triggering the largest missing airplane search in aviation history. Investigators believe it was deliberately diverted, either south toward the Indian Ocean or north toward Central Asia.Hishammuddin said he could rule out reports that the plane was spotted in the Maldives, an island nation in the Indian Ocean. Eyewitnesses have reported seeing a low-flying aircraft around the time the plane went missing.He also said background checks on all but three of the plane's passengers have yielded \"no information of significance.\" Authorities are still waiting for background reports on two Ukrainian passengers and one Russian aboard the flight.Authorities have so far refused to rule out any possibility, including terrorism, hijacking, a mechanical malfunction or pilot suicide.","186":"Sorry, the page you requested on wptv.com was not found.\n\nPlease check the URL for mistakes.

Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanations, but have said the evidence so far suggests the flight was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca. They are unsure what happened next.\n\nInvestigators have identified two giant arcs of territory spanning the possible positions of the plane about 7\u00bd hours after takeoff, based on its last faint signal to a satellite. The arcs stretch up as far as Kazakhstan in central Asia and down deep into the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nPolice are considering the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board, and have asked for background checks from foreign agencies on all foreign passengers.\n\nHishammuddin said background checks have been received for all the foreigners except those from Ukraine and Russia \u2014 which account for three passengers. He said none of the checks has turned up anything suspicious.\n\nRelatives of passengers on the missing airliner have grown increasingly frustrated over the lack of progress in the search after 12 days.

The revelation that two passengers boarded the flight with stolen passports sparked terrorism fears, before authorities concluded that the Iranian men were just trying to get to Europe.\n\nWith few known facts and an increasingly bizarre set of circumstances, many have turned to conspiracy theories, some of them as far-fetched as alien abduction.\n\nHere are five theories about the missing Boeing 777 that gained traction, but haven\u2019t convinced the experts:\n\n1. The (possibly hijacked) plane landed on a remote air strip\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very unlikely, extremely unlikely,\u201d said Patrick Smith, an airline pilot and author in Massachusetts, U.S., who has been debunking flight MH370 conjecture on his website.\n\n\u201cEven the most remote airstrips aren\u2019t that remote,\u201d Smith told CTVNews.ca. \u201cYou can\u2019t just sneak in a Boeing, a wide-body jet, and nobody notices.\u201d\n\nEven if the plane managed to somehow land somewhere undetected, \u201cwhat exactly is the point?\u201d Smith asked.\n\n2. The plane was stolen\n\nIt\u2019s an outlandish idea, but that hasn\u2019t stopped speculation that the Boeing 777 may have been stolen, either for parts or to be used later in a terrorist attack.\n\nSmith said neither possibility makes any sense.\n\n\u201cThere are thousands of business jets and cargo planes that move around the world really anonymously every day,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy not use one them instead of stealing a passenger plane from one of the most prominent airlines in the world and drawing the entire world\u2019s attention to what you're doing?\u201d\n\nAs soon as talk of a possible theft emerged, other experts quickly pointed out that it would be virtually impossible to steal a commercial jetliner and sell off its parts, which are all marked with serial numbers and tracked by their manufacturers.\n\n3. Flight MH370 \u201chid\u201d below another plane\n\nA self-described \u201chobby pilot and aviation enthusiast\u201d attracted some attention by theorizing on Tumblr that the Malaysia Airlines plane, with its communication system turned off, may have flown \u201cin the shadow\u201d of a Singapore Airlines jet to avoid military radar detection as it passed over India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cIt would be extremely difficult to do that,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThe theory doesn\u2019t explain how the Malaysian jet could have broken off from the other flight to land undetected, he said. It would have also been \u201cvery difficult\u201d for the plane to keep pace behind another jetliner and not get picked up by its radar altimeter, which measures a plane\u2019s exact distance to objects below it.\n\nThe other plane \u201cwould have been suspicious right from the start,\u201d Smith said.\n\n4. The passengers\u2019 phones are ringing\n\nDistraught family members calling their loved ones\u2019 cellphones over and over again reported something odd last week \u2013 the phones were ringing. That led to speculation that the plane must have landed, allowing cellphone towers in the area to transmit the calls.\n\nBut those who work in telecommunications and the wireless industry immediately dismissed the idea, saying the ringing often means that the network is simply trying to locate the phone.\n\nAnd for everyone asking why none of the passengers made any calls if the plane was in distress, Smith said the answer is obvious: cellphones will only work if a plane is flying very close to the ground. While some jets have the technology to make cellphone calls possible at high altitudes, it\u2019s unclear if that was the case aboard the Malaysia Airlines flight, he said.\n\n5. The plane flew too high and disintegrated in the orbit\n\n\u201cI always save that one for last, it\u2019s so ridiculous,\u201d Smith said. He wrote on his website that he normally wouldn\u2019t bother with \u201csuch nonsense,\u201d but at least five readers have asked him about it.\n\nAll commercial airlines have a maximum cruising altitude and engine power will start weakening above a certain height, Smith said.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible for a passenger plane to fly out of the Earth\u2019s orbit.","197":"Kuala Lumpur, March 19: Malaysian transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein on Wednesday briefed reporters about the search operation of MH370, the missing Malaysia Airlines flight.\n\nHe said reports about sightings of the missing flight in Maldives were not right.

Two Chinese women who shouted at Malaysian authorities and unfurled a banner accusing officials of \"hiding the truth\" were removed from the room. In a heart-wrenching scene, one woman screamed in sorrow as she was dragged away.\n\n\"I want you to help me to find my son! I want to see my son!\" one of the two unidentified women said. \"We have been here for 10 days.\"\n\nFiles containing records of flight simulations were deleted Feb. 3 from the device found in the home of the Malaysia Airlines pilot, Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether investigators thought that deleting the files was unusual. The files might hold signs of unusual flight paths that could help explain where the missing plane went. Then again, the files could have been deleted simply to clear memory for other material.\n\nDefence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference that Zaharie is considered innocent until proven guilty. He said members of the pilot's family are co-operating in the investigation.\n\nZaharie was known to some within the online world of flight simulation enthusiasts.\n\nIn a post on one forum, the CEO of flight simulation software company PMDG wrote that Zaharie was a customer who \"had developed an online presence in which he dedicated many hours of his time to promoting the enjoyment of flying generally, and flight simulation specifically.\" The company CEO, Robert Randazzo, could not be reached directly for comment, but the publisher of the popular forum AVSIM Online, Tom Allensworth, confirmed that the post was from Randazzo.\n\nA U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation by name, said the FBI has been asked to analyze the deleted simulator files.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in Washington that the FBI was working with Malaysian authorities.\n\n\"At this point, I don't think we have any theories,\" Holder said.\n\nFlight 370 disappeared March 8 on a night flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanations, but have said the evidence so far suggests the flight was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled. They are unsure what happened next and why.\n\nInvestigators have identified two giant arcs of territory spanning the possible positions of the plane about 7 1\/2 hours after takeoff, based on its last faint signal to a satellite -- an hourly \"handshake\" signal that continues even when communications are switched off. The arcs stretch up as far as Kazakhstan in central Asia and down deep into the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nIn his first public comments on the mystery, President Barack Obama told a U.S. television station that finding out what happened to the missing Malaysia Airlines plane is a top U.S. priority.\n\n\"It's a big piece of planet that we're searching and sometimes these things take time,\" Obama said.\n\nPolice are considering the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board, and have asked for background checks from abroad on all foreign passengers.\n\nHishammuddin said such checks have been received for all the foreigners except those from Ukraine and Russia -- which account for three passengers. \"So far, no information of significance on any passengers has been found,\" he said.\n\nThe 53-year-old pilot joined Malaysia Airlines in 1981 and had more than 18,000 hours of flight experience. People who knew Zaharie from his involvement in opposition political circles in Malaysia and other areas of his life have described him as sociable, humble, caring and dedicated to his job.\n\nThe crisis has exposed the lack of a failsafe way of tracking modern passenger planes on which data transmission systems and transponders -- which make them visible to civilian radar -- have been severed. At enormous cost, 26 countries are helping Malaysia look for the plane.\n\nRelatives of passengers on the missing airliner -- two-thirds of them from China -- have grown increasingly angry over the lack of progress in the search. Planes sweeping vast expanses of the Indian Ocean and satellites peering on Central Asia have turned up no new clues.\n\nAt a hotel near the Kuala Lumpur airport, one of the Chinese women who was removed from the room displayed a banner that said, in part, \"We are against the Malaysian government for hiding the truth.\" She later expressed frustration with officials.\n\n\"We launch our demands every day but to no answer, and they tell me to come back the next day,\" she said. \"No answer, every day.\"\n\nThe father of passenger Pushpanathan Subramaniam said in an interview that the wait was \"really too much.\"\n\n\"I don't know why it is taking so long for so many people to find the plane. It's 12 days,\" said 60-year-old Subaramaniam Gurusamy from his home on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. His 34-year-old son, Pushpanathan, was on the flight to Beijing for a work trip.\n\n\"He's the one son I have,\" Subaramaniam said.\n\nHishammuddin said a delegation of Malaysian government officials, diplomats, air force and civil aviation officials will head to Beijing -- where many of the passengers' relatives are gathered -- to brief the next of kin on the status of the search.\n\nAircraft from Australia, the U.S. and New Zealand searched an area stretching across 305,000 square kilometres (117,000 square miles) of the Indian Ocean, about 2,600 kilometres (1,600 miles) southwest of Perth, on Australia's west coast. Merchant ships were also asked to look for any trace of the plane.\n\nChina has said it was reviewing radar data and deployed 21 satellites to search the northern corridor, although it is considered less likely that the plane could have taken that route without being detected by military radar systems of the countries in that region.\n\nIndonesian Defence Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro said Indonesia military radar didn't pick up any signs of Flight 370 on the day the plane went missing. He said Malaysia had asked Indonesia to intensify the search in its assigned zone in the Indian Ocean west of Sumatra, but said his air force was strained in the task.\n\n\"We will do our utmost. We will do our best. But you do have to understand our limitations,\" Purnomo said.\n\n- Associated Press writers Eric Tucker in Washington, Rod McGuirk, Satish Cheney and Chris Brummitt in Kuala Lumpur, Niniek Karmini in Jakarta, Indonesia, and Kristen Gelineau in Sydney, Australia, contributed to this report.","201":"NOWCAST KCRA On Demand\n\nWatch on Demand Live Now Coming up Soon","202":"The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation joined Malaysia\u2019s inquiry into the missing jet as authorities sought to retrieve deleted data on a computer flight simulator belonging to the plane\u2019s pilot.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s involvement, which was disclosed today by the White House, widens the U.S. role in probing Flight 370\u2019s disappearance on March 8.

The search zone is about 305,000 square kilometers (118,000 square miles).\n\nA Royal Australian Air Force AP-3C Orion aircraft, which made the first sortie to the area yesterday, covered about 65,000 square kilometers under good search conditions without seeing any signs of debris, Young said.\n\n\u201cWe still have grave fears for anyone that might have managed to escape the aircraft in the southern ocean,\u201d he said in a video posted on the agency\u2019s website. \u201cIt remains a big area.\u201d\n\nAnother Australian Orion was being added to the search today alongside an Orion variant operated by the New Zealand Air Force and a U.S. P-8 Poseidon surveillance plane, for a total of four aircraft, Young said.\n\nP-8 Flights\n\nThe U.S. P-8 will make one daily flight for three days followed by a maintenance day, according to the Navy.

Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. The search for the Malaysian jet, which lost contact with air traffic control less than an hour after leaving Kuala Lumpur at 12:41 a.m. on March 8 en route to Beijing, is the longest in modern passenger-airline history. The previous record was the 10-day search for a Boeing Co. 737-400 operated by Indonesia\u2019s PT Adam Skyconnection Airlines, which went missing off the coast of that country\u2019s Sulawesi island Jan. 1, 2007.\n\nThe Boeing 777 was carrying 49.1 metric tons (54.1 tons) of fuel when it departed Kuala Lumpur, for a total takeoff weight of 223.5 tons, according to Subang Jaya-based Malaysian Air.\n\nRoaring Forties\n\nMuch of the area Australia is scouring is within the Roaring Forties, a region between the 40th and 50th degrees of latitude south known for strong winds and wave conditions, according to charts provided by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. That may diminish the chances of debris still being afloat so long after the jet vanished.\n\nInvestigators are combing through data after the plane was deliberately steered off its course and disappeared from radar.\n\nThe jet made its last satellite contact at 8:11 a.m. on March 8, according to the prime minister. Malaysian officials, who have said they can\u2019t rule out hijacking or sabotage, are also exploring the possibility of a pilot suicide.\n\nThe plane\u2019s transponder beacon, which helps radar locate aircraft more precisely, and a text-to-ground messaging system were shut before Flight 370 turned off its course.\n\nSatellite pings that weren\u2019t turned off showed Flight 370 operated for almost seven hours after last making contact, Najib has said. That may have taken the plane more than 3,000 miles from where it was last tracked and pushed it to the limits of its fuel load, if it was airborne the whole period.\n\nMalaysia has received some radar data, according to Hishammuddin, the transport chief, without elaborating on whom it\u2019s from and how it could affect the search.\n\nMalaysia is assembling a team to send to Beijing to give briefings and updates to the families of the plane\u2019s passengers, he said. Of the 239 people aboard the flight, 154 were from mainland China.","203":"WASHINGTON \u2014 A review of emails and a search of a home flight simulator have found nothing to suggest the pilots on missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 purposely diverted it from its Beijing destination, according to two U.S. law enforcement officials.\n\n\"Nothing stuck out,\" said one of the sources, who was briefed on the search conducted by Malaysian officials.\n\nThe findings Tuesday appeared to undercut theories of a suicide, even as U.S. law enforcement officials continued to focus on hijack scenarios or other means of sabotage, including whether someone preprogrammed some of the aircraft's computer systems to execute the diversion.\n\n\"It's still possible that someone entered the cockpit and took the flight a different direction,\" said one U.S. source, speaking confidentially because the inquiry is ongoing. \"Or it was tinkered with beforehand.\"\n\nAn additional theory remains that one of the pilots \"took it upon himself\" to divert the plane for unknown reasons, the source said.\n\nThe crew could have been trying to divert the aircraft toward the Malaysian island of Langkawi, which has a 13,000-foot runway and an easy approach, one commercial pilot suggested in an Internet posting that stirred much discussion Tuesday.\n\nA team of investigators with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board has been dispatched to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's capital. That team is headed by John Lovell, a longtime NTSB investigator with experience in assisting foreign governments with crash investigations.\n\nChina's role in the search, now encompassing about 3 million square miles, also appeared to grow Tuesday. The official New China News Agency said two naval groups turned westward, toward the Andaman Islands, and waters southwest of Sumatra, an island in western Indonesia. They join two U.S. anti-submarine surveillance aircraft combing the south Indian Ocean.\n\nMalaysian authorities have been focusing on the crew since declaring Saturday that the Boeing 777's sharp and sudden diversion about 50 minutes into the March 8 flight from Kuala Lumpur resulted from a \"deliberate action by someone on the plane.\"\n\nThe U.S. source said his Malaysian counterparts were eager to determine whether the pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, might have been training for such a maneuver on his home simulator, specifically how to turn off the transponders and other in-flight devices. But, the source said, investigators \"didn't find that.\"\n\nHe said authorities had discovered nothing particularly disturbing in the pilots' personal lives. The copilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid, was preparing for his wedding, the source said.\n\nConversations between the cockpit and the air traffic control tower in Malaysia were friendly, routine and professional, with no hint of impending trouble, he said.\n\nU.S. officials believe the plane eventually crashed into water, the source said. \"As we get further into this, the percentages rest in the ocean. You have to believe the plane crashed into the ocean.\"\n\nPilots have been implicated in several high-profile airplane crashes in recent years, most famously EgyptAir Flight 990 in 1999 and SilkAir Flight 185 in 1997, but in both cases, government officials disputed U.S. investigative findings of pilot suicide.\n\nJames E. Rosenberg, a Woodland Hill-based forensic psychiatrist who investigated the SilkAir flight from Jakarta to Singapore, concluded that the Indonesian and Singaporean governments missed warning signs about the pilot's financial problems, impulsive behavior and anger over disciplinary actions.\n\n\"You got to understand that typical suicide does not apply here. Pilots are high-functioning, stress-resilient people You are not going to expect that these guys are crying, not shaving, not getting out of bed. You have to look at more subtle signs,'' said Rosenberg. \"What turned out to be important was not that he continued to look social and friendly and relaxed in casual contact ... but that privately he was angry and vindictive.''\n\nRosenberg said the pilot had also taken pains to disguise his culpability in the crash. \"In killing himself, he was potentially going to provide extensive insurance for his family. If he was able to make it look like an accident, he would avoid the humiliation to his family.\"\n\nAfter Sept. 11, airlines reinforced cockpit doors to deter hijackers, but little has been done to protect aircraft if the pilot is the malefactor. A pilot can turn off the plane's communications or turn off the cabin pressurization, something that could be done to incapacitate passengers.\n\n\"What pilots can do is almost limitless. The question is why they would want to do it. What is the motivation?\" said Jason Middleton, head of the aviation department at New South Wales University in Sydney, Australia. \"If you are going to commit suicide, you'd have to be a hardhearted person to take 238 others with you.''\n\nThe Malaysian newspaper Berita Harian reported Tuesday that investigators found software in the simulator for Male International Airport in Maldives, three airports in India and Sri Lanka, and one belonging to the U.S. military base on Diego Garcia.\n\nThe 53-year-old Zaharie has flown with Malaysia Airlines since 1981 and has three children. From his online presence, he appears to have been an extrovert who made do-it-yourself home-improvement videos to post on YouTube.\n\nHe was also distantly related to Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim and a strong backer of Anwar, jailed for sodomy in a long-running politically charged court case. Malaysian press reported that on March 7, hours before the ill-fated flight, Zaharie attended Anwar's latest court sentencing, leading to speculation that he might have done something to the plane as a political protest.\n\nPolitical analysts dismissed the suggestion, noting that Anwar enjoys broad support among Malaysia's pro-democracy intelligentsia.\n\nAnwar himself addressed the question Monday.\n\n\"I believe 90% of taxi drivers support me and are not happy with the [court] decision. But they did not hijack their taxi,\" Anwar told reporters.","204":"The request page could not be found!\n\nBack to nst.com.my","205":"Spain became the world's biggest wine producer in 2013, forcing its vintners to compete abroad in a tough market to sell off the surplus.

AFP PHOTO\/ MANAN VATSYAYANA (Photo credit should read MANAN VATSYAYANA\/AFP\/Getty Images) (Photo: MANAN VATSYAYANA AFP\/Getty Images)\n\nThe disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 sparks more questions than answers as 26 countries search for the plane more than a week and a half after its last signal faded away.\n\nThe mystery of what happened to the plane and the 239 people aboard deepens each day when partial explanations that emerge unravel.\n\nIf there was a catastrophe \u2013 a crash or a breakup in flight \u2013 where is the wreckage?\n\nIf somebody commandeered the flight, either the plane landed safely or there was a crash. But where, in a circle of possibilities more than twice the width of the United States, are the answers?\n\n\"First off, they've got to find the darn thing,\" said William Waldock, who teaches aviation safety at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Arizona.\n\nA look at the leading theories to what happened to Malaysian Airlines Flight 370:\n\nABRUPT DISAPPEARANCE\n\nThe mystery began about 40 minutes into a five-hour flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, about the time the drinks service might begin on a flight from New York to Los Angeles.\n\nThe Boeing 777-200ER took off at 12:41 a.m. on March 8. At 1:07 a.m., the plane's automated maintenance system stopped communicating with its airline. At 1:21 a.m., its transponder stopped signaling its location to air-traffic controllers and other planes.\n\nIn the final radio contact from the plane, a pilot said, \"All right, good night.\" Airline CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said the comment apparently came from co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid.\n\nThe timing of the comment has been disputed, and if it came after the equipment stopped transmitting, it could mean the pilot was involved in whatever happened. But Yahya said Monday that it came before the communications equipment stopped.\n\nThe abrupt disappearance initially suggested to ground controllers and aviation experts that the plane met a catastrophic end, either breaking up in flight or simply crashing into the Gulf of Thailand.\n\nAn electrical fire, or perhaps a fire from hazardous cargo, could have knocked out communications equipment. The disaster would have had to happen quickly enough to prevent crewmembers and passengers from calling for help.\n\nSwissair Flight 111 crashed into the water off Nova Scotia in 1999 after a fire forced pilots to try an emergency landing, according to Canada's Transportation Safety Board. The fire knocked out communications and the flight recorders five minutes before the plane hit the water, although the pilots were able to call for help before that.\n\nCanadian pilot Chris Goodfellow cited the Swissair case in proposing in wired.com that the Malaysia pilot could have noticed a fire, turned the plane toward an emergency runway and then lost control of the plane as it continued to fly.\n\nABC News reported that an oil-rig worker in the Gulf of Thailand said he saw the Malaysia plane \"burning at high altitude,\" but later said the report could be a hoax.\n\nIf the plane depressurized and killed its occupants, like golfer Payne Stewart's business jet in 1999, that would explain the silence from crew and passengers. But aviation experts say in that case, the plane should have kept flying automatically toward Beijing and should have been noticed along the path.\n\nIn two troubling earlier incidents \u2013 a SilkAir crash in 1997 and an EgyptAir crash in 1999 \u2013 investigators determined that pilots intentionally steered their planes into the water after persuading colleagues to leave the cockpit.\n\nBut those incidents happened relatively quickly after the planes took off. In the Malaysia flight, later clues suggested the plane flew more than seven hours.\n\nShips and planes from 10 countries searched the Gulf of Thailand for days in relation to the final radar contact but failed to find any signs of wreckage.\n\nINTENTIONAL SILENCE\n\nAs investigators studied the chronology, they suspected the different times that the equipment stopped sending messages meant somebody turned it off intentionally. This would require somebody familiar with the plane's equipment \u2013 the pilot or co-pilot, or perhaps somebody else on board.\n\nThe passenger manifest included two Iranian men \u2013 Pouria Nour Mohammad Mehrdad, 19, and Delavar Seyed Mohammadreza, 29 \u2013 who were traveling on stolen passports, which would have raised flags in the U.S.\n\nBut Interpol and Malaysian officials said the men were simply seeking to emigrate to Europe.\n\nThe FBI is also checking on the two pilots' background and their homes have been searched.\n\nCapt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah was a member of Malaysia's opposition party and he attended a hearing before the flight where an opposition leader was jailed.\n\nThe co-pilot, Hamid, was photographed allowing two teenagers in the cockpit with the crew during a December 2011 flight. Malaysia Airlines officials said they were \"shocked\" by the allegations.\n\nBut the FBI hasn't released any information suggesting either pilot was bent on intentionally crashing the plane or commandeering it.\n\nTHE TRAIL RESUMES\n\nAt 2:15 a.m., Malaysian military defense radar picked up traces of the plane hundreds of miles west \u2013 heading in the wrong direction \u2013 from its last signal. This revelation days after the plane disappeared led to confusion about whether the search should be focused in the Gulf of Thailand or west to the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe plane crossed the country's peninsula and headed into the Strait of Malacca in a zig-zag path along typical flight routes, in what Prime Minister Najib Razak said was \"consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane.\"\n\nThe plane's guidance system was programmed for the new route either before or during the flight, which would have required familiarity with the equipment, The New York Times reported Tuesday.\n\nThis radar tracking is what prompted the search to widen from east of the narrow peninsula to west, and up to the Bay of Bengal. But again, no wreckage was found by search planes or ships.\n\nGaps in radar coverage demonstrated throughout the ordeal raised the prospect the plane could have landed \u2013 or crashed \u2013 on the ground.\n\nLikewise, the plane's height could have prevented crewmembers or passengers from using cellphones to warn about the plane's diversion \u2013 if they'd noticed.\n\nBut ground searches could be difficult, too. Nearly 70 years after the end of World War II, searches continue for an estimated 100 British and American war planes hidden in remote jungles across Malaysia, Thailand and India.\n\nPOSSIBLE PIRACY\n\nAn aviation enthusiast, Keith Ledgerwood, posted a theory on tumblr.com that gained widespread attention that Flight 370 remained unnoticed as it flew across Malaysia by trailing a Singapore Airlines flight along the same route at nearly the same time. Both planes would travel under the same radar blip.\n\nA simpler explanation could be that the radar track mistakenly thought to be Flight 370 is really the Singapore flight.\n\nThis guesswork about a hidden Flight 370 is intriguing, though, because it would allow whoever was in control of the missing plane to follow the Singapore flight toward Spain before veering off over India or Afghanistan to land unnoticed somewhere.\n\nBut a cargo plane from a less developed country would have been easier to steal. For the Malaysia flight, this theory would again require a knowledgeable pilot to reprogram the plane, follow a sophisticated route, keep the rest of the crew and passengers silent and either land or crash somewhere.\n\n\"I seriously doubt it,\" said Patrick Smith, a commercial pilot who blogs at the site askthepilot.com. \"Remote as some airports are, none are small or unwatched enough to accept a Boeing 777 without it being obvious.\"\n\nFINAL TRACE\n\nDespite the lack of messages from the plane's maintenance system, it continued to search for a satellite with an electronic \"ping,\" in case it needed to send a potential message, as first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThis reinforced the notion that somebody intentionally turned off the equipment, rather than having it destroyed by in-flight fire or a crash.\n\nAt 8:11 a.m., the final ping sounded seven and a half hours after the plane took off.\n\nAn Inmarsat satellite orbiting 22 miles above the Indian Ocean was only able to detect how far away the signal was, not its precise location. That led to the current search in two major arcs stretching over multiple countries and thousands of miles of ocean.\n\nThe arcs themselves are imprecise because the plane conceivably could have kept flying an hour after the final ping before its fuel ran out.\n\nThe arc to the north is over land, stretching from Laos across China to Kazakhstan. Civilian or military radar might have picked up the plane along that route, but no sightings have been released publicly.\n\nThe arc to the south stretches from Indonesia across the Indian Ocean. This space is daunting because there is little radar coverage from Australia, which is helping search from the east, and the water is deep.\n\nGiven the length of flying time, the potential search area is now a circle 6,400 miles in diameter around where the plane took off.\n\nThe WNYC Data News team found 634 runways in 26 countries within that circle where a 777 could have landed.\n\nURGENT\n\nAfter so many days of uncertainty, relatives of the passengers are eager to learn their fate. \"The fact that there was no distress signal, no ransom notes, no parties claiming responsibility, there is always hope,\" Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin said at a news conference.\n\nIf the plane did come down over water, the search is urgent for possible survivors or wreckage. The amount of debris will depend on how the plane hit the water.\n\nWhen Air France Flight 447 crashed in the Atlantic Ocean, searchers found floating wreckage in five days and pulled material from the surface for 25 days. But even then it took nearly two years to find the plane's recording devices and rest of the wreck on the ocean floor to determine what went wrong.","219":"Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 with 239 people aboard went missing March 8.

He also said that the pilot, Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, is innocent until proven guilty of any wrongdoing.\n\nAdditionally, the Malaysia Airlines flight that vanished nearly two weeks ago was already 12 minutes into its diverted course when the plane's co-pilot calmly told air traffic controllers that things were \"all right,\" former FAA spokesman Scott Brenner said Tuesday on \"The Kelly File.\"\n\n\n\n\"One of the pilots clearly had the intention ... that he was going to take (the plane) in a different direction,\" Brenner told host Megyn Kelly. \"It's 100 percent clear this pilot, or this co-pilot, was going to take this plane with the intent of doing something bad.\"\n\n\n\nAt 1:19 p.m. on March 8, 12 minutes after the plane had changed course to the west, co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid gave a routine \"All right, good night\" in his final radio call.\n\n\n\nBrenner also believes it's likely that Hamid and pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah were both involved in the decision to change the flight's course.\n\n\n\n\"For a pilot or a co-pilot to punch in a new waypoint in their flight management system without the other one noticing would be hard to do,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe news comes one day after the New York Times reported that the route was programmed into a computer system onboard, meaning it was not executed manually by one of the pilots at the controls. Senior American officials told the newspaper that someone entered a code into a knee-high pedestal between the pilot and co-pilot.\n\n\n\nThe Times reported it is unclear if the change in course was reprogrammed before or after the plane took off, but the change was likely made by someone in the Boeing 777's cockpit with knowledge of airplane systems.\n\n\n\nAs the investigation into the flight widens, attention has increasingly focused on Hamid and Shah. Reports surfaced soon after the disappearance that Hamid had invited two women into a plane's cockpit for the duration of a December 2011 flight. And hours before the fateful March 8 flight, Shah reportedly had left the trial of Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who was sentenced to five years in prison for homosexuality. Authorities reportedly were considering the possibility that Shah, reportedly a supporter of Ibrahim, may have diverted the flight as part of a political statement.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the search for the missing jet continued Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe Chinese ambassador to Malaysia announced that China has launched a new search effort in its territory for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight amid growing uncertainty about when a key communications system was disabled on the Boeing 777.\n\n\n\nReports by Chinese media quoted the ambassador, Huang Huikang, as saying search operations were taking place inside China along the northern route investigators believe the plane may have traveled, The Wall Street Journal reported. Details on the search were not immediately available.\n\n\n\n\"Factors involved in the incident continue to multiply, the area of search-and-rescue continues to broaden, and the level of difficulty increases, but as long as there is one thread of hope, we will continue an all-out effort,\" China Premier Li Keqiang said.\n\n\n\nThe search for Flight 370, which vanished while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board, has now been expanded deep into the northern and southern hemispheres. Australian vessels scoured the southern Indian Ocean and China offered 21 of its satellites to help Malaysia in the unprecedented hunt, but no trace of the plane has been found.\n\n\n\nMalaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said that the search area in the northern and southern \"corridors\" totals 2.24 million square nautical miles (nearly 3 million square miles), about the size of Australia. Twenty-six countries are involved in the hunt.\n\n\n\n\"We know the United States has got possibly the best ability to assist us in locating the aircraft in the southern corridor,\" Hussein told reporters Tuesday, according to The Guardian. Hussein said he asked U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel for help in the search efforts.\n\n\n\nThe vast scope of the search was underlined when a U.S. destroyer that already has helped cover 15,000 square miles of water dropped out.\n\n\n\nThe Navy concluded that long-range aircraft were more efficient in looking for the plane or its debris than the USS Kidd and its helicopters, so effective Tuesday the ship was leaving the Indian Ocean search area, said Navy Cmdr. William Marks, spokesman for the 7th Fleet. Navy P-3 and P-8 surveillance aircraft remain available, and can cover 15,000 square miles in a nine-hour flight.\n\n\n\nMarks said finding the plane was like trying to locate a few people somewhere between New York and California.\n\n\n\nOver the weekend, Prime Minister Najib Razak said investigators determined that a satellite picked up a faint signal from the aircraft about 7 1\/2 hours after takeoff. The signal indicated the plane would have been somewhere on a vast arc stretching from Kazakhstan in Central Asia to the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean. The southern Indian Ocean is the world's third-deepest and one of the most remote stretches of water, with little radar coverage.\n\n\n\nIndonesia focused on Indian Ocean waters west of Sumatra, air force spokesman Rear Marshall Hadi Tjahjanto said. Australia agreed to Malaysia's request to take the lead in searching the southern Indian Ocean with four Orion maritime planes that would be joined by New Zealand and U.S. aircraft, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said.\n\n\n\nMalaysia's government also reportedly has asked countries to re-examine military and satellite radar data in the search for the missing plane, accusing officials of not being fully transparent in their findings.\n\n\n\n\"The only one out in the open is Malaysia,\" Hussein said Tuesday, according to The Guardian.\n\n\n\nThailand's military said Tuesday that its radar detected a plane that may have been Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 just minutes after the jetliner's communications went down, and that it didn't share the information with Malaysia earlier because it wasn't specifically asked for it.\n\n\n\nAir force spokesman Air Vice Marshal Montol Suchookorn said the Thai military doesn't know whether the plane it detected was Flight 370.\n\n\n\nMontol said that at 1:28 a.m., Thai military radar \"was able to detect a signal, which was not a normal signal, of a plane flying in the direction opposite from the MH370 plane,\" back toward Kuala Lumpur. The plane later turned right, toward Butterworth, a Malaysian city along the Malacca strait. The radar signal was infrequent and did not include any data such as the flight number.\n\n\n\nThailand's failure to quickly share possible information about the plane may not substantially change what Malaysian officials now know, but it raises questions about the degree to which some countries are sharing their defense data.\n\n\n\nWhen asked why it took so long to release the information, Montol said, \"Because we did not pay any attention to it. The Royal Thai Air Force only looks after any threats against our country.\" He said the plane never entered Thai airspace and that Malaysia's initial request for information in the early days of the search was not specific.\n\n\n\n\"When they asked again and there was new information and assumptions from (Malaysian) Prime Minister Najib Razak, we took a look at our information again,\" Montol said. \"It didn't take long for us to figure out, although it did take some experts to find out about it.\"\n\n\n\nHad the plane gone northwest to Central Asia, it would have crossed over countries with busy airspace. Some experts believe it more likely would have gone south, although Malaysian authorities are not ruling out the northern corridor and are eager for radar data that might confirm or rule out that route.\n\n\n\nThe northern corridor crosses through countries including China, India and Pakistan -- all of which have said they have no sign of the plane. Jonathan Gilliam, a former member of the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force, a retired Navy SEAL and a former federal air marshal, said on \"Fox & Friends\" Tuesday that the disappearance of the plane highlights issues with regulations in the airline industry.\n\n\n\n\"I think it already is verified or mandated that you're telling somebody that 'this is the course we are going' and 'this is the course to stay on,'\" he said. \"But I think there is less regulation once you get over areas where there is no radar, and that's a big issue.\"\n\n\n\nInvestigators say the jet flew off-course for hours. They haven't ruled out hijacking, sabotage, or pilot suicide, and are checking the backgrounds of the 227 passengers and 12 crew members -- as well as the ground crew -- for personal problems, psychological issues or links to terrorists.\n\n\n\nChina's state news agency reported Tuesday that background checks on all its nationals on board the missing Malaysian jetliner uncovered no links to terrorism. Xinhua said the Chinese ambassador to Malaysia made the announcement to media in Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\n\nThe finding dampens speculation that Uighur separatists in China's far western Xinjiang province might have been involved with plane's disappearance.\n\n\n\nMalaysian Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said an initial investigation indicated that the last words ground controllers heard from the plane -- \"All right, good night\" -- were spoken by the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid. A voice other than that of Fariq or the pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, it would have been clearest indication yet of something amiss in the cockpit before the flight went off-course.\n\n\n\nMalaysian officials had said those words came after one of the jetliner's data communications systems -- the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System -- had been switched off, suggesting the voice from the cockpit may have been trying to deceive ground controllers.\n\n\n\nHowever, Ahmad said that while the last data transmission from ACARS -- which gives plane performance and maintenance information -- came before that, it was still unclear at what point the system was switched off, making any implications of the timing murkier.\n\n\n\nThe new information opened the possibility that both ACARS and the plane's transponders, which make the plane visible to civilian air traffic controllers, were turned off at about the same time. It also suggests that the message delivered from the cockpit could have preceded any of the severed communications.\n\n\n\nTurning off a transponder is easy and, in rare instances, there may be good reason to do so in flight -- for example, if it were reporting incorrect data.\n\n\n\nThe area being covered by the Australians is even bigger -- 600,000 square kilometers (232,000 square miles) -- and will take weeks to search thoroughly, said John Young, manager of Australian Maritime Safety Authority's emergency response division.\n\n\n\n\"This search will be difficult. The sheer size of the search area poses a huge challenge,\" John Young, manager of Australian Maritime Safety Authority's emergency response division, said. \"A needle in a haystack remains a good analogy.\"\n\n\u00a9 2017 Cox Media Group.","221":"Kuala Lumpur -\n\nMalaysia's defence minister says files were recently deleted from the home flight simulator belonging to the pilot aboard the missing Malaysian jetliner.\n\nHishammuddin Hussein told a news conference on Wednesday that investigators are trying to retrieve the files.\n\nHe also said that the pilot, Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, is innocent until proven guilty of any wrongdoing.\n\nHishammuddin said background checks have been received from overseas agencies for all foreign passengers on the plane except for those from Ukraine and Russia -

Two-thirds of those on board were Chinese.\n\nTwenty-six countries are now involved in the hunt which covers a vast arc of land and sea, in a northern corridor over south and central Asia, and a southern corridor stretching deep into the southern Indian Ocean towards Australia.\n\nMaldives police probe reports of MH370 sighting\n\nNEW DELHI: Police in the Maldives are probing reports that islanders in the tourism paradise saw a \"low-flying jumbo jet\" on the day the missing Malaysia Airlines plane vanished.\n\nIn a statement released late Tuesday, police said they were investigating a report on the Haveeru news website that local residents had spotted a large plane flying over the remote southern island of Kuda Huvadhoo on March 8.\n\n\"The police are looking into the reports in the media saying that a low-flying airplane was sighted above Kuda Huvadhoo,\" the statement said.\n\nSeveral alleged sightings of the Boeing 777, which vanished en route from Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board, have proved to be false alarms and reports of debris at sea have also turned up nothing.\n\nHaveeru said witnesses on Kuda Huvadhoo had seen a white aircraft with red stripes flying towards the southern tip of the Maldives.\n\n\"I've never seen a jet flying so low over our island before. We've seen seaplanes, but I'm sure that this was not one of those. I could even make out the doors on the plane clearly,\" the website quoted one witness as saying.\n\nHaveeru journalist Farah Ahmed said several witnesses had given similar accounts.\n\n\"These people first heard a very loud noise from a plane flying unusually low and they came out to see it,\" Ahmed told AFP by phone from the Maldives capital Male, whose international airport daily handles dozens of wide-body jets bringing in thousands of tourists.\n\nThe hunt for the missing passenger jet now focuses on two vast search areas - a northern one spanning south and central Asia, and a southern corridor stretching deep into the southern Indian Ocean towards Australia.\n\nThe Maldives, located far from both arcs, is not among the 26 countries currently involved in the massive international search operation.","224":"Malaysian investigators have found that some data from a flight simulator taken from the home of the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370's pilot was deleted.\n\n\"Some data has been deleted from the simulator.

A yellow object thought to be from the plane turned out to be a piece of sea trash. Chinese satellite images showed possible plane debris, but nothing was found.

Zaharie Ahmad Shah, Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu said.\n\nIt was not clear whether investigators thought that deleting the files was unusual. They might hold hints of unusual flight paths that could help explain where the missing plane went, or the files could have been deleted simply to clear memory for other material.\n\nDefense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference Wednesday that Zaharie is considered innocent until proven guilty.

be Flight MH370 on March 8, just minutes after investigators believe it was deliberately diverted from its intended flight path by someone on board.\n\nAlthough the aircraft ID could not be 100 percent verified, the Thai data represents crucial corroborative evidence for the conclusions drawn from Malaysian radar tracking of MH370.\n\nBut it went unreported by the Thai military for nine days after the plane disappeared and only emerged following a check of radar logs on Monday.\n\nAccording to Air Marshal Monthon Suchookornat, the same plane was picked up again later swinging north and disappearing over the Andaman Sea.\n\nNothing was done before because the aircraft was not in Thai airspace \u201cand it was not a threat to Thailand,\u201d Monthon said.\n\nMalaysia has sought help from more than two dozen countries in the form of radar and satellite analysis, as well as surveillance vessels and aircraft.\n\nAcknowledging the \u201cdiplomatic, technical and logistical challenges\u201d inherent in running such a multi-national task force, Transport Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein said yesterday that Malaysia was ceding some operational control.\n\nHishammuddin said Australia and Indonesia had agreed to take the lead in the southern corridor across the Indian Ocean, with China and Kazakhstan doing the same in the northern corridor, stretching from northern Thailand into South and Central Asia.\n\nBut many of the countries involved are not used to such close cooperation \u2014 especially when it comes to sharing possibly

As I stated at yesterday\u2019s press conference, this is now a truly international effort.\n\nOur focus remains the search and rescue operation. We are working on narrowing the search corridor by:\n\ngathering satellite information\n\nanalysing radar data\n\nincreasing air and surface assets, and\n\nincreasing the number of technical experts.\n\nWe are also taking further steps to address the needs of the families at this difficult time.\n\nOperational update\n\nI will start by giving a brief operational update.\n\nAs we have said, the search for MH370 involves diplomatic, technical and logistical challenges.\n\nAccordingly, the main technical team organising the search and rescue operation has been broken into three groups: a diplomatic team, led by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; an assets deployment and logistics team led by the Armed Forces; and a technical group retaining overall operational control, which is led by the Department of Civil Aviation.\n\nOn the diplomatic front, all 26 countries involved in the search and rescue operation have verbally agreed to assist the operations, and Malaysia has written to all countries formally requesting co-operation. A number of assets which have already been committed are awaiting diplomatic clearance to begin operations. Once we receive formal clearance, we can then speed up the deployment of assets along the search corridors.\n\nAs I stated yesterday, although the search is still co-ordinated by Malaysia, our partners are increasingly taking the lead in their own territory and in agreed search sectors. We welcome this, and again would like to thank all our partners for their continued assistance and support.\n\nI can confirm that we have received some radar data, but we are not at liberty to release information from other countries. I appeal to all our partners to continue volunteering any and all information that could help with the investigation and the search for MH370.\n\nRegarding reports that the plane was sighted in the Maldives, I can confirm that the Malaysian Chief of the Defence Force has contacted his counterpart in the Maldives, who has confirmed that these reports are not true.\n\nWaypoints\n\nI am aware of speculation that additional waypoints were added to the aircraft\u2019s flight routing. I can confirm that the aircraft flew on normal routing up until the waypoint IGARI. There is no additional waypoint on MH370\u2019s documented flight plan, which depicts normal routing all the way to Beijing.\n\nPolice investigation\n\nOn the police investigation, as the Inspector General of the Police confirmed, the case has been classified under Section 130C of the Penal Code. All passengers, crew and ground staff handling the aircraft are being investigated.\n\nWe are sharing all information relevant to the case with all relevant international investigative agencies that require it. We have received passenger background checks from all countries apart from Ukraine and Russia, both of which had nationals on board. So far, no information of significance on any passengers has been found.\n\nLocal and international expertise has been recruited to examine the pilot\u2019s flight simulator. Some data had been deleted from the simulator and forensic work to retrieve this data is on-going.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to state that the passengers, the pilots and the crew remain innocent until proven otherwise. For the sake of their families, I ask that we refrain from any unnecessary speculation that might make an already difficult time even harder.\n\nHigh level team\n\nI would like to announce that in addition to the team that is already on the ground, Malaysia is currently assembling a high-level team that will immediately travel to Beijing. The team will give briefings and updates to the next of kin on the latest situation, and on search and rescue plans.\n\nThe team will include representatives from the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Royal Malaysian Air Force, the Department of Civil Aviation, and Malaysia Airlines.\n\nThe team will be led by Lieutenant General Dato\u2019 Sri Ackbal bin Haji Abdul Samad RMAF (Air Operation Commander, Royal Malaysia Air Force), assisted by Ahmad Nizar bin Zolfakar (Director, Air Traffic Services, Department of Civil Aviation) and will include a senior 777 pilot.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nWe will persevere. Our immediate focus is the search and rescue operation. We are pursuing every means possible to narrow the two search corridors.\n\n* Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein is the defence minister and acting transport minister.\n\n** This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of The Malay Mail Online.","238":"The item that you have requested was not found.\n\nPossible causes:\n\nThe address was entered incorrectly\n\nThe item no longer exists\n\nThere has been an error on the site\n\nIf you feel the address you entered is correct you can contact us, mentioning the error message received and the item you were trying to reach.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience.

Files containing records of simulations carried out on the program were deleted Feb. 3, Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu said. ( What if the missing Malaysia plane is never found?

( Searchers draw blank in southern search for Malaysia plane) Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 with 239 people aboard disappeared March 8 on a night flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanations, but have said the evidence so far suggests the flight was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled. They are unsure what happened next. ( Why do airplane transponders have an 'off switch?' Investigators have identified two giant arcs of territory spanning the possible positions of the plane about seven-and-a-half hours after takeoff, based on its last faint signal to a satellite - an hourly \"handshake\" signal that continues even when communications are switched off. The arcs stretch up as far as Kazakhstan in central Asia and down deep into the southern Indian Ocean. ( Malaysia discounts possible missing plane sighting in Maldives Police are considering the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board, and have asked for background checks from abroad on all foreign passengers.Hishammuddin said such checks have been received for all the foreigners except those from Ukraine and Russia - which account for three passengers - and that nothing suspicious has turned up.\"So far, no information of significance on any passengers has been found,\" Hishammuddin said.The 53-year-old pilot joined Malaysia Airlines in 1981 and had more than 18,000 hours of flight experience. People who knew Zaharie from his involvement in opposition political circles in Malaysia and other areas of his life have described him as sociable, humble, caring and dedicated to his job.The crisis has exposed the lack of a failsafe way of tracking modern passenger planes on which data transmission systems and transponders - which make them visible to civilian radar - have been severed. At enormous cost, 26 countries are helping Malaysia look for the plane.Relatives of passengers on the missing airliner - two thirds of them from China - have grown increasingly frustrated over the lack of progress in the search, in its 12th day on Wednesday. Planes sweeping across vast expanses of the Indian Ocean and satellites peering on Central Asia have turned up no new clues in the hunt.\"It's really too much. I don't know why it is taking so long for so many people to find the plane. It's 12 days,\" Subaramaniam Gurusamy, 60, said in an interview from his home on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. His 34-year-old son, Pushpanathan Subramaniam, was on the flight heading to Beijing for a work trip.\"He's the one son I have,\" Subaramaniam said.Before Wednesday's news briefing at a hotel near the Kuala Lumpur airport, two Chinese relatives of passengers held up a banner saying \"Truth\" in Chinese and started shouting before security personnel escorted them out.\"I want you to help me to find my son!\" one of the two women said.Aircraft from Australia, the U.S. and New Zealand on Wednesday scoured a search area stretching across 305,000 square kilometers (117,000 square miles) of the Indian Ocean, about 2,600 kilometers (1,600 miles) southwest of Perth, on Australia's west coast. Merchant ships were also asked to look for any trace of the plane.Nothing has been found, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said.China has said it was reviewing radar data and deployed 21 satellites to search the northern corridor of the search area stretching as far as Kazakhstan, although it is considered less likely that the plane could have taken that route without being detected by military radar systems of the countries in that region.Those searches so far have turned up no trace of the plane, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said Wednesday.Indonesian Defense Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro said Indonesia military radar didn't pick up any signs of Flight 370 on the day the plane went missing. He said Malaysia had asked Indonesia to intensify the search in its assigned zone in the Indian Ocean west of Sumatra, but said his air force was strained in the task.\"We will do our utmost. We will do our best. But you do have to understand our limitations,\" Purnomo said.Hishammuddin said both the southern and the northern sections of the search area were important, but that \"some priority was being given to that (southern) area.\" He didn't elaborate.Malaysian investigators say the plane departed 12:41 a.m. on March 8 and headed northeast toward Beijing over the Gulf of Thailand, but that it turned back after the final words were heard from the cockpit. Malaysian military radar data places the plane west of Malaysia in the Strait of Malacca at 2:14 a.m.Thailand divulged new radar data Tuesday that appeared to corroborate Malaysian data showing the plane crossing back across Peninsular Malaysia.The military in the Maldives, a remote Indian Ocean island nation, confirmed to Malaysia that reports of a sighting of the plane by villagers there were \"not true,\" the Malaysian defense minister said.German insurance company Allianz said Wednesday that it has made initial payments in connection with the missing plane. Spokesman Hugo Kidston declined to say how much had been paid, but said it was in line with contractual obligations when an aircraft is reported as missing.","241":"Kuala Lumpur - The ice-cold trail for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has spawned an expanding array of theories - from the sensible to the outlandish - as a fascinated public attempts to fill the information vacuum.\n\nDid distressed pilots veer toward a nearby airstrip? Was the plane hidden under another jet's radar \u201cshadow\u201d? Did it fly on for hours past the remote Maldives?\n\nSome of the hypotheses would strain the creativity of a Hollywood screenwriter, but in the absence of firm facts in one of aviation's greatest mysteries, few can be completely ruled out.\n\nOne new theory exploding across social media is that a cockpit fire or other emergency disabled MH370's communications and forced the pilots into a heroic attempt to land in a nearby Malaysian airfield.\n\nFormer airline pilots say this could explain why the plane was diverted - \u201cdeliberately\u201d, according to Malaysian authorities - westward toward the Indian Ocean and off its Kuala Lumpur-Beijing path with 239 people aboard early on March 8.\n\n\u201cIt is very possible that they were working their asses off, doing the very best they could to combat a very difficult problem and became overcome by perhaps a fire, perhaps smoke,\u201d Barry Schiff, a TWA pilot for 34 years, said on CNN.\n\nSuspicions have mounted that the cockpit crew or hijackers disabled the plane's communications systems to mask its location.\n\nA motive for that remains unknown, but everyone from media mogul Rupert Murdoch to alternative rocker Courtney Love and millions of social-media users worldwide have pushed their ideas.\n\nMurdoch piled on to wild early speculation that the plane may have been commandeered by unknown persons to Africa, Pakistan or even North Korea.\n\n\u201cWorld seems transfixed by 777 disappearance. Maybe no crash but stolen, effectively hidden, perhaps in Northern Pakistan, like Bin Laden,\u201d he said on his Twitter feed.\n\nSuch theories are widely debunked due to the unlikelihood that a jumbo jet could have crossed numerous international boundaries and radar spaces undetected.\n\nThe exponents of another theory, which evokes a Hollywood thriller, suggest that whoever diverted the jet closely followed a Singapore Airlines plane flying north past Malaysia in an attempt to hide under its radar \u201cshadow\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, social media in China - two-thirds of the plane's passengers were Chinese - have hypothesised that the plane was struck and vapourised by a meteorite.\n\nSeeking hard facts, the global crowd-sourcing community has engaged in intense debate over images circulated online that purportedly show possible aircraft debris at far-flung locations.\n\nSatellite firm DigitalGlobe said on Monday that three million people had used its platform in the desktop hunt for plane wreckage, with 257 million \u201cmap views\u201d by participants poring over grainy satellite images.\n\nCourtney Love, the flamboyant lead singer for alternative rock group Hole, weighed in on Monday, posting a photo of the sea's surface with arrows she added and the word \u201cPlane?\u201d\n\nMalaysian authorities have declined to comment on much of the speculation, and experts are reluctant to rule out all but the most outlandish notions, leaving much on the table and adding to the sense of a global response grasping at straws.\n\n\u201cThere are all these polarising theories with so little definitive information that is verified,\u201d said Paul Yap, an aviation lecturer at Temasek Polytechnic in Singapore.\n\n\u201cEverything that is not denied so far is being considered to be true, making a lot of theories quite plausible and that makes it even more difficult.\u201d\n\nPolice in the tiny island republic of the Maldives in the Indian Ocean said on Tuesday they are probing reports that residents saw a \u201clow-flying jumbo jet\u201d with markings similar to Malaysia Airlines on the morning the plane vanished.\n\n\u201cI could even make out the doors on the plane clearly,\u201d one unnamed eyewitness was quoted saying.\n\nBut the Maldives are far from the vast arc along which Malaysian authorities, based on satellite data, say the plane may have travelled. An earlier proliferation of reports of a jet in flames off eastern Malaysia proved false.\n\nThe apparent expert handling of the plane's course change has trained a harsh light on Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah and co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid.\n\nZaharie was a supporter of Malaysia's political opposition and Malaysian media have reported he is distantly related to the daughter-in-law of opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim.\n\nThis sparked speculation over whether Zaharie was planning to use the plane in a bizarre act of revenge over Anwar's conviction for sodomy in a politically charged case - a court ruling that came just hours before MH370 took off.\n\nBut nothing has emerged on either pilot to suggest extreme views.\n\nUntil the plane is found, conspiracy theories, speculation and mystery will reign, said David Kaminski-Morrow, air transport editor for industry magazine Flight International.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing conclusive... It is all very hazy so anything that is unexplored is still a possibility,\u201d he said. - AFP","242":"Investigators of missing Malaysia Airlines fight 370's disappearance are checking the backgrounds of the passenger jet's 227 passengers and 12 crew members, as well as the ground crew.

All 12 crew members are Malaysian.\n\nThe pilot: Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, joined Malaysia Airlines in 1981 and had more than 18,000 hours of flying experience. Known as an avid aviation enthusiast, Zaharie had set up an elaborate flight simulator in his home, which has been confiscated by Malaysian authorities.\n\nAccording to Malaysia Airlines, Zaharie is certified by Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation as a flight simulator examiner. Born in northern Penang state, the bald-headed captain and grandfather is also an enthusiastic handyman and proud home cook , known for bringing food he cooked himself to community events.\n\nA supporter of Malaysia's main opposition parties, he had volunteered to be a poll monitor in recent elections.\n\nThe co-pilot: Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, joined Malaysia Airlines in 2007 and with just 2,763 hours of flight experience, he had only recently started co-piloting the sophisticated Boeing 777. The son of a high-ranking civil servant in Selangor state, Fariq was described as a \"good boy, a good Muslim, humble and quiet\" by Ahmad Sarafi Ali Asrah, the head of his community mosque, in an interview with the Associated Press. He was filmed recently by a crew from \"CNN Business Traveler,\" landing a Boeing 777-200, the same model of the twin-aisle plane that went missing.\n\nFariq has drawn greatest scrutiny after the revelation he and another pilot invited two women boarding their aircraft to sit in the cockpit for a flight from Phuket, Thailand to Kuala Lumpur in 2011.\n\nCBS News\n\nAviation engineer on board: Malaysian police are investigating Mohd Khairul Amri Selamat, 29, a Malaysian flight engineer among the passengers, as they focus on anyone on board who had technical flying knowledge. According to reports, Khairul has indicated on social media that had worked for a private jet charter company. Reuters reports that Khairul had more than 10 years experience as a flight engineer, but that as an engineer specializing in executive jets, he would \"not necessarily have all the knowledge needed to divert and fly a large jetliner.\"\n\nSelamat Omar, Khairul's father, told AP that there is no reason to suspect him, adding: \"It is impossible for him to be involved in something like this.\"\n\nPassengers with stolen passports: Early speculation leaned toward terrorism after two men, later identified as Iranians, boarded the plane with stolen passports. Authorities later determined Pouria Nourmohammadi Mehrdad, 19, and Seyed Mohammed Reza Delavar, 29, were migrants seeking to travel to Europe illegally. The two men were not found to have links to terrorism.\n\nThe other passengers: The passengers included artists, business people, worshipers and vacationers. Five passengers were children under 5 years old, including a two-year-old, the youngest passenger. The oldest passenger was 76.\n\n\n\nCourtesy of Wood Family\n\nThere were three Americans , including Philip Wood , 50, a technical storage executive at IBM Malaysia who was planning to move from Beijing to Malaysia with his girlfriend, Sarah Bajc. \"The clothes in his closet are the worst,\" Bajc told CBS News' Seth Doane . \"I open the closet and it smells like him.\" The two other Americans have been identified as Nicole Meng, 4, and Yan Zhang, 2.

There was also a celebrated Uighur artist called Memetjan Abla.\n\nChina announced Tuesday that background checks of the 154 Chinese citizens on board turned up no links to terrorism, apparently ruling out the possibility that Uighur Muslim militants who have been blamed for terror attacks within China might have been involved in the disappearance.\n\n\n\nThere were 20 employees from a Texas-based company, F reescale Semiconductor , 12 of whom were from Malaysia, and eight of whom were from China.

The information emerged during checks of radar logs on Monday - nine days after the Malaysia Airlines jet carrying 239 passengers and crew disappeared - after a request from the Malaysian government, according to Air Marshal Monthon Suchookorn.\n\nAn \"unknown aircraft was detected at 00:28 (local time, 1:28 am Malaysian time), six minutes after MH370 vanished\" in the South China Sea, moving southwest towards Kuala Lumpur and the Strait of Malacca, he said.\n\nThat timing corresponds with the last transmission from the Boeing 777's transponder at 1:21 am Malaysian time, which relayed information about the plane's altitude and location.\n\nThe timing of the plane being spotted travelling in the opposite direction from MH370's intended flight path to Beijing also comes after the final voice communication from the jet, a seemingly relaxed \"All right, good night\" at 1:19 am.\n\nMalaysia Airlines believes it was the co-pilot speaking from the cockpit.\n\nMonthon said that although the signal was sporadic, the aircraft was later again picked up by Thai radar swinging north and disappearing over the Andaman Sea.\n\n\"It's not confirmed that the aircraft is MH370,\" he said, adding he was unable to give \"exact times\" of the later sightings.\n\nThe plane slipped off Malaysian civilian radar screens at 1:30 am but continued to blip on its military radars until 2:15 am before disappearing entirely.\n\nThe Thai revelations are likely to fuel anger at the apparently sluggish and at times contradictory official response to the jet's disappearance, which has left anguished relatives pleading for answers on the fate of their loved ones.\n\nThe Thai air force did not check its records because the aircraft was not in \"Thai airspace and it was not a threat to Thailand\", the spokesman said, denying it had been \"withholding information\".\n\nInitially the massive search for the vanished jet focused on the Gulf of Thailand and adjacent South China Sea, with several nations sending boats, helicopters and jets to scour the waters.\n\nThe investigation into the fate of the Boeing 777 has focused on findings it was likely deliberately diverted from its flight path to Beijing, probably by someone in the cockpit with advanced aviation skills.\n\nBut the drip-feed of often conflicting information from Malaysia has sparked fury among desperate relatives and condemnation from Chinese authorities. Two-thirds of those on board were Chinese.\n\nTwenty-six countries are now involved in the hunt which covers a vast arc of land and sea, in a northern corridor over south and central Asia, and a southern corridor stretching deep into the southern Indian Ocean towards Australia.\n\nRead also:\n\nAustralians to look for disappeared Malaysian plane in open sea\n\nThailand\u2019s officials give belated radar information week after plane loss\n\nMissing Malaysian Boeing did not cross Kyrgyz border - Kyrgyz ministry\n\nHijacking or terrorist seizure?

Twenty-six countries are looking for the aircraft as relatives anxiously await news.\n\n\"It's really too much. I don't know why it is taking so long for so many people to find the plane. It's 12 days,\" Subaramaniam Gurusamy, 60, said in an interview from his home on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. His 34-year-old son Pushpanathan Subramaniam was on the flight heading to Beijing for a work trip.\n\n\"He's the one son I have,\" Subaramaniam said.\n\nTwo Chinese relatives of passengers held up a banner and started shouting at a hotel near Kuala Lumpur's airport where officials were set to hold a briefing on the search. Police escorted them from the venue.\n\nInvestigators have identified two giant arcs of territory spanning the possible positions of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 about 7\u00bd hours after takeoff, based on its last faint signal to a satellite. Cmdr. William Marks, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet, said finding the plane was like trying to locate a few people somewhere between New York and California.\n\nAircraft from Australia, the U.S. and New Zealand on Wednesday scoured a search area stretching across 305,000 square kilometers (117,000 square miles) of the Indian Ocean, about 2,600 kilometers (1,600 miles) southwest of Perth, on Australia's west coast.\n\nMerchant ships were also asked to look for any trace of the plane. Nothing has been found, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said.\n\nChina has said it was reviewing radar data and deployed 21 satellites to search the northern corridor of the search area stretching as far as Kazakhstan. Those searches so far have turned up no trace of the plane, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said Wednesday.\n\nEarly in the search, Malaysian officials said they suspected the plane backtracked toward the Strait of Malacca, off western Malaysia. But it took a week for them to confirm Malaysian military radar data suggesting that route.\n\nThai military officials said Tuesday their own radar showed an unidentified plane, possibly Flight 370, flying toward the strait minutes after the Malaysian jet's transponder signal was lost. Air force spokesman Air Vice Marshal Montol Suchookorn said the Thai military doesn't know whether the plane it detected was Flight 370.\n\nInvestigators now will be checking previous Malaysian military radar data against the Thai data to see if they can confirm locations for the plane and possibly a direction it was heading in order to narrow the search area, aviation safety experts said.\n\nThe two sets of data have to be \"overlayed\" to confirm that the hits, or targets, are recording the same plane or that it is indeed a plane and not a flock of birds or even a rainstorm. To do that, investigators need to determine that both radars were looking at the same place in the sky at exactly the same time down to the second.\n\nBecause the plane's transponder had been turned off, the hits don't contain identification, location or altitude. Both radars were recording what's known as a primary return - essentially a radar signal bouncing of an object in the sky and returning.\n\n\"All you see is a little dot moving across the screen,\" said Rory Kay, a U.S. airline training captain and former Air Line Pilots Association safety committee chairman.\n\nMalaysia has said the loss of communications and change in the aircraft's course are consistent with a deliberate diversion of the plane, whether it was the pilots or others aboard who were responsible. Police are considering the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board, but have yet to say what they have uncovered.\n\nMalaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said some sort of problem aboard the plane was not out of the question, although he noted the plane was intact enough to send a signal to a satellite for several hours. Observers have noted that some sort of distress signal would have been likely in the event of a cockpit fire.\n\nAs further confirmation that someone was guiding the plane after it disappeared from civilian radar, airline pilots and aviation safety experts said an onboard computer called the flight management system would have to be deliberately programmed in order to follow the route taken by the plane as described by Malaysian authorities.\n\n\"If you are going to fly the airplane to a waypoint that is not a straight ... route to Beijing, and you were going to command the flight management computer and the autopilot system, you really have to know how to fly the airplane,\" said John Gadzinski, a U.S. Boeing 737 captain.\n\nInvestigators have asked security agencies in countries with passengers on board to check their backgrounds, but no suspicious findings have been announced.","251":"\u00d7 Malaysia Flight 370: Some data deleted from flight simulator\n\nSome information has been deleted from the flight simulator found at the home of the pilot, Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said in a news conference Wednesday.\n\nForensics is trying to recover it, he said.\n\nAt the news conference, he also said:\n\n\u2014 Malaysian authorities have received background information from all countries with passengers on board the plane except Russia and Ukraine. So far, no information of significance has been found, he said.\n\n\u2014 Malaysia has received some radar data, but \u201cwe are not at liberty to release information from other countries.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Reports that the plane was sighted by people in the Maldives are \u201cnot true.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can confirm that the Malaysian Chief of the Defense Force has contacted his counterpart in the Maldives, who has confirmed that these reports are not true,\u201d Hishammuddin said.\n\nWide search, ticking clock\n\nThe search is now in its 12th day, covering a total area roughly the size of the continental United States. That leaves 18 days until the batteries are expected to run out.\n\nThe box containing the flight-data and cockpit-voice recorders of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has batteries designed to keep it sending out pings for 30 days.\n\nInvestigators hope the recorders may reveal vital information about why the passenger jet carrying 239 people veered dramatically off course and disappeared from radar screens. But they have to find them first.\n\nSearchers from at least 26 countries have a formidable task in pinpointing the plane\u2019s location somewhere along two vast arcs, one stretching deep into the Asian landmass, the other far out into the Indian Ocean.\n\n\u201cThe odds of finding the pinger are very slim,\u201d said Rob McCallum, an ocean search specialist. \u201cEven when you know roughly where the target is, it can be very tricky to find the pinger. They have a very limited range.\u201d\n\nA U.S. government official familiar with the investigation told CNN that based on present search patterns and available data, he believes it\u2019s far more likely that the plane would be located in the southern arc of the search area.\n\n\u201cThis is an area out of normal shipping lanes, out of any commercial flight patterns, with few fishing boats and there are no islands,\u201d he said, warning that the search could well last \u201cweeks and not days.\u201d\n\nTechnology put to use\n\nSome of the nations involved in the hunt are deploying an impressive array of technology, including satellites and high-tech submarine-hunting planes, as they try to narrow the search area.\n\nThey\u2019re also trawling through existing radar and satellite data for clues.\n\nAustralia said Wednesday that the area of the southern Indian Ocean where it is searching for the plane has been \u201csignificantly refined.\u201d\n\nThe new area is based on work done by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board on \u201cthe fuel reserves of the aircraft and how far it could have flown,\u201d said John Young of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority.\n\nBut Australian ships and aircraft have so far seen nothing connected to the missing plane, Australian authorities said.\n\nSmall details emerge\n\nMuch of what has emerged in recent days has filled in a few more details about the early part of the missing Boeing 777-200\u2019s flight.\n\nBut clear information on what went on in the cockpit and where exactly the errant jet went after it vanished from Malaysian military radar remains frustratingly elusive.\n\nOn Tuesday, for example, a law enforcement official told CNN that the aircraft\u2019s first major change of course was almost certainly programmed by somebody in the cockpit. The change was entered into the plane\u2019s system at least 12 minutes before a person in the cockpit, believed to be the co-pilot, signed off to air traffic controllers.\n\nBut that disclosure only left more questions about the reason behind the reprogrammed flight path.\n\nSome experts said the change in direction could have been part of an alternate flight plan programmed in advance in case of emergency; others suggested it could show something more nefarious was afoot.\n\nThe Thai military, meanwhile, said it had spotted the plane turning west toward the Strait of Malacca early on March 8. That supports the analysis of Malaysian military radar that has the plane flying out over the Strait of Malacca and into the Indian Ocean.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t make it any clearer where the plane went next. Authorities say information from satellites suggests the plane kept flying for about six hours after it was last detected by Malaysian military radar.\n\nWho was at the controls?\n\nMalaysian authorities, who are coordinating the search, say the available evidence suggests the missing plane flew off course in a deliberate act by someone who knew what they were doing.\n\nFiguring out who that might be has so far left investigators stumped.\n\nParticular attention has focused on the pilot and first officer on Flight 370, but authorities are yet to come up with any evidence explaining why either of them would have taken the jetliner off course.\n\nAnd some experts have warned against hastily jumping to conclusions about the role of the pilots.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked on many cases were the pilots were suspect, and it turned out to be a mechanical and horrible problem,\u201d said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. \u201cAnd I have a saying myself: Sometimes an erratic flight path is heroism, not terrorism\n\nChina says it has found nothing suspicious during background checks on its citizens on the flight \u2014 a large majority of the plane\u2019s passengers.\n\nSearchers face deep ocean\n\nMalaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein, the country\u2019s public face of the search efforts, has repeatedly said at news conferences that little is likely to be established about the mysterious flight until the plane is found.\n\nBut in the Indian Ocean, where Australia and Indonesia have taken the lead in the hunt, some of the depths searchers are dealing with are significant.\n\nThe Bay of Bengal, for example, which lies between Myanmar and India, has depths of between about 4,000 and 7,000 meters (13,000 feet and 23,000 feet), according to McCallum.\n\nWreckage and bodies of passengers from Air France Flight 447, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009, were found at depths of around 12,000 feet by unmanned submarines.\n\nIt took four searches over the course of nearly two years to locate the bulk of the wreckage and the majority of the bodies of the 228 people on board Flight 447. It took even longer to establish the cause of the disaster.\n\nRight now, authorities don\u2019t even know for sure if the missing Malaysian plane crashed or landed \u2014 or where.\n\nCNN has talked to more than half a dozen U.S. military and intelligence officials who emphasize that while no one knows what happened to the plane, it is more logical to conclude it crashed into the Indian Ocean.","252":"Background checks on all but three of the 239 passengers and crew on board a missing Malaysia Airlines jet have produced no \"information of significance\", Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said on Wednesday.\"We have received passengers' background checks from all countries apart from Ukraine and Russia,\" Hishammuddin told reporters at a daily briefing.\"So far no information of significance on any passengers has been found.\" he said.There were two Ukranians and one Russian on the plane.The Malaysian government believes the jet was deliberately diverted and flew for several hours after leaving its scheduled flight path - either north towards Central Asia, or towards the southern Indian Ocean.

A Malaysian government official appealed in vain for the relatives to leave, before they were finally bundled out the door by police in an unseemly melee.\n\nOne woman collapsed to the ground and had to be virtually carried out as she wailed \u201cWhere are they? Where are they?\u201d\n\nThere were more than 150 Chinese people among the 239 passengers and crew aboard the missing Malaysia Airlines plane, which vanished in the early hours of March 8. Their relatives have been angry almost from the outset with the slow and often contradictory information flow coming from the Malaysian government and airline. Some have been flown to Malaysia to wait for news, although most have elected to stay behind in China.\n\nAfter the family members were removed, only their banner was left behind on the floor. A government spokesman ordered it to be rolled up, saying it was not \u201cappropriate\u201d.\n\nView Graphic New data has provided an arc of possible locations for Malaysian Flight MH370.\n\nOn Tuesday, Malaysian officials, faced with mounting frustration over the progress of their investigation of an airliner that disappeared 10 days ago, made an international appeal for help in finding it.\n\nThe search has been bedeviled by scant information and contradictory reports, prompting Chinese Ambassador Huang Huikang on Tuesday to say the Malaysians were \u201cinexperienced and lacking the capacity\u201d to carry out the investigation properly.\n\nMalaysia also has been slow to line up help from other countries, including the United States, that have expertise or information that could speed up the search. Although a group of U.S. crash investigators has been in Kuala Lumpur for more than a week, the nation has not accepted assistance from a team at the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles Field Office waiting to depart for Malaysia.\n\nNor has Malaysia responded to an offer of assistance from a U.S. oceanographic institute, whose expertise in underwater searches helped locate the last major airliner to crash into the sea: Air France Flight 447, which disappeared over the Atlantic in 2009.\n\nBut Malaysia is warming to some of these offers, U.S. officials said. A senior law enforcement official said Tuesday that the Malaysian government is starting to cooperate with the FBI and American intelligence agents in the field after a week of rebuffing help.\n\n\u201cInitially, there was a little bit of fog of war. That has cleared,\u201d the official said. \u201cThey had a hard time pulling this together. Every intelligence agency in the world was beating their door down. I think they were overwhelmed, and that has settled a little bit.\u201d\n\nMalaysia has now sought FBI technical expertise in examining the flight simulator found at the home of the pilot and other items, a U.S. law enforcement official said. There are also fewer than a dozen FBI agents, including the agency\u2019s assistant legal attach\u00e9 and legal attach\u00e9, on the ground in Kuala Lumpur, the official said.\n\nTwo relatives of passengers missing from Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 were forcibly removed a daily briefing to journalists after trying to unfurl a banner. (Reuters)\n\nIn Bangkok, a Thai air force spokesman said that Thai military radar may have spotted Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 just as it steered away from its intended path and after its transponder was cut off. But Air Vice Marshal Montol Suchookorn said officials did not share the information because Malaysia did not specifically request it, the Associated Press reported.\n\nHad Thailand\u2019s disclosure come earlier, it might have directed the search away from the Gulf of Thailand, which crews combed for seven days on the theory that the airliner, with 239 passengers and crew members on board, had perhaps crashed at the same time that it disappeared from civilian radar March 8. The focus of the search now is farther to the west, in particular the Indian Ocean.\n\nMalaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein, at a news conference Tuesday, brushed off criticism that his government has held back information or been slow to follow possible leads. He said Malaysia is cooperating with the FBI and other international law enforcement authorities.\n\n\u201cOur priority has always been to find the aircraft,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would not withhold any information that could help. But we also have a responsibility not to release information until it has been verified by the international investigation team.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cOver the last two days, we have been recalibrating the search for MH370. It remains a significant diplomatic, technical and logistical challenge.\u201d\n\nHe asked the United States on Tuesday to scrutinize data from defense satellites and airborne radar. He also requested more U.S. vessels in the Indian Ocean.\n\n\u201cThe entire search area is now 2.24 million square nautical miles,\u201d Hishammuddin said. \u201cThis is an enormous search area. And it is something Malaysia cannot possibly search on its own.\u201d\n\nSearch grid defined\n\nUnless floating debris from the aircraft is discovered somewhere in that vast area, it becomes increasing unlikely that the plane will be found, U.S. experts said.\n\nIn what has become the largest search on record for an aircraft, Malaysia acknowledged for the first time that other countries needed to take leading roles in scouring a grid about the size of Australia. Malaysia said it has divided that grid into 14 sections and negotiated for Australia, China, Indonesia and Kazakhstan to coordinate efforts in some of those areas.\n\nIf the plane or wreckage is located, the senior U.S. law enforcement official said, the FBI is ready to dispatch additional teams of agents. They could help with forensic analysis of bodies, debris and other material to help determine what happened. The official said the FBI also is prepared to look into the backgrounds of all the passengers and crew members but has not been asked by the Malaysian National Police, which is leading the investigation.\n\n\u201cThe Malaysians have the lead on this, and we stand ready to assist in any way we can,\u201d the official said.\n\nAt the White House, one senior administration official said cooperation with the Malaysian government is proceeding as smoothly as can be expected given the \u201cunusual\u201d nature of the mystery.\n\n\u201cThis is very difficult for any country,\u201d the official said, referring to the Malaysian response. \u201cWe\u2019ve provided a lot of technical assistance in particular, and we helped with the new search area.\u201d\n\nAt the National Security Council, officials are monitoring the response from the Defense and State departments, the National Transportation Safety Board and the FBI, and the staff has had \u201cworking level\u201d meetings with various agencies. But the effort has been based out of the U.S. Embassy in Kuala Lumpur, the official said. The United States has added a few staff members to assist at the embassy.\n\nCiting U.S. officials, the New York Times reported Monday that Flight MH370\u2019s westward turn away from its route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing was programmed into the plane\u2019s computer system, suggesting that whoever steered the Boeing 777 had technical expertise.\n\n\u201cIf this turn point was loaded in on the ground before takeoff, then both pilots would have to agree on that being part of the flight plan, which is unlikely,\u201d said Ron Carr, a retired airline pilot who teaches at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Arizona. \u201cIt would be easier and less likely to call attention to a \u2018not authorized waypoint\u2019 for it to be loaded [after takeoff] when the course change is to be conducted.\u201d\n\nFinding Air France Flight 447\n\nAlthough Malaysian authorities have appealed for help with the underwater search, they have not responded to offers from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts, which found Air France Flight 447.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried every way we can at Woods Hole just to have a conversation with someone in Malaysia,\u201d said Dave Gallo of Woods Hole. \u201cWe offered through our State Department, and then we tried to go directly to the Malaysians and to Boeing. Nothing.\u201d\n\nGallo said that if the plane is underwater, searchers first must find evidence of its location by spotting debris on the surface.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s similar to finding a needle in a haystack, which is doable these days if you have the right tools,\u201d he said. \u201cSo knowing that we\u2019re at least looking in the right haystack is important. We don\u2019t want to be looking in the Gulf of Thailand in shallow water and then they say it\u2019s off the coast of Perth [Australia] in deep water.\u201d\n\nFive days after the Air France crash, floating debris was located. Using water currents and the final communications from the aircraft, investigators narrowed the search area to 40 square miles. Brought in after the plane\u2019s locator box stopped sending underwater signals, the Woods Hole team found the Airbus A330 more than 11,000 feet below the surface, almost two years after it went down.\n\nThe longer it takes to find floating evidence of Flight MH370, the more problematic the search becomes. Narrowing the area to scour would allow ships towing sonar sleds on long tethers to focus on that section before the 30-day battery life runs out on an underwater beacon emitting homing signals every second.\n\nAs time passes, floating debris drifts and disperses. Experts can evaluate those patterns based on the time the material has been in the water and pinpoint where to search. If the search narrows from millions of square miles to just a few dozen, it becomes a matter of bringing in the right equipment.\n\nShips towing sonar sleds must move at less than two miles an hour or risk breaking the miles-long line that lets their equipment sink thousands of feet below the surface. The better choice is autonomous underwater vehicles \u2014 unmanned mini-submarines.\n\n\u201cThey have the ability of running very precise lines on the sea floor, just like plowing a field or mowing the lawn,\u201d said Gallo, whose team also mapped the remains of the Titanic ocean liner on the bottom of the Atlantic.\n\nGallo said assembling a fleet of AUVs, if a search area can be narrowed, is a challenge.\n\n\u201cThey are scattered all over the Earth,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a couple of companies that can respond. There are a couple of oceanographic institutes like ourselves that can respond, but no one\u2019s got dozens of vehicles. Everyone\u2019s got one or two, and who knows where they are?\u201d If that focus comes down to the waters off Perth, he said, that is \u201cone of the most in\u00adcred\u00adibly complicated underwater terrains on the planet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis place is not only rugged, but it\u2019s unpredictable,\u201d he added. \u201cIt can be a high plateau, a deep valley, a mountain slope, so it\u2019s difficult.\u201d\n\nAustralia said Tuesday that it will take several weeks to search its area, with help coming Wednesday from New Zealand and the United States.

Over the course of a year, the number has dropped by 363,200.\n\n'Improving economy'\n\nEmployment Minister Esther McVey said the overall fall in unemployment showed that \"the growing economy is helping record numbers of people to find a job\".\n\n\"The rise in employment is being fuelled by businesses and entrepreneurs across the country who are feeling increasingly confident with the improving economy,\" she added.\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron tweeted: \"Another significant fall in unemployment is a sign our long-term economic plan is working, providing security and chances for hard-working people.\"\n\nBut shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves disagreed, saying \"long-term youth unemployment has doubled under David Cameron\".\n\n\"It's clear tens of thousands of young people are not feeling any recovery at all,\" she said.\n\nImage caption The North East has the highest rate of unemployment in the UK at 9.5%\n\n\"Today's figures also show that working people facing a cost-of-living crisis and that prices are still rising faster than wages under David Cameron.\"\n\nSpending support\n\nDavid Tinsley, an economist at BNP Paribas, said that while the employment figures were promising, there were some weak areas, pointing out that the rise in employment was down to the increase in the number of self-employed.\n\nMedia caption Rachel Reeves welcomed the fall, but said there were still areas of concern\n\nHe also noted that the average weekly hours worked by full-time UK employees was down by 0.2%.\n\nHowever, Mr Tinsley added: \"The pick-up in earnings growth and a decent rise in employment, alongside falling inflation, means the prospects for real income growth are looking better. That in turn can help support a more sustainable rise in consumer spending this year.\n\nDavid Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said that while youth unemployment had gone down, the rate was \"still nearly three times the rate of unemployment as a whole\".\n\nEarnings \"remain below inflation\", he added.\n\nRegional variation\n\nThe North East of England has the highest unemployment rate in the UK, at 9.5%. In the South East, where the rate is lowest, only 5.2% are out of work.\n\nThe unemployment rate in Scotland fell to 6.9%, in Wales it was 6.7% while in Northern Ireland it was 7.5%.\n\nJust over 10% more men are employed than women in the UK, but the unemployment rate for men was higher than for women, with 7.4% of the male labour force out of work.\n\nThere were 159,000 fewer people employed in the public sector in December 2013, compared with the September figure. However, a large part of this reduction was due to the privatisation of Royal Mail.\n\nThe figures for unemployment in the three months to January are based on the Labour Force Survey, in which the ONS speaks to 60,000 households once a quarter, making it the country's biggest household survey.\n\nThe ONS is 95% confident that the unemployment figure is correct to plus or minus 81,000 people.\n\nRecovery 'broadening'\n\nSeparately, the Bank of England released the minutes from the latest meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee.\n\nThe minutes showed that all nine MPC members voted earlier this month to keep interest rates at 0.5% and to keep the programme of quantitative easing unchanged at \u00a3375bn, as expected.\n\nThe MPC noted the recovery in the UK economy was widening beyond consumer spending.\n\n\"There were initial signs that the anticipated broadening from household to business spending might have already begun,\" the minutes said.\n\n\"Even so, there remained some way to go to ensure that the recovery was both balanced and sustainable.\"","261":"First name This field is required.

1.5 per cent \u2013 while the devolved civil service increased by 300 - 1.6 per cent - largely due to increased employment in the Scottish Prison Service in preparation for the opening of a new prison.\n\nIn the reserved civil service employment was down by 1,100 -

Private sector employment is now 662,000 higher than a year ago.\n\nThe unemployment rate, now 7.2%, is no longer linked to the Bank of England\u2019s pledge to keep interest rates at record lows after governor Mark Carney unveiled new forward guidance. The bank had pledged not to consider a rate rise until unemployment fell to 7%.\n\nEmployment Minister Esther McVey said: \u201cWe now have the highest employment rate for five years, which shows that the growing economy is helping record numbers of people to find a job, turn their lives around and have the security of a regular wage.\n\n\u201cThe rise in employment is being fuelled by businesses and entrepreneurs across the country who are feeling increasingly confident with the improving economy. They should be congratulated for creating over 1.7 million private sector jobs since 2010 - that\u2019s over 1,000 more people in private sector jobs every day.\u201d\n\nPaul Kenny, GMB general secretary, said: \u201cThis has been the longest recession in living memory. The Government has to show more urgency to help its main victims, nearly one million young workers out of work, into proper jobs. GMB will assess today\u2019s Budget on what it does to avoid a lost generation.\u201d\n\nDavid Cameron tweeted: \u201cAnother significant fall in unemployment is a sign our long-term economic plan is working, providing security & chances for hard-working people.\u201d\n\nRachel Reeves, shadow work and pensions secretary, said: \u201cWhile today\u2019s fall in overall unemployment is welcome, the figures show 912,000 young people are unemployed and long-term youth unemployment has doubled under David Cameron. It\u2019s clear tens of thousands of young people are not feeling any recovery at all.\n\n\u201cThere has also been a worrying rise in the number of people unemployed for over two years.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s figures also show that working people facing a cost-of-living crisis and that prices are still rising faster than wages under David Cameron.\u201d\n\nTUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: \u201cThe economy is generating jobs but too many are insecure and poorly paid.\n\n\u201cThe fall in the number of employees is especially worrying for women as recent figures showed a 42% gender pay gap among self-employed workers, with most women earning less than \u00a310,000.\n\n\u201cSo far economic growth has failed to improve job security or generate decent pay rises. This must change if the benefits of recovery are to be felt by hard-working people.\u201d\n\nDavid Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cThese figures show that while the UK labour market remains strong and flexible, the pace of improvement is slowing. Youth unemployment edged down slightly, but with the rate at 19.8%, it is still nearly three times the rate of unemployment as a whole.\n\n\u201cWhile earnings growth increased slightly it remains below inflation. For pay to increase further, we need to see similar increases in productivity in order to sustain it.\n\n\u201cOverall the jobs market is still improving, and suggests that the recovery is making progress. Against this backdrop, in his Budget speech we hope that the Chancellor makes every effort to tackle youth unemployment, while introducing measures to boost investment and exports.\u201d\n\nUnite general secretary Len McCluskey said: \u201cWhile the drop in unemployment by 63,000 is to be welcomed, this can\u2019t disguise the thrust of government policy which is towards a low waged economy where insecure employment is rampant.\n\n\u201cUrgent measures are needed in today\u2019s Budget and in the coming months to tackle the two large pools of persistent unemployment - the young and the long term jobless - that continue to be a thorn in the side of the chancellor.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t tolerate an economic landscape that offers precious little hope of real jobs for our young people.\n\n\u201cToo much of what good economic news there has been is skewed towards London and the South East.\u201d\n\nUnison general secretary Dave Prentis said: \u201cThe small drop in the number unemployed is hardly something to celebrate as it masks the reality of the rising number of those underemployed with zero hour contracts, or forced to take part time jobs because they cannot find full-time employment.\n\n\u201cThe state of the labour market still remains a major issue. Today\u2019s figures show that the Government\u2019s austerity measures are continuing to bite into public services, with another 25,000 local government workers forced out of work. Today\u2019s Budget is a opportunity for Osborne to reverse some of his drastic measures and alleviate the pain of the six million working people living in poverty.\u201d\n\nDr John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist, said: \u201cAt last we are seeing signs that the economic recovery is breathing life into the pay figures. The combination of job vacancies rising back toward the pre-recession level and falling unemployment has lifted pay growth to within sight of price inflation, especially in the private sector where the real pay squeeze eased markedly around the turn of the year.\n\n\u201cIt is now very likely that the average real pay squeeze will end in the coming months, with private sector workers set to enjoy real pay rises for the first time since 2009.\u201d\n\nIan Brinkley, chief economist at The Work Foundation, said: \u201cThese figures tell us that current forecasts that unemployment will fall towards 6% by the end of 2015 are entirely plausible.\n\n\u201cIt is all the more important that the 2014 Budget sets out effective measures to ensure that disadvantaged groups, such as less qualified young people, can also take advantage of these new opportunities. And the challenge remains to translate growth into improved productivity and higher pay alongside more jobs.\u201d\n\nJohn Allan, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \u201cToday\u2019s unemployment figures indicate further improvement in the jobs market and match reports we\u2019ve been hearing from our members. Many have told us they have recently increased their headcount and they expect to employ more staff in the next quarter.\n\n\u201cAs confidence in the economy grows, it is important that the momentum of previous quarters is maintained and this can only be achieved by maximising the job creation potential of small businesses.\u201d","267":"The British government was given a pre-budget boost with new figures showing a record number of people in work and continuing falls in unemployment.\n\nJust over 30 million people are now in jobs, up by 459,000 on a year ago, the highest figure since records began in 1971.\n\nThe jobless total fell by 63,000 in the quarter to January to 2.33 million, a rate of 7.2 per cent.

Jobless claims, a narrower measure of unemployment, fell 34,600, and wage growth accelerated.\n\nThe data was published as the BOE released the minutes of its March Monetary Policy Committee meeting, showing officials voted unanimously to keep the benchmark rate at a record-low 0.5 percent. The MPC said the pound\u2019s advance had led to a tightening of financial conditions and the currency may appreciate further as the economy strengthens.\n\n\u201cSterling had appreciated by another 1.5 percent during the month, and it was possible that this gradual appreciation would continue if prospects in the U.K. continued to be seen as increasingly favorable relative to those of it\u2019s main trading partners,\u201d the BOE said.\n\nBritain\u2019s currency reached $1.6823 on Feb. 17, the highest level since November 2009. It rose 0.2 percent today to $1.6621 as of 10:25 a.m. London time.\n\nRate Expectations\n\nThe BOE is \u201ckeen to keep rate-hike expectations pushed back with an emphasis on sterling strength,\u201d said James Knightley, an economist at ING Bank in London. \u201cNonetheless, with the U.K. growth and employment story looking very healthy we are comfortable with the view that the BOE will end up tightening policy within the next twelve months.\u201d\n\nThe MPC is currently operating under its first form of forward guidance and won\u2019t consider increasing its benchmark rate at least until unemployment falls to 7 percent. The pledge has knockouts linked to the inflation outlook and the MPC said today that none of those have been breached.\n\n\u201cAll members agreed that the probability of inflation being above 2.5 percent in 18-24 months time remained less than 50 percent,\u201d the MPC said. \u201cIf anything the appreciation of sterling on the month made that prospect a little less likely.\u201d\n\nThe report came hours before Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announces his annual budget to Parliament. His fiscal watchdog is likely to raise its 2014 growth forecast to 2.7 percent from 2.4 percent, according to a Bloomberg survey.\n\nIn the minutes, the BOE said there were signs that U.K. growth was broadening, though there remained \u201csome way to go to ensure that the recovery was both balanced and sustainable.\u201d\n\nUnemployment Rate\n\nThe ILO unemployment rate was in line with the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey. Unemployment fell 63,000 to 2.33 million people in the three months through January compared with the August-October period. Monthly estimates based on a restricted sample show the jobless rate fell to 6.9 percent in January, the lowest since February 2009.\n\nThe drop in jobless claims last month, the 16th in a row, was more than the 25,000 predicted in a Bloomberg survey, and pushed the claimant-count rate down to 3.5 percent.

The Bank of England clearly wants to give the economy every chance to develop broader-based recovery.\"\n\nThe Office for National Statistics also reported a fall in the number of people working part-time because they could not find full-time work - down by 32,000 in the latest quarter to 1.4 million, although still 41,000 higher than a year ago.\n\n\"A positive interpretation of the latest data is that it could be an early sign that productivity is finally starting to pick up modestly with more companies making increasing use of their existing workers rather than taking on new workers. This would be highly welcome news for the economy\u2019s longer-term growth prospects,\" Mr Archer added.\n\nThe proportion of the working age population - those aged 16 to 64 - in employment hit 72.3pc, up from 71.5pc a year ago.\n\nNumbers of people aged 16 to 64 who had given up looking for work and were classed as \"economically inactive\" fell by 19,000 to 8.90m in the period.\n\nBernard Brown, partner and head of business services, KPMG Management Consulting, said: \u201cThe latest jobs figures are just what the Chancellor would have wanted to see as he put the finishing touches to his Budget. Recent improvements to UK construction figures, combined with an increased demand for engineers, means that it won\u2019t be a surprise to see employment rising across other sectors.

The last time the state's rate was lower was in August 2008 when the rate was 6.7 percent.\n\nOregon's unemployment rate has been steadily trending down for more than four years as the economy has recovered from the Great Recession. Recent declines were coupled with moderate employment growth as indicated by the more than 2,000 jobs added in both January and February.\n\nIn February, seasonally adjusted nonfarm payroll employment rose by 2,900 following a revised gain of 2,100 in January. February marked the 8th consecutive monthly gain. The private sector has expanded even longer; the last private-sector job loss was 20 months ago. Manufacturing added 1,000 jobs in February when a loss of 100 is the normal seasonal pattern. The components with the largest gains were food manufacturing (+400 jobs), computer and electronic product manufacturing (+200), and transportation equipment manufacturing (+200).\n\nFood manufacturing continued its steady expansion of the past eight years, hitting a new February record of 25,300 jobs. Gains in recent years have accelerated in most component industries with particularly rapid expansions in these three: tortilla, confectionery, and seasoning and dressing.\n\nThe BLS estimates of monthly job gains and losses are based on a survey of businesses.These preliminary estimates are subject to later revision.\n\nNext Press Releases The Oregon Employment Department plans to release the February county and metropolitan area unemployment rates on Monday, March 24th and the statewide unemployment rate and employment survey data for March on Tuesday, April 15th . The Oregon Employment Department is responsible for releasing Oregon's monthly payroll employment and labor force data. The data are prepared in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Labor , Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The BLS estimates of monthly job gains and losses are based on a survey of businesses. The BLS estimates of unemployment are based on a survey of households and other inputs.\n\nThe Oregon Employment Department publishes payroll employment estimates that are revised quarterly by using employment counts from employer unemployment insurance tax records.

Employers added a seasonally adjusted 2,900 jobs last month, on top of an upwardly revised 2,100 jobs in January.\n\nOregon's construction and manufacturing industries added 1,100 seasonally adjusted jobs apiece, helping to counterbalance leisure and hospitality sector job cuts. The industry, which includes restaurants, bars and hotels, shed 2,200 jobs last month after adjusting for seasonal factors.\n\nPublic agencies, for their part, chipped into the state's jobs growth. The government sector posted a net gain of 1,000 jobs in February, according to the state report.\n\nFebruary marked the 8th month in a row that Oregon's economy created more new jobs than it lost, and the first time since August 2008 that unemployment fell below 7.0 percent. The state's unemployment rate jumped in late 2008, shooting as high as 11.6 percent in the depth of the recession. The measure hovered near 10 percent until mid-2011.\n\nBy February 2013, Oregon's unemployment rate had fallen to 8.1 percent. A year later, in February of this year, it stands at 6.9 percent. In comparison, the national unemployment rate in February was 6.7 percent.\n\nThe swift declines were partly caused by the growing amount of people leaving the labor force, pushing the percentage of adults in the workforce to historic lows. Economists have pointed to demographic and economic reasons behind the decline, but the latter appears to be leveling off as the job market improves. The state's labor force participation rate, which declined steadily through the recession and recovery, has hovered near 61.2 percent for the past six months.\n\nOther labor market signs are also encouraging. The number of people in Oregon's labor force is roughly equal to what it was a year ago, at just over 1.9 million. And 22,000 more people reported that they had jobs compared to the same time a year ago. The number of people who said they were out of work dropped by the same amount.\n\nOregon's U-6 rate, a proxy for underemployment, was 15.6 percent in February, down from 15.8 percent in January. The measure counts people who are unemployed, or stuck in part-time jobs, or in and out of the labor market.\n\n-- Molly Young\n\n","297":"Oregon\u2019s unemployment rate fell to 6.9 percent in February, the first time it has been below 7 percent in five years, the state Employment Department said Tuesday.\n\nThat is the lowest jobless rate for the state since August 2008, when unemployment was 6.7 percent, shortly before the recession hit Oregon full force.\n\nThe state\u2019s unemployment rate has been on a downward trend for more than four years, state economists said. February was the eighth month in a row that the state added jobs \u2014 about 2,900 in all, following a gain of 2,100 in January \u2014 helping to bring down the jobless rate.\n\nManufacturing was one of the leaders in job creation last month, adding 1,000 jobs when a loss of 100 was expected, based on normal seasonal patterns, the state Employment Department said.

Gains in recent years have accelerated in most component industries, they said, with particularly rapid expansions in three: tortilla; confectionery; and seasoning and dressing.\n\nEugene-based So Delicious Dairy Free is among the food manufacturers growing rapidly and looking to hire. The number of people who lost jobs during the recession and early stages of recovery is giving them plenty to choose from.\n\nSo Delicious, which is best known locally for vegan frozen desserts, held a job fair last month, looking to add 30 employees to its existing staff of 175. It received about 400 applications, said Judy Moore, director of human resources.\n\nSo Delicious has been looking to fill a variety of jobs, from food production, shipping and quality compliance to food technology, system administration and digital marketing.\n\n\u201cOur entire company is growing,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThe healthy food market is really expanding and our business just happens to be poised to take advantage of that.\n\n\u201cI expect by the end of this week we will have hired 10 (new employees),\u201d she added.\n\nSome positions are easier to fill than others, Moore said. So Delicious targeted the job fair particularly to employees of RV manufacturer Monaco, which had just announced it was closing its local plant in Harrisburg.\n\nA lot of the 400 applications the company received came from former Monaco employees and also people who had lost jobs in the wood products industry, Moore said, adding that both groups have skills that could be transferred to food production.\n\nFinding people to fill some of the company\u2019s other positions, such as digital marketing, is tougher, she said. \u201cYou can get marketing people that have the traditional skills,\u201d she said, but people who have really embraced digital marketing are in short supply \u2014 and everyone is competing for them.\n\nAs a result, Moore said, \u201cWages are going up.\u201d\n\nAlong with manufacturing, the construction industry also fared better in February than it usually does this time of year, said David Cooke, a state economist. Construction, which was expected to lose about 1,100 jobs in February, didn\u2019t lose any, he said.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening is construction, primarily residential construction, has been recovering from the very low level of 2009, \u201910, \u201911 and \u201912,\u201d Cooke said. \u201cAs the number of new structures increases, employment has been increasing. If you look at the building permit numbers statewide, they\u2019re still growing rapidly, but (starting) from a very low base.\n\n\u201cI believe we\u2019re still below the 20-year average (for building permits),\u201d he said, \u201cWe had this very severe boom and bust cycle, (and) it\u2019s taking a long time for residential construction to reach more normal levels.\u201d\n\nUnlike construction, some other industries escaped the recession largely unscathed, Cooke said, including private educational services, which includes private preschools on up through private colleges.\n\n\u201cI looked at data going back to 1990,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really see any negative employment effects from the recession. The same is true with health care and social assistance.\u201d\n\nHome Instead Senior Care, which falls under the latter category, is another local company that continues to hire.\n\nHome Instead, which provides services to seniors that allow them to remain in their own homes, recently filled an administrative coordinator position from within, Executive Director Nancy NesSmith said. And it is looking to hire an adminstrative assistant and a scheduling assistant as a result of the internal shuffle, she said.\n\nIt is also hiring 15 more caregivers this month, NesSmith said, \u201cAnd in April we\u2019ll hire another 21.\u201d The company currently employs just under 200 people, she said.\n\nThe company\u2019s current rapid growth is partly being fueled by the federal Affordable Care Act, which infused more money into Medicaid, part of it going to pay for home care, NesSmith said.\n\nIt is also being fueled, she said, by the aging of America, with more people needing help at home, including people who bought long-term care insurance and are now using it. Services can range from shopping and cooking for someone to helping them with personal care, she said.\n\nNot all of Home Instead\u2019s hires lead directly to lowering the unemployment rate, though, NesSmith said. Empty-nesters who are done raising their children, or people who provided home care for a relative or friend are ideal job candidates for Home Instead, she said. Those may well be people who haven\u2019t worked outside the home for years, and so aren\u2019t counted as unemployed members of the workforce.\n\nIn general, the parts of the state that are recovering fastest from the recession, with unemployment rates that were lower than the statewide average in recent mnoths, are northwestern Oregon, the Willamette Valley \u2014 including the Portland area \u2014 and the Columbia Gorge area, according to Employment Department figures.\n\nEastern and Southern Oregon, including coastal counties, have had unemployment rates above the statewide average in recent months.\n\nFollow Ilene on Twitter @ialeshire.

Now we're seeing the sort of job growth that as economists we'd like to see coming out of a recession,\" says Beleiciks.\n\nStill, he says long-term unemployment continues to be relatively high.\n\nRoughly a third of those who are unemployed have been without work for more than 6 months.

The new design will be in the same gold and silver colours as the euro and is particularly hard to copy. \"With advances in technology making high-value coins like the \u00a31 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency,\" said Osborne.\n\nHow big a problem are fake coins?\n\nThe Royal Mint estimates that around 3% of the \u00a31 coins are fake \u2013 which could mean more than \u00a345m worth of counterfeit coins are in circulation. Individuals and companies are not allowed to pass on coins they know to be counterfeit, so ending up with fakes can be costly.\n\nWill the new coin fit parking and vending machines?\n\nNot as it stands, according to the Royal Mint. Andrew Mills, the head of circulation for the Mint, told the BBC it was \"a likelihood\" that the coin would not fit in machines designed for the existing \u00a31. The new coin will not be accepted by many automated vending and ticket machines and may not fit in supermarket trolley or locker slots.\n\nThe change could prove expensive for firms and councils needing to alter parking meters, vending machines and shopping trolleys. When new, thicker 5p and 10p coins were introduced in 2012, town halls complained that the switch could cost them \u00a35.5m.\n\nWon't it be a similar size?\n\nYes. But the need to change machines may arise from the \"metal composition\" of the new coin, according to Jo Audley of the British Parking Association. \"The current security elements built into machines are designed to measure the metal composition of the coin,\" she says. \"So if they're considered conterfeit or the machine fails to read the composition correctly, they are rejected. At present, 4% of \u00a31 coins used in parking meters are counterfeit. We need to to ascertain what metals are being used and how this recallibrates into the machine, and we don't know yet.\"\n\nThe cost of a change, if needed, will depend on what parts in the current machines need altering, and how this is rolled out across different parking schemes, but the association says all machines, of which there are around 100,000, could need changing. \"A lot of companies are using cashless systems through mobile apps and credit card payments,\" said Audley.\n\nIf the machines are upgraded from a standard coin-operated machine to offering a cashless payments, this will push up the cost of upgrading, she added.\n\nToday I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy - starting with a resilient pound coin pic.twitter.com\/Ev2IuNpXg4 \u2014 George Osborne (@George_Osborne) March 19, 2014\n\nWhat about businesses?\n\nThe cost is expected to mainly fall on firms operating around 400,000 machines \u2013 selling anything from train tickets to snacks \u2013 while payphones, fruit machines and supermarket trolleys will also have to be changed.\n\nA spokesman for the British Retail Consortium welcomed the news but said: \"It is important for industry that any potential change is effectively planned and managed in order to minimise hardware costs for business. The BRC will engage with both the government and the Royal Mint to support a smooth transition period.\"\n\nJohn Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \"Small firms who deal with low-priced items are more likely to be affected by fake currency but we do have concerns about the extra costs of introducing a new pound coin. For example, small firms may have to pay out to replace machinery. But, there's no doubt counterfeit coins and notes can seriously damage small businesses. Not only are they worthless but a business could be prosecuted if it passes them on.\"\n\nHow much will the change cost?\n\nThe Royal Mint has not said how much it will cost to make the new coins, but it says \u00a32m has so far been invested in developing the new security techniques used on the machines. Mills said 90% of the changes were likely to be straightforward, and cost around \u00a310 to \u00a312 per machine, and that cost of changing all the machines in the country is likely to between \u00a315 and \u00a320m.\n\nHowever the British Parking Association says just changing parking machines could cost \u00a350m. And, of course, there's also the cost to consumers of replacing all those trolley token keyrings.","322":"News 19 Mar 2014 11:36am The Budget: what we know so far Among the dozens of predictions that are flying around in anticipation of the chancellor\u2019s Budget Speech today, there are three measures that the Treasury has made public\n\nAs well as today\u2019s announcement about the new 12-sided \u00a31 coin, George Osborne announced on Sunday that he would be giving support to the house-building sector by extending the Help to Buy equity loan scheme to 2020 and providing a further \u00a36bn investment to help 120,000 more households purchase a new-build home.\n\nHe also announced plans to invest \u00a3200m in developing 15,000 new homes around the high speed rail station at Ebbsfleet in Kent.

The coin collector estimated the penny could be worth $250,000, and the two men agreed to auction it off. They plan to donate up to $100,000 of the proceeds to local homeless programs and split the rest between them.\n\nThe government briefly considered switching to aluminum due to a spike in copper prices during the previous year. In 1973, Chile\u2019s democratically-elected president, Salvador Allende, nationalized U.S. copper mines, which helped set off a crisis that not only impacted the price of copper but also resulted in Allende being overthrown in a military coup backed by the Central Intelligence Agency under President Richard Nixon.\n\nMint officials ultimately decided to scrap the idea of making pennies out of aluminum, though not before 1.5 million of the coins were produced.\n\nThe aluminum pennies were never issued, and most were destroyed. A few were given to members of Congress.\n\nLawrence says the penny belonged to his father, Harry Lawrence, who worked as deputy superintendent at the Denver Mint for 20 years, including the year the coin was struck. The younger Lawrence found it among his father\u2019s belongings after his death in 1980.\n\n\u201cWhen he died\u2026that coin and others he received over the years were in a plastic sandwich bag,\u201d recalled Lawrence, according to CoinNews.net. \u201cI kept them in that bag in my desk for 33 years\u2026 I had no idea what that penny was worth.\u201d\n\nMcConnell initially thought the penny was a low-value foreign souvenir coin. He discovered its real value sometime after purchasing the collection from Lawrence. He got back in touch with him to disclose what he had learned. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t [have been] able to sleep without notifying him,\" McConnell said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a godsend,\u201d Lawrence told the San Diego Union-Tribune. \u201cFor someone so honest to come back to me and want to share this with me really got me to the core.\u201d\n\nRegardless of how Lawrence came to possess the coin, the Treasury Department contends it's not his to sell.\n\nBecause the aluminum pennies were never officially issued, the department claims that all such coins are still government property and should be returned.\n\nLawrence rejects this notion.\n\n\u201cThousands of coins minted by or for the U.S. Mint that were never \u2018issued\u2019 as legal tender have been widely and publicly collected and purchased and sold by coin collectors and dealers for over a century without any claims whatsoever from the government,\u201d he says in the lawsuit. \u201cThese include coins that were actually sold or \u2018gifted\u2019 by the Mint itself such as the aluminum cents, as well as coins that left the Mint under unknown circumstances.\u201d\n\nLawrence has called the government\u2019s position \u201cradical,\u201d and asked a federal judge to invalidate the Treasury Department\u2019s claim to the penny.\n\nMeanwhile, Heritage Auctions plans to sell the penny for Lawrence and McConnell at a coin convention in April.\n\n-Noel Brinkerhoff, Danny Biederman\n\nTo Learn More:\n\nCollector Says Uncle Sam Has no Right to His Rare 1974 Aluminum Penny (by Elizabeth Warmerdam, Courthouse News Service)\n\n1974 Aluminum Lincoln Cent from Denver Mint Authenticated, at Long Beach (by Darrin Lee Unser, CoinNews.net)\n\nA Penny Saved Could Net Pair $250,000 (by Pam Kragen, San Diego Union-Tribune)","334":"It may not buy you much these days but is the pound in your pocket actually worth anything at all?\n\nWith an estimated \u00a345m fake \u00a31 coins in circulation the Royal Mint is set to introduce a new 12-sided version which it says is designed to be the \"most secure in the world\".\n\nThe coin will be introduced in 2017 amid concerns about how easy it is to counterfeit the current 30-year-old design.\n\nThe Royal Mint believes 3% of existing \u00a31 coins are fake, and that the move to update the coin will increase \"public confidence\" in the UK's currency and reduce costs for banks and other businesses.\n\nSo, with all these worthless coins floating around the currency system how do you know if you've got one?\n\nDepending on the quality of the counterfeit coin they may be easy to spot.

This means that the weight often feels different to genuine pound coins and the surfaces are notably different.\n\nThe Royal Mint warns of warning signs:\n\n\u2022 The date and design on the reverse do not match (the reverse design is changed each year).

The design on the reverse of the coin corresponds with a specific year of production. A list of the correct designs can be found here\n\n- Colour. If the colour does not match the usual colour of most pound coins it is likely to be fake, or if on old coin shows no sign of ageing it could be fake.\n\n- Milled edge.

The background to the two rental arrangements are entirely different, writes the Irish Times. McDonald's has negotiated a lower rent under a new lease agreement while the Bewley's lease is still subject to five yearly upwards-only reviews. McDonald's had been paying an overall rent of \u20ac1.15 million under a 35-year lease which ran out at the end of 2011. That figure has now dropped to \u20ac600,000 and with upwards-only clauses no longer allowed, five yearly reviews are now based primarily on open market rental values. The landlords in this case - Royal London Mutual Life and Pension Fund - had indicated in advance of the review that it would also be looking for a premium of at least 30% on the rent to take account of the scarcity value of having a round-the-clock food business on the city's premier high street and also because of the sheer size of the building - it extends to 1,858sq m (20,000sq ft). Natalie Brennan of CBRE said the issue of the premium \"was factored into the discussions and was taken on board\".

As well as heading up the unit, Mr Donovan sat on the group executive committee, the team under chief executive Richie Boucher that oversees the day-to-day running of the bank. Following his retirement the role of head of group non-core division is \"no longer required\", according to an internal memo sent to staff and seen by the newspaper. The group non-core division was responsible for meeting a \"deleveraging\" target set for the bank, which included selling off \u20ac10 billion of international loan assets, as well as being charged with the bank's management of NAMA loans. Its understood the decision not to appoint a senior manager to replace Mr Donovan reflects the fact that much of the unit's work has already been completed.

In October's budget, Mr Noonan included a measure that required any company incorporated in Ireland to be tax resident either in this country or another jurisdiction. Multinationals had been exploiting a loophole in the Irish tax system that enabled them to incorporate companies here that were not tax resident in any other state. In response to a parliamentary question from Michael McGrath, Fianna F\u00e1il's finance spokesman, Mr Noonan said no companies had been affected by this change. \"I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have not, to date, been advised by any company that is or will be affected by the change in residence rules as to where it is actually resident following the announcement of the change in the budget,\" he said.

The chancellor took a personal interest in the design of the new coin, whose retro-look will incorporate anti-forgery features which Mr Osborne claims will make it the most secure coin in circulation in the world, says the Financial Times. In a Budget with little money for populist \u201cgiveaways\u201d, Mr Osborne\u2019s back-to-the-future coin may turn out to be one of the biggest talking points of his statement. Mr Osborne says the current \u00a31 coin, which has been in circulation for over 30 years, is increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiters so that about 3% of all the coins in circulation are fakes. In his role as Master of the Mint, Mr Osborne will announce plans for a replacement coin to be introduced in 2017, of bimetallic construction and of two colours, but crucially with 12 sides. Treasury officials admit the coin\u2019s resemblance to the old threepenny bit has little to do with security and everything to do with nostalgia; the new design is a reincarnation of a coin that was in circulation from 1937 until decimalisation 1971.","377":"A NEW 12-sided one pound coin based on the threepenny bit is being unveiled - and is said to be the hardest in the world to fake.\n\nDescribed as a \"giant leap into the future\" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that three per cent in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million.\n\nThe coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the 'Threepenny bit', which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nBut unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain an array of technological advances making it difficult to forge.\n\nAs well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing \u00a32 coin, the new \u00a31 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales.\n\nA Treasury spokesman said: \u201cAfter 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current \u00a31 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.\n\n\u201cWith advances in technology making high value coins like the \u00a31 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of \u201cWe are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic Threepenny bit.\u201d\n\nRoyal Mint chief executive Adam Lawrence hailed the \u201cexciting project\u201d, adding: \u201cThe current \u00a31 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.\n\n\u201cIt is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process.\n\n\u201cWe're extremely proud that the proposal includes the Royal Mint's Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS) technology, offering greater currency security at a lower cost.\u201d\n\nAs with all coins, the Queen's effigy will be on the 'heads' side, but the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the design for the 'tails' side.\n\nA Bank of England spokesman added: \u201cCoins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the Bank's decision to produce polymer banknotes, this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency.\u201d\n\nNational Crime Agency counterfeiting expert John Sheridan said: \u201cThe issuing of a new coin with enhanced security features will make it more difficult for criminals to copy as well as presenting increased opportunities for law enforcement to investigate and disrupt the producers and distributors of counterfeit currency.\u201d\n\n-What do you think about the plans for a 12-sided \u00a31 coin?

However, Treasury sources made clear it would come into force in Scotland only if there was a No vote in September's referendum.\n\nThe new coin will have the same shape as the old 12-sided three pence piece, known in pre-decimalisation days as the \"thrupenny bit\".\n\nThe current \u00a31 coin has been in circulation for more than 30 years, which is much longer than the normal life cycle of a British coin. But it is becoming increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiters. Of the 1.5billion in circulation, the Royal Mint estimates 3%, representing \u00a345m, are fakes. In some parts of the UK, the number of forgeries is as high as 6%.\n\nThe Treasury explained that while law enforcement agencies were successfully cracking down on the counterfeiters, the only sustainable way forward was to introduce a new, highly secure coin, that would reduce costs to business and the taxpayer.\n\nThe expectation is the new coin will be introduced in 2017. It is intended that, as with the current \u00a31 coin, its obverse side will have images that represent the different parts of the UK.\n\nBut a senior Whitehall source stressed that, because all the main Westminster parties had ruled out a currency union between the UK and Scotland in the event of a Yes vote, then there would be no new Scottish \u00a31 coin if Scots opted for independence. \"The new coin would not be legal tender in Scotland and so would never come into circulation there,\" he explained.\n\nThe Royal Mint says the new \u00a31 coin will be the most secure in the world.

The Payments Council, the Automatic Vending Association, the British Retail Consortium and the British Parking Association all welcomed the announcement.\n\nHe said the new design was a \"fitting tribute\" to Britain's heritage, sharing the same shape as the old three pence coin, which was in circulation from 1937 until decimalisation in 1971. The old threepenny bit was the first to have the dodecagon shape, which enhanced its popularity during the Second World War as its distinctiveness made it the easiest coin to recognise during the air-raid blackouts.","383":"A new 12-sided one pound coin based on the threepenny bit is being unveiled - and is said to be the hardest in the world to fake.\n\nDescribed as a \"giant leap into the future\" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3% in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million.\n\nThe coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the 'Threepenny bit', which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nBut unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain an array of technological advances making it difficult to forge.\n\nAs well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing \u00a32 coin, the new \u00a31 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales.\n\nBudget 2014 - in pictures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16 show all Budget 2014 - in pictures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\/16 Budget 2014 George Osborne outside Downing Street with the famous red case (Picture: PA)\n\n2\/16 Budget 2014 George Osborne delivers his Budget statement to the House of Commons (Picture: PA)\n\n3\/16 Budget 2014 Osborne delivers his Budget statement (Picture: PA)\n\n4\/16 Budget 2014 Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls listens as Osborne delivers his Budget (Picture: PA)\n\n5\/16 Budget 2014 Prime Minister David Cameron speaks during Prime Minister's Questions ahead of the Budget (Picture: PA)\n\n6\/16 Budget 2014 The press awaits Osborne at Downing Street (Picture: PA)\n\n7\/16 Budget 2014 George Osborne and Danny Alexander with the Treasury team (Picture: Jeremy Selwyn) Jeremy Selwyn\n\n8\/16 Budget 2014 Osborne on his way to Parliament to deliver the Budget (Picture: PA)\n\n9\/16 Budget 2014 Osborne emerges from No 11 (Picture: PA)\n\n10\/16 Budget 2014 Sky News political editor Adam Boulton attempts a selfie\n\n11\/16 Budget 2014 Michael Gove arrives for Cabinet this morning (Picture: Jeremy Selwyn)\n\n12\/16 Budget 2014 Theresa May outside No10 (Picture: Jeremy Selwyn)\n\n13\/16 Budget 2014 William Hague heads into No10 (Picture: Jeremy Selwyn)\n\n14\/16 Budget 2014 Osborne and Danny Alexander prepares to lead members of the Treasury team out of 11 Downing Street (Picture: Getty)\n\n15\/16 Budget 2014 A Labour Party poster in response to George Osborne's Budget (Picture: Glenn Copus) GLENN COPUS\n\n16\/16 Budget 2014 George Osborne reveals a new one pound coin ahead of the Budget\n\nA Treasury spokesman said: \"After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current \u00a31 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.\n\n\"With advances in technology making high value coins like the \u00a31 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.\n\n\"We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic Threepenny bit.\"\n\nRoyal Mint chief executive Adam Lawrence hailed the \"exciting project\", adding: \"The current \u00a31 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.\n\n\"It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process.\n\n\"We're extremely proud that the proposal includes the Royal Mint's Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS) technology, offering greater currency security at a lower cost.\"\n\nAs with all coins, the Queen's effigy will be on the 'heads' side, but the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the design for the 'tails' side.\n\nA Bank of England spokesman added: \"Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the Bank's decision to produce polymer banknotes, this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency.\"\n\nNational Crime Agency counterfeiting expert John Sheridan said: \"The issuing of a new coin with enhanced security features will make it more difficult for criminals to copy as well as presenting increased opportunities for law enforcement to investigate and disrupt the producers and distributors of counterfeit currency.\"","384":"Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!
