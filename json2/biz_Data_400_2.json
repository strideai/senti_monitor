In the past two years, there has been strong support for the index around 78.60-79.00.\n\nThe Fed is widely expected to continue to reduce the size of its monthly bond purchase programme by $10 billion at the end of its two-day meeting later in the day, the first policy review since Yellen took the helm at the world's most powerful central bank.\n\nTraders are keenly focused on the Fed's forward guidance on policy, with many expecting the Fed to reassure markets that interest rate hikes are still a long way off despite the unemployment rate easing faster than expected.\n\nThe Fed previously said that it would not raise interest rates until joblessness fell to at least 6.5 percent, a pledge that policymakers thought would hold until at least mid-2015. But that rate hit a five-year low of 6.6 percent in January, before rising to 6.7 percent in February.\n\nExpectations that Yellen will pursue a broadly dovish stance have helped rein in U.S. Treasury yields, which in turn undermined the attraction of the dollar for bond investors.\n\n\"Many investors had probably expected the dollar to strengthen this year because the U.S. economy looked in better shape than others,\" said Katsunori Kitakura, associate general manager of market making at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.\n\n\"But their positioning has probably been damaged by the Ukraine crisis and poor economic data due to bad weather, and that's probably a reason for the dollar's struggles recently,\" he added.\n\nYEN, EURO\n\nThe yen held onto much of its recent gains. The dollar edged up 0.1 percent to about 101.58 yen, still not very far from a one-month low of 101.20 yen hit on March 3.\n\nA trader for a European bank in Tokyo said dollar bids and offers were mixed on the downside, adding that there were some stop-loss dollar offers around 101.00 yen.\n\nThe yen showed little reaction to data showing that Japan logged a larger-than-expected trade deficit in February.\n\nTensions in Ukraine remain a focal point, although investor anxiety has eased somewhat after Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that he did not plan to seize other regions of Ukraine, a day after Crimean citizens voted to be annexed by Moscow.\n\nThe euro fetched about $1.3921, down 0.1 percent on the day but not far from a peak of $1.3967 hit on Thursday, its highest level in 2-1\/2 years.\n\nAlthough the single currency was pitched by many banks at the start of 2014 as one of this year's likely losers, it has drawn strength from a recovery in the euro zone, the currency bloc's strong current account balance and an absence of fresh easing steps from the European Central Bank.\n\nThe single currency has also quickly pared its losses triggered on Tuesday by a sharp drop in Germany's ZEW survey of investor and analyst sentiment, which was due largely to the Ukraine crisis.\n\nThe Australian dollar briefly touched a three-month high of $0.9138, supported by a return of risk appetite. It later pared gains and was last down 0.1 percent at $0.9119.

The yen had suffered on Monday after Western powers took only minimal steps against Russia over its support for a separatist referendum in Crimea, easing concerns of a blowup in relations.\n\nThe euro continued to look strong despite a dip after a poor batch of trade and sentiment data which underlined uncertainty over Europe's immediate economic prospects.\n\nThe single currency has been another of this year's big surprises, confounding predictions of a slide against the dollar as the U.S. economy improves and much of Europe's lags behind.\n\nMuch of that stems from the European Central Bank's refusal to take - or at least signal the prospect of - more extreme action to pump more money into the economy.\n\nEuro zone trade and German ZEW sentiment data were not on balance expected to shake that view and the euro was just over 0.1 percent lower at $1.3910, still within sight of 2-1\/2 year highs reached last week and the big symbolic level of $1.40.\n\nThe yen gained almost 0.4 percent against the dollar to 101.41 in European trade with dealers still seeing headlines from Russia and Ukraine as an important driver. Any re-emergence of tensions would also support the Swiss franc.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin started delivering a speech to the Russian parliament just after 1100 GMT.\n\n\"We've seen some easing off of the relief rally we saw yesterday but it is going to stay at the top of the market's list of concerns,\" said Lee Hardman, strategist with Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi-UFJ in London.\n\n\"Right now we're in a kind of stalemate situation and generally we just need to see how it develops. Russia could clearly decide to take reciprocal action at some stage which might for example have knock-on effects for the euro zone.\"","34":"Good day.and welcome to Tuesday morning. I was somewhat surprised to see the markets in a relative calm yesterday given the back and forth over Ukraine and Crimea, along with the uncertainty surrounding strained relationships with Russia and the West but this has the making to be a long story. The equity markets had a solid day while the dollar spend the day lower against most currencies, so if you didn't know any better, it was business as usual. With that said, let's jump in and take a look.\n\nThe Empire manufacturing index for March got us started yesterday with a modest increase following the February disappointment. If we take a look at the individual components of the report, it was sort of a mixed bag as new orders and shipments increased while employment and delivery time decreased. Inclement weather still had a heavy hand in the New York region in the first part of March, but the reading of 5.61 was below the expected result of 6.50. This is the first of several regional manufacturing reports, but let's take a look at some national figures from last month.\n\nFebruary industrial production had a nice pop as it had the biggest gain in three months. Total industrial output, which includes utilities and mining, increased 0.6% as weather was more cooperative and carmakers rebounded from a rough January. Specifically looking at factory output, we saw the biggest increase since August last month as it came in at 0.8%. It didn't quite offset the revised 0.9% contraction in January, so we're still sitting on a negative number so far this year. If the other regional reports come in like the NY area, we should be back in black this month.\n\nThe experts were only anticipating a 0.3% gain so this report really hit a home run and provided solid support for the equity markets. Factory output excluding vehicles increased 0.5%, which was the most in four months, and economists now see manufacturing as being a positive contributor heading into summer. Assuming the inventory buildup from the beginning of the year continues to dwindle, I would think that helps the manufacturing numbers as well. I guess we'll see if the volatility of the first couple months will flatten out going forward as we should be past most of the mother nature related events.\n\nFollowing up with more good news, February capacity utilization both increased more than expected as well as compared to the previous month. Remember, this report measures the amount of a factory that's in use and the Fed generally uses it to gauge the amount of slack in the economy. The rise to 78.8% from 78.5% was a positive development and supports the other reports we had just discussed. We were supposed to get the TICS data yesterday, but that got pushed to this morning since some federal offices were closed due to weather.\n\nThe last bit of data yesterday came in the way of homebuilder confidence. The NAHB (National Association of Home Builders) Housing Market Index gave us a reading for March that was slightly above last month but below expectations. The result of 47 was both below initial estimates of 50 as well as the line in the sand that separates those who see good conditions compared to poor conditions. The measure of current sales increased a bit while the measure of sales expectations over the next six months fell so they still remain optimistic going forward.\n\nAnd that takes us to this morning, when we get February CPI, housing starts, and building permits. We aren't expecting any significant moves one way or the other, so I would say they get largely overlooked. The housing numbers might get some air time since they are expected to show some improvement, but other than that, it's a yawner. When we include the rollover of the TIC flows from January, we have today in data. As I mentioned up top, I think the markets were bracing for the worst regarding Ukraine and Russia so relief set in, for now at least, when things didn't escalate.\n\nThe geopolitical tensions eased a bit when we didn't see any major violence following the Crimean vote to join Russia in a landslide margin, so the risk takers felt comfortable enough to get back in the pool. The EU and US have implemented some sanctions, which are really symbolic in nature at this point and lack any real teeth, but it's at least something to talk about. The measure included freezing assets and banning travel on several officials that are believed to be involved with that movement. President Obama said they will calibrate responses according to whether Russia escalates or de-escalates the situation. If we continue seeing this modest and specific action, I think the markets are ok with it at this point.\n\nAs a result of the risk on sentiment, the dollar ended the day lower against most currencies. I saw a report from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that showed investors reduced bullish bets on the US dollar for a fifth straight week while the net long positions fell to their lowest levels in over four months. That data would certainly be consistent with the euro trading at 1.39. Speaking of the euro, it traded in a pretty tight range yesterday in spite of lower inflation data. In fact, eurozone inflation unexpectedly fell in February to 0.7% from 0.8% and represents the fifth month below 1%.\n\nWhile this report on its own probably isn't enough to cause the ECB to cut rates again, it has increased its possibility. The last time inflation fell to this level, the ECB did end up surprising the markets with a rate cut, but most economists only see a significant rise in the euro or an abrupt decline in growth to push the ECB into action, assuming inflation doesn't continue falling. Deflation remains on the ECB's radar screen so they will continue to monitor and assess. I know that I'm throwing this one in from left field, but thought it was interesting when I saw the German current account surplus has been at least 6% since 2007.\n\nAnyway, the Australian dollar had top honors yesterday as it appreciated nearly 0.7%. The springboard for the Aussie came in the way of Westpac Bank Corp dropping their call for a rate cut this year. Bill Evans, their chief economist, said public comments from central bank officials indicated a high hurdle for further rate cuts and the better outlook for jobs and consumers have made the hurdle too high. He went on to say rates should stay on hold this year and thinks the first rate hike would come in the third quarter of next year. There are still a contingent of those who see another rate cut, but last week's jobs report supports Evans.\n\nThe Swedish krona, which finished in second place, was nipping at the ankles of the Aussie, but we didn't have any data to initiate the move so it looks to be the risk on trade at work. The Canadian dollar put in a solid day by rising about 0.5% as housing data saw some improvement. Home sales last month increased 0.3% and the average home price also moved in the right direction as historically low interest rates are helping the cause. The central bank governor is supposed to speak today so we'll see if he takes that as an opportunity to express his pleasure with a lower loonie.\n\nThe Chinese renminbi was actually one of the worst performing currencies as it fell nearly 0.5% after the PBOC widened its daily trading bank to 2%. While the markets view this as a positive long term development, they felt compelled to mark the currency lower on recent domestic data that has slowed. Again, I would say 7.5% economic growth isn't what you would call slow, but its lower than what it has been in the past so that what the markets are focusing on right now. Gold had a tough day as the global tensions eased and profit taking soon followed as it ended the day down about $15.\n\nAs I came in this morning, the dollar is up slightly against most currencies after Putin said he supported the request from Crimea to join Russia in the face of sanctions imposed by the US and Europe. The markets seem a little more anxious so far this morning so both the Japanese yen and Swiss franc have pulled ahead in the currency returns chart. Putin is supposed to speak very soon, so we'll see if he gives any indication if he plans to stand his ground or if he decides to back off a bit.\n\nFor What It's Worth. According to a story in Reuters, New York scored 786 points in the Global Financial Centers Index to edge out London, which scored 784. The index is compiled by Z\/Yen, a consultancy based in London. \"London sees the largest fall in the top 50 centers,\" said Mark Yeandle, associate director of Z\/Yen. \"This seems to be based on a number of factors including uncertainty over Europe, the perception that London might be becoming less welcoming to foreigners, and perceived levels of market manipulation.\"\n\nTo recap.The markets were expecting the worst in Ukraine but was pleasantly surprised to see that nothing violent or drastic has unfolded so far. The manufacturing reports from yesterday all showed improvement while capacity utilization was on the rise. Homebuilder confidence remained muted but did rise a bit from the previous month. We don't have any truly meaningful data out today so we should see focus shift to the Fed. The dollar ended the day lower and euro inflation came in lower than expected. The Aussie took the top spot as calls for rate cuts are becoming fewer. Housing in Canada showed improvement and the Chinese renminbi was one of the worst performing currencies yesterday\n\nCurrencies today 3\/18\/14.

With the U.S. and European Union imposing travel and financial sanctions on key Russian and Ukrainian officials today, the ball is now in Russia's court. The world is watching to see how Russia will respond to the new sanctions, which are limited to only 21 individuals. The euro is trading higher because these restrictions do not apply to Putin, members of his family or key economic or banking officials, but it is wishful thinking to believe that he will buckle under the pressure of these weak measures. Of course this is only the international community's first response to Russia's violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. If Russia fails to de-escalate the tensions like President Obama hopes, more severe sanctions imposed on a longer list of individuals are sure to follow. Russia has already threatened to retaliate and it could be a matter of hours or days before they impose their own restrictions that could include limits on business activity of major U.S. companies such as ExxonMobil, Boeing, Ford and PepsiCo.\n\nThe big question now is whether this will remain a war of words or turn into a larger military conflict between Russia and Ukraine that requires a deeper involvement by the West. We know the world does not recognize the legitimacy of the Crimea referendum and the Ukrainian government has approved an emergency measure to activate their 40k military reserves in case Russia makes a deeper incursion. If Russia's interest is limited to Crimea and the world accepts that it has fallen under their control, then the sanctions that we have seen so far could be the worst of it. However if Russia who has argued that Kiev is not a legitimate government decides to make a deeper foray into Ukraine to \"protect all Russian-speaking people,\" then the world will have to decide if they will take more aggressive measures such as extending full NATO membership to Ukraine. Russia is vehemently opposed to Ukraine NATO membership - in 2008, they threatened to point nuclear missiles at Ukraine if they joined the alliance. By extending an invitation to Ukraine, NATO would be effectively telling Russia they are prepared to defend the country from further advances but this comes with its own risk of reigniting the Cold War and significantly degrading Russian-U.S., and Russian-European relations. The bottom line is that it is very difficult to be optimistic under these circumstances because of the material risk that the crisis in the Ukraine will deepen and for this reason we eye the rally today in the EUR\/USD and other major currency pairs with extreme caution.\n\nDollar: Pre-FOMC Data Not a Major Threat\n\nThere was very little consistency in the performance of the greenback today, which should not be surprising considering that we do not expect any big moves in the dollar ahead of Wednesday's Federal Reserve monetary policy decision. A number of U.S. economic reports were released today and a few additional releases are scheduled for tomorrow but none of these reports are significant enough to alter the central bank's monetary policy plans. Today's economic reports provided further evidence of a slow but steady recovery in the U.S. economy. Economists had been hoping for a larger rise in the Empire State manufacturing and NAHB housing market indices but the reports fell short of expectations. Nonetheless they improved from the previous month and when combined with the uptick in industrial and manufacturing production, provided very little threat to the U.S. dollar. As long as these reports do not show a significant deterioration in economic activity, there is very little reason for the Fed to change its pace of tapering. The same is true for Tuesday's inflation and housing market reports. CPI is expected to remain low and housing market activity should rebound in February after falling sharply in January. The greenback traded higher against the Japanese Yen today thanks to the rebound in U.S. yields and rally in equities. Since we expect yields to continue ticking upwards ahead of the FOMC rate decision, we are also looking for a further recovery in USD\/JPY. Of course, USD\/JPY is very sensitive to risk appetite and the Ukraine crisis so the currency pair could completely ignore yields and head lower if the Russia decides to invade Ukraine.\n\nAUD: Unfazed by China's Decision to Double CNY Trading Band\n\nThe Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars traded sharply higher against the greenback today despite a big announcement from China over the weekend. On Saturday, China doubled its Yuan trading band. They will now allow the CNY to fluctuate 2% above or below its daily midpoint rate, up from 1%. Given the currency's recent rapid decent, this decision was not a complete surprise and had only a limited impact on major currencies but it represents a major shift in FX policy for the central bank. The PBoC is clearly using the exchange rate as a means to increase stimulus and provide additional support to its economy as growth slows. With exports falling by the largest amount in more than 4 years during the month of February, the economy could certainly use the support of a weaker currency, which helps to make the cost of Chinese imports more competitive. Although the central bank argues that today's move is a step towards increasing exchange rate flexibility and greater two-way volatility in the currency, in the context of falling exports the recent slide in the Yuan clearly reflects an attempt to support the economy. A weaker Yuan hurts countries like Australia and Japan who rely heavily on Chinese demand. However even though trade balances could suffer, the AUD and JPY have taken the band winding in stride. Economic from the commodity producing countries were mixed with New Zealand service activity slowing but consumer confidence rising. In Canada, existing home sales rebounded after falling sharply the previous month and international securities transactions increased, providing support to the loonie. We'll keep an eye on Asia as no major economic reports are scheduled for release from these countries over the next 24 hours.\n\nGBP: More M&A Flow\n\nCompared to some of the other major currencies, there was very little movement in the British pound. UK Rightmove's house price report was the only piece of U.K. data released today and it showed that house prices grew at a slower pace in the month of March. Do not be mistaken however the U.K. housing market remains strong. Prices in London hit a record high this month and across the nation, the 1.6% rise also left national values at all time highs. The Help to Buy scheme rolled out last year has proven to be a huge success in preventing a deep slide in housing market activity. EUR\/GBP continued to trickle higher on the back of Vodafone's deal to acquire Spanish Cable Operator ONO for $10 billion. This is Vodafone's first major acquisition since selling its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless for $130 billion. Flush with cash, they have a now have a significant amount of capital to spend on acquisitions so we can assume that this won't be the last sterling negative M&A flow by Vodafone this year. EUR\/GBP has been trading extremely well but whether gains can be sustained will largely depend on Wednesday's Bank of England minutes and employment report.\n\nJPY: Japanese Government Sees Evidence of Rising Domestic Demand\n\nA sharp improvement in risk appetite drove the Japanese Yen lower against all of the major currencies. No economic data was released from Japan overnight but the Cabinet provided its latest economic assessment. In addition to repeating last month's view that the economy is recovering at a moderate pace, they also said \"a last minute rise in demand before a consumption tax increase is intensifying.\" This suggests they see evidence of increased consumer consumption, which we haven't seen much sign of in recent economic reports. However economists are looking for a significant improvement in the trade balance on Wednesday and this may be due in part to higher domestic demand. There are several Bank of Japan officials speaking this week including Governor Kuroda but based on the latest central bank meeting, policymakers do not feel that there is any immediate need for more stimulus. In the meantime we expect USD\/JPY and the other Yen crosses to take its cue from risk appetite.","59":"Ooops...

Foreign exchange investors have nerves of steel today, bidding up euro on the official announcement of sanctions on Russian politicians by the U.S. and EU. The U.S. announced plans to freeze the assets of 11 key Russian and Ukrainian officials and the EU will impose sanctions on 21 members of the Ukrainian and Russian government involved in Moscow\u2019s incursion into Crimea. The euro is responding well to these initial measures because they are limited to a small group but today\u2019s announcements represent the international community\u2019s very first response to Russia\u2019s violation of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity. If Russian troops move into Ukraine, more severe and widespread sanctions are sure to follow. There is very little chance that Russia will bat an eye at these sections. In fact, Putin has threatened his own restrictions, which could be announced in the coming hours or days. So while risk appetite has improved today, under these circumstances, it will be very difficult for the optimism to be sustained because there is a high risk of the crisis in the Ukraine deepening. However, until Russia retaliates investors are buying euros on the relief that the initial sanctions are mild and the currency could aim for fresh 2-year highs.\n\nThe aftermath of the referendum in Crimea this weekend is not the only big story in the foreign exchange market.

In a speech snappily titled \u2018One Mission. One Bank. Promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom\u2019, the BoE governor set out 15 initiatives to \u2018reshape the institution\u2019.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s tradition that the Bank of England governor delivers one of Cass Business School\u2019s annual Mais lectures: Mervyn King did it in 2005, Edward George did it in 1998 and Robin Leigh-Pemberton did it in 1987.\n\n\n\nBeyond the business school jargon, some of what Carney said was actually pretty sensible: by removing \u2018silos\u2019 and making separate factions of the bank work together more closely, he argued that the Bank will be better positioned to spot incoming storms. Or, as Carney put it, \u2018the broad range of responsibilities we have been given creates the potential to exploit the complementarities and synergies between them\u2019. He\u2019s obviously using a different dictionary to MT\u2019s\u2026\n\n\n\nOther changes include hiring in outsiders - ex-Goldman Sachser Ben Broadbent and Nemat \u2018Minouche\u2019 Shafik will start their jobs as deputy governors in July and August respectively. Shafik has the unenviable task of kicking off the Bank of England\u2019s answer to the US Federal Reserve\u2019s tapering.\n\n\n\n\u2018It doesn\u2019t take a genius\u2019 to see risks exist today that are similar to the various bubbles that inflated before the 2008 crisis, he added.\n\n\n\n\u2018That tension between monetary and financial stability is best managed in a co-ordinated way in a single institution.\u2019\n\n\n\nCan bringing in a few outsiders and improving communications between \u2018silos\u2019 really prevent another crisis? There\u2019s an argument that with a property bubble and a long period of unusually low interest rates (not to mention ever-inflating bank bonuses), we haven\u2019t learned much from the financial crisis. But Carney insisted the Bank had the \u2018tools\u2019 to manage it.\n\n\n\n\u2018The Financial Policy Committee has identified a graduated range of macroprudential tools available to it for a coherent, proportionate response to these risks, and has taken initial, prudent steps,\u2019 he said.\n\n\n\nThe trouble is that the Bank had similar tools back in 2008, but the global banking industry - along with policymakers and commentators - had their heads in the sand to such an extent that it didn\u2019t spot anything coming. It\u2019s that attitude Carney is trying to prevent, but it\u2019s unlikely these measures would have done much to prevent the crisis last time around, such was the collective ego-stroking going on.\n\n\n\nStill: all this unity puts MT in mind of a certain early noughties hit.

However, the MPC was not concerned about a direct fallout of the Ukraine crisis on the British economy except for risks stemming from a \u201cgeneral rise in risk premia and via commodity markets\u201d because the \u201cdirect trade and financial linkages between the United Kingdom and Ukraine were limited.\u201d\n\nEmerging markets too had stabilized after the volatile conditions of the previous month, the MPC noted, adding that there had been mixed developments in the international economy.\n\n\u201cThe easing of tensions in some emerging economies had been accompanied by signs of further modest recovery in the euro area.

Among the changes, the Bank of England will get a new chairman of Court, its equivalent of a management board.\n\nPreviously the Bank and the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) had a specific mandate to focus on the 2% Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation rate, but now it has a much wider role following the overhaul of the regulation of financial services.\n\nCarney criticised the danger of such a narrow focus on the inflation rate yesterday. \u201cWith time, a healthy focus became a dangerous distraction,\u201d he said.\n\nHe went on to warn the UK now faces fresh dangers from excessive borrowing, in part caused by the current era of low rates which were cut dramatically by the previous governor to stave off a crippling depression.\n\nCarney reportedly said low interest rates meant the UK was facing \u201csimilar risks\u201d to those behind the crisis that emerged in 2008 \u2013 as households and businesses feel encouraged to borrow to excess.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a genius to see that similar risks exist today,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Bank now has a wider role to play in financial stability following the shake-up in the wake of the credit crisis, and Carney hinted there may be other ways to tackle the risks building up rather than relying on interest rate rises.\n\nHe said new \u201cmacroprudential\u201d powers held by the Bank \u2013 which include making sure banks have adequate levels of capital and tools to cool down an overheating housing market \u2013 could help, rather than using an aggressive interest rate policy which can have unforeseen consequences.\n\n\u201cThat in turn may reduce the need for sharp or persistent moves in interest rates, which themselves might threaten financial stability,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAlthough monetary policy has an important role to play in mitigating financial stability risks, it does so only as a last line of defence.\u201d","80":"The item that you have requested was not found.\n\nPossible causes:\n\nThe address was entered incorrectly\n\nThe item no longer exists\n\nThere has been an error on the site\n\nIf you feel the address you entered is correct you can contact us, mentioning the error message received and the item you were trying to reach.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience.

It came hours after the announcement of three new high-ranking appointments at Threadneedle Street.Mr Carney's reforms consolidate new responsibilities for regulation and stability given to the Bank in the wake of the financial crisis in addition to its role in setting interest rates and keeping a lid on inflation.The governor admitted that low rates before the crash contributed to the risk-taking posing dangers to the economy, adding: \"It doesn't take a genius to see that similar risks exist today.\"But he said that new \"macroprudential\" powers held by the Bank - which include making sure banks have adequate levels of capital and tools to cool down an overheating housing market - could help.They would reduce the need for interest rate policy to be \"diverted\" towards dampening excessive borrowing.\"That in turn may reduce the need for sharp or persistent moves in interest rates, which themselves might threaten financial stability,\" he said.\"Although monetary policy has an important role to play in mitigating financial stability risks, it does so only as a last line of defence.\"He signalled frustration over a previous concentration purely on the inflation target, saying: \"With time, a healthy focus became a dangerous distraction.\"Mr Carney said the widening of the Bank's responsibilities was a welcome return to its \"broad role\" of the past - citing the \"judicious exercise of the governor's eyebrows\" historically to manage and resolve financial crises.But he added: \"The age of informal responsibilities, nods winks, secrecy and instinct is long past.\"Instead, a series of new positions and directorates are to be set up at Threadneedle Street would formalise the positionPolicy makers have said that any rise in interest rates from their current historic low of 0.5% will be limited and gradual.But Mr Carney said they were \"fully aware that an environment of relatively low and predictable interest rates could encourage excessive risk-taking in financial markets and by households\".He said the previous reduced view of the Bank's functions had been \"fatally flawed\", failing to recognise that financial stability was as important as price stability, as he unveiled his new \"One Bank\" plan to be rolled out over three years.It will undertake 15 initiatives, with a key aim of maximising the effectiveness of the Bank's work by breaking down barriers between separate areas of its work.Mr Carney said the plan also \"sweeps away a proliferation of internal committees that held up decision making\".The Bank will adopt a new mission statement: \"Promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability.\"It said the motto embodied the public service mission of the institution that had been in place since its original 1694 charter.\"In short, we are creating a central bank for the 21st century that combines the finest aspects of our history and traditions with the best of the modern and new,\" Mr Carney said.The reforms include the creation of a new independent evaluation unit to support the Bank's oversight committee - beefing up its self-policing in the wake of damaging allegations that some officials knew about attempts to rig foreign exchange rates.In a shift towards greater transparency, Mr Carney also said the Bank would publish the results of regular bank stress tests, as well as more of the research and analysis underlying policy choices.Earlier today, the Bank announced the appointment of Dr Nemat Shafik to take on the newly-created role of deputy governor responsible for markets and banking.Dr \"Minouche\" Shafik will join on August 1 with a priority to conduct a root-and-branch review of how the Bank monitors markets following the forex allegations.Meanwhile, Ben Broadbent, already a member of the nine-strong rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, was named as successor to Charlie Bean, the outgoing deputy governor for monetary policy.Anthony Habgood, chairman of Costa Coffee and Premier Inn group Whitbread, will become chairman of the court of the Bank of England as part of a raft of appointments.Mr Carney did not respond directly to a question about whether the recent decision by the Government to extend its Help to Buy policy to support the housing market was sensible - given his warnings over excess borrowing.But he stressed that the Bank stood ready to build on measures it has already taken to try to take some of the heat out of the sector.In November, it scrapped the household mortgage element of the flagship Funding for Lending initiative that encourages borrowing, amid fears of a property bubble.The Bank's Financial Policy Committee also announced a new power to be able to vary the affordability criteria that borrowers must meet to ensure they can afford to service mortgages if interest rates rise, and has set out further powers it could use.Mr Carney said today: \"We have taken measures in the past if necessary.

Even so, there remained some way to go to ensure that the recovery was both balance and sustainable,\" the minutes said.\n\nSterling strengthened by 1.5 percent in the month running up to the March MPC meeting, hitting its highest in several years, though it has since weakened to its lowest against the euro since the start of 2014.\n\nThe BoE said that its market contacts suggested that this was due to Britain's improved growth outlook compared to other countries, as well as tensions between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nOverall it said the market impact of the Ukraine tensions was smaller than might have been expected, but it said sterling could strengthen further if Britain's growth prospects improved or those elsewhere in the world weakened.\n\nStronger sterling would tend to reduce inflation in Britain, it added, but the scale of the impact was hard to judge as the MPC expected companies to use some of the lower cost of imports to increase profit margins.\n\nSome MPC members have expressed greater concern about sterling's impact on exports in separate public comments.\n\nDeputy governor Charlie Bean said last week that the BoE could keep interest rates lower for longer if sterling strengthens much more, adding that its current level was \"fine\". (Full Story)\n\nAnd Monetary Policy Committee member Ian McCafferty said in an interview with Reuters last month that further strength in sterling would be a worry. (Full Story)\n\nThe MPC were also unsure on how much scope Britain's economy had to grow without generating inflation. Unemployment rose in the fourth quarter of 2013 and much of the gain in employment had been in the self-employment sector - suggesting there could be more untapped capacity.\n\nBut many young people who gained jobs were in low-productivity jobs, reducing the apparent degree of capacity in the labour market.\n\n\"Members of the committee attached different weights to the pieces of evidence regarding the degree of spare capacity in the labour market,\" the minutes said.\n\nThe minutes noted no other differences among the MPC members, who voted unanimously to keep interest rates at a record low 0.5 percent.\n\nFinancial markets have pointed to spring 2015 as a potential time for the first rate hike.\n\nOutput is still just below its peak in the first quarter of 2008 - a much weaker recovery from the financial crisis than in most other big advanced economies. The BoE is concerned that low productivity may limit Britain's ability to catch up without generating higher inflation in the medium term.","86":"Ooops!

Broadbent will now be responsible for the Bank\u2019s analysis of the state of the UK economy.\n\n\n\nThe second new governor is the IMF\u2019s Nemat Shafik, who will take a newly-created deputy governor role to oversee markets and banking. She will replace executive director for markets Paul Fisher from 1 August.

The reshuffle, which comes eight months into Carney's term as governor, was set out in a speech at Cass Business School last night. Carney told the audience he was introducing fifteen initiatives in total to improve the Bank\u2019s structure.\n\n\n\n\"These appointments result in a well-rounded senior management team at the Bank - one that will set the direction for an ambitious agenda of transformation,\" said Carney.\n\n\n\nThe reorganisation has generally been welcomed for bringing together internal teams and structres. Iain Coke, head of ICAEW\u2019s Financial Services Faculty, said, \u201cThe Financial Services Act 2012, which restructured the UK regulatory system, created a cumbersome design for the Bank of England, with the Prudential Regulation Authority being set up as a separate subsidiary in a different building and the Monetary and Financial Policy Committees each being independent. Operationally, the Bank was also quite separated. Co-ordination between these arms was always going to be difficult.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis reorganisation dismantles some of the clunkier parts of 2012 reforms to create a less fragmented system. In many ways it should make the Bank easier to manage, though by increasing the number of deputy governors and executive directors and introducing a matrix management structure with joint reporting lines, it may create its own tensions. The reforms also potentially increase the effective power of the governor and executives over the Bank\u2019s activities.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile the Court was strengthened by creating its oversight committee, it still has a weaker role than corporate boards. One of the tasks for the new chairman of the Court of the Bank should be to consider how to strengthen governance at the Bank alongside this operational restructuring.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe reorganisation at the Bank comes alongside the announcement that a new \u00a31 coin will be introduced, amid concerns over the existing coin is too vulnerable to counterfeiting. The Royal Mint believes 3% of the existing \u00a31 coins in circulation are fake, around 45 million coins in total.\n\n\n\nThe new coin is based on the design of the old three penny coin, which had twelve sides and was in circulation between 1937 and 1971.\n\nHelen Roxburgh\n\nRelated articles\n\nCarney pledges to hold interest rates down\n\nCarney calls for shake-up\n\nSir Jon Cunliffe appointed as Bank deputy\n\nWhere Mark Carney should start","102":"Mark Carney has argued that the modern view of central banking\u2019s role in the economy has become \u201cfatally flawed\u201d as he works to take the Bank of England back to its roots.\n\nSpeaking at Cass Business School last night, the BoE governor said central banks\u2019 modern-day focus on inflation targeting has become a \u201cdangerous distraction\u201d and highlighted the need for them to safeguard financial stability as well.\n\nThe Bank was founded in 1694 with the aim of promoting the public good for the people of the UK and by the end of the 19th century its role has grown to see it hold informal responsibilities in a number of areas.\n\nHowever, Carney noted that this changed in 1997 when the modern BoE was created \u201cwith a narrower focus on price stability grounded in clear statutory objectives, and with the operational independence to pursue them\u201d.\n\nThe governor added: \u201cThose changes reflected the belief that price stability was the best contribution a central bank could make to macroeconomic stability and by extension to the broader public good.

Mr Haldane, who currently serves as the Bank's executive director for financial stability, will take on the role of chief economist in the summer and join the Monetary Policy Committee. If history is anything to go by, there could be some testy clashes between Mr Haldane and Governor Mark Carney. Two years ago, Mr Carney accused Mr Haldane of not understanding the facts following proposals he made to simplify bank regulation and encourage banks to break up. Mr Haldane argued that the Basel III rules on banking Mr Carney has championed were so complex they would inevitably fail. Instead, he called for simple reforms, smaller banks and more straightforward but stronger rules. However, Mr Carney later hit back in an interview, saying: \"I thought Andrew Haldane's speech was uneven... Basel I was simple and it drove us off a cliff.

However, he failed to follow in his predecessor's footsteps for a second time, losing out to Sir Jon Cunliffe, a former Treasury mandarin, for the deputy governor job. Mr Fisher has also come under scrutiny after it emerged that a Bank employee had been sacked amid allegations that the central bank was involved in the rigging of the foreign exchange market. At a Treasury select committee hearing last week, he denied claims the Old Lady was warned about foreign exchange rate fixing in 2006, but agreed he could \"see why people might think that from the minutes\".\n\nBen Broadbent is a former Goldman Sachs economist and Treasury adviser. The new deputy governor for monetary policy joined the MPC as an external member in 2011. He gained a firstclass honours degree from Cambridge and studied for a PhD at Harvard. During his time at Goldman, Mr Broadbent researched and wrote extensively on the UK economy and monetary policy. Last month he warned that Britain's economic productivity may fail to match America's because of the ongoing crisis in the eurozone and this could create inflation pressures. Mr Broadbent has also advised against breaking up banks, arguing that large lenders should be structured in a way that allows them to fail without needing support from the taxpayer.\n\nSpencer Dale is swapping places with Andy Haldane to become executive director for financial stability strategy and risk. He will also join the Financial Policy Committee, which is responsible for ensuring financial stability. Mr Dale was educated at the University of Wales, gaining a BSc in economics.

Asked about the glass ceiling, Dr Shafik, who has ten-year-old twins, said the metaphor is \u2018not a good one\u2019.\n\nAt just 35 she became the youngest-ever vice president of the World Bank, and most recently worked as deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund\n\nIn an interview in 2009, she said: \u2018I know the concept of it is that it is supposed to mean that there is an invisible barrier. But it also implies that, if you could break through it, then everybody could get through and it is not quite that simple. In my experience it is more like a sticky door.\n\n\u2018In order to get through it, you have to give it a nudge because it won\u2019t open automatically.

The Bank is literally stuffed with them now.\n\n\n\nGoldman Sachs connection: Chairman and chief executive Lloyd Blankfein, a great survivor of the pre-crisis era, now has alumni at three of the most important central banks in the world\n\nThe newest arrival is Nemat Shafik, an Egyptian-born Briton who is being brought in from the International Monetary Fund to be deputy governor for banking and markets.\n\n\n\nBoth the Libor and now the forex scandals have demonstrated that these are not areas where the Bank has distinguished itself in the recent past.\n\nShe joins Charlotte Hogg, the Bank\u2019s chief operating officer, as a second woman at the pinnacle of power in the City. The other new appointment is Ben Broadbent who takes over from Charlie Bean who is retiring.\n\n\n\nDespite impeccable academic credentials the choice will raise some eyebrows at Westminster because of the Goldman Sachs connection. All the arrivals, including the new head of the Court Anthony Habgood, have elitist CVs that most people can only aspire to.\n\n\n\nGoldman Sachs chairman and chief executive Lloyd Blankfein, a great survivor of the pre-crisis era, now has alumni at three of the most important central banks in the world.\n\nThe Bank has a former Goldman executive as governor and a former chief economist in Broadbent as deputy governor. It was often said that the main obstacle to Jim O\u2019Neill, the former head of asset management at Goldman, becoming governor was the investment banking connection. How wrong you can be.\n\n\n\nJust to underline the reach of Goldman its alumni include the current head of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi and the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bill Dudley.\n\n\n\nThe fact that all roads lead back to Goldman, despite the fines it paid post-crisis over Abacus mortgage backed securities scandal and its alleged role in disguising the levels of Greek government debt, does show a lack of imagination in the chanceries of the world.\n\n\n\nSuch a network of influence makes the Old Etonians\u2019 network among the UK\u2019s top people look modest. Aside from the new arrivals, the younger members of the old guard are to have their skill sets tested.\n\n\n\nSpencer Dale, the economist who was close to the former governor Lord King, moves into financial stability. He swaps jobs with Andy Haldane, one of the most out-of-the-box thinkers at the Bank.\n\n\n\nPaul Fisher, who executed much of quantitative easing (for better or worse) moves in to prudential regulation. By moving up-and-coming stars out of silos, Carney is seeking to create more all-round policymakers. That is sensible enough.\n\n\n\nHowever, one cannot help feeling that the post-crisis Bank might be a little too powerful and has moved too far from being the elegant monetary institution that was fashioned after independence in 1997.\n\nLast hurrah\n\n\n\nThe growth momentum at J Sainsbury (which I hold) was bound to slow down soon in one of the most competitive grocery markets in the world. And departing chief executive Justin King acknowledges that some adjustments on the tiller may be necessary before he heads off into the sunset in the summer.\n\n\n\nClearly the 3.1 per cent sales drop is not ideal but Sainsbury\u2019s can at least claim to be in parts of the market that consumers want. Sales out of convenience stores are climbing sharply, online is progressing and King is also optimistic about the company\u2019s non-food offer from clothing to domestic wares. So what about grocery?\n\nKing takes the view that the so-called price war is more of a fiction than is claimed. The discounters have less of the market now than a couple of decades ago.\n\nDespite all the noise, most of the price cutting is confined to milk and a few narrow ranges and the trust in Sainsbury\u2019s quality, seen during the horse meat scandal a year ago, is a point of difference. There is still time for King to show he is at the races before he bails out in June.\n\n\n\nBreaking good\n\n\n\nThe ONS has struggled for some time to report the output of Britain\u2019s creative industries in which the UK is a world leader.

The Bank of England he inherited was in urgent need of a shake-up, and he has now delivered on the comprehensive reorganisation he promised. Some of the jargon that accompanied his presentation yesterday was a tad irritating, but it is good to see private sector management techniques being applied to the public sector.\n\nCarney\u2019s appointment of Nemat Shafik as a deputy governor was another good move: he is hiring outsiders into senior positions, something that should have happened a long time ago.\n\nWhile Carney himself has private sector experience (he\u2019s ex-Goldman Sachs, as is Ben Broadbent, another new deputy governor), that remains unusual; let us hope that some of the next recruits will be ex-financial practitioners, rather than just regulators or economists. That remains one dangerous area of weakness in Carney\u2019s revamped Bank: theoretical knowledge is no substitute for hands-on experience.\n\nThe Bank of England is the one organisation that was genuinely rewarded for failure: it played a key role in fuelling the bubble by keeping interest rates too low and allowing liquidity and the supply of money to grow too quickly, a giant intellectual error caused by a flawed understanding of the economy and inadequate models. It failed to understand risk, lost touch with the marketplace, became too academic and insular, didn\u2019t listen to outsiders, was fully signed up to global regulatory agreements \u2013 such as Basel \u2013 that exacerbated the crisis and most recently mishandled the forex scandal. In return, it was given more powers and more staff. The FSA, by contrast, was abolished for its own incompetence and failure. It is good news, therefore, that Carney is seeking to make a break with the past.\n\nBut will he succeed? He thinks his new tools and structure would have allowed the Bank to prevent the crisis had they been in place in the mid-2000s. I doubt that very much: the global establishment had gone mad and lost touch with reality at the time, so it is unlikely that the Old Lady (even under Carney\u2019s \u201cOne Bank\u201d blueprint) would have behaved any differently to the Federal Reserve or any other of the failed central banks. It is true, of course, that Canada \u2013 which uses many of the tools Carney is transposing to the UK \u2013 escaped the crisis \u2013 but its finance sector is very different. Canadian house prices have also reached dangerously high levels, and the ratio of household debt to income has reached a record high of 163.7 per cent, which is not exactly healthy.\n\nCarney is right to warn that risks are building again, though he remains too complacent about housing and too dovish about the rate at which interest rates are likely to have to rise. Sorting the Bank\u2019s corporate governance is a vital step \u2013 but it won\u2019t on its own be enough to prevent a catastrophe.\n\nOSBORNE\u2019S BIG DAY\n\nHAS George Osborne got something up his sleeve? Or is he really going to deliver the most boring of Budget speeches? We will soon find out. For those of us who have been urging him to be bolder and more radical, especially when it comes to tax cuts, disappointment is almost guaranteed. But any change to stamp duty, that most absurd of taxes, would be welcome; and the chancellor might feel able to accelerate some of his other changes, perhaps even on corporation tax.\n\nThe markets will be watching the latest forecasts for the budget deficit \u2013 which hasn\u2019t been coming down as fast as the economy has been recovering \u2013 and scrutinising the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s predictions to see whether it still expects a rebound in corporate capex.\n\nIt may well be that the chancellor is seeking to make the economic recovery the centrepiece of his Budget \u2013 but I do hope he has been holding back at least one proper supply-side policy to cheer us all up.\n\nallister.heath@cityam.com\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @allisterheath\n\n","120":"Tim Wallace\n\nMORE than a dozen top staff at the Bank of England will be reshuffled into new or radically changed jobs this summer, the Bank said yesterday, with around 10 more senior positions still to be filled.\n\nA new deputy governor has been appointed for markets and banking, a position which did not exist previously and comes with a seat on the monetary policy committee (MPC).\n\nThe IMF\u2019s Nemat Shafik is taking the role, taking Paul Fisher\u2019s MPC seat.\n\nHe moves from being executive director for markets to deputy head of the prudential regulation authority (PRA).\n\nMeanwhile chief economist Spencer Dale is swapping jobs with financial stability boss Andy Haldane.\n\nHaldane will join the MPC and Dale the financial policy committee (FPC).\n\nRetiring deputy governor for monetary policy Charlie Bean will be replaced by external MPC member and Goldman Sachs alumnus Ben Broadbent.

He said the financial crisis was a \u0093powerful reminder\u0094 that to maintain economic stability the Bank had to do more than just fight inflation.\n\nTo do that Mr Carney has set out fifteen initiatives to reshape the Bank.

She also led the efforts to integrate the Fund's work on capacity building and technical assistance.\n\nShafik's resignation takes effect immediately, but she will stay on until mid-June as Special Advisor to the Managing Director.\n\nShafik joined the Fund as Deputy Managing Director in April 2011 after resigning her position as Permanent Secretary of the UK Department for International Development. She has also served as the youngest ever Vice President at the World Bank.\n\nA search for Shafik's successor will begin immediately. In making the selection, the Managing Director consults with the Executive Board regarding the type of qualifications that the candidates should possess. The appointment requires approval of the Fund's Executive Board.","129":"The Bank of England appointed not one, but two new deputy governors on Tuesday. The first \u2013 Nemat Shafik \u2013 is the first female deputy to join the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) since Rachel Lomax was appointed in 2003. The second \u2013 Ben Broadbent \u2013 joined the MPC in 2011 and will take charge of monetary policy when Charlie Bean retires in June. However, it was the rest of the Bank's game of musical chairs that took everyone by surprise.\n\nOn the face of it, Governor Mark Carney's speech on transforming the Bank looked like something ripped out of a political manifesto. \"One Mission. One Bank. Promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom,\" was the title. But beyond the cheesy strapline, something more fundamental is going on. At its heart is a simple goal: how does the Bank \u2013 which was given unprecedented powers last year when the Financial Services Authority was wound down \u2013 use the tools it has to protect the economy from future financial shocks without disrupting its existing functions?\n\nCarney's vision for the Bank was clear even before he joined last August. In February 2013, Carney called for \"a clear, shared vision for the Bank\" that would use \"synergies from the collection of policy functions\" and ensure an \"expanded senior management team melded into a cohesive unit\".\n\nOn Tuesday, the first phase of \"One Bank\" was unveiled. Carney reminded everyone that concentrating too much on inflation could become a \"dangerous distraction\" and that the Bank's new range of tools meant it could in future be able to control overheating markets without having to hike interest rates.\n\n\"We want to take the best of tradition and reinforce it,\" Carney said. The Bank has set out 15 new initiatives that it says will ensure the monetary, financial stability and regulatory wings of the Bank communicate with each other, are more open and accountable. It is also beefing-up its economic research, which will enable the bank to expand its \"analysis and data capability\".\n\nThe changes mean a lot of people will be moving desks. By August 1, almost half of the MPC's current members will either be in new roles or will have left the Bank.\n\nIt also means executives such as Andy Haldane, currently executive director for financial stability, and Spencer Dale, its chief economist, will broaden their experience. The pair will essentially switch roles, although their new jobs will differ slightly from current duties.\n\nA replacement for Broadbent's external seat on the MPC will be advertised in due course, the Treasury said, although technically, it could continue with eight members instead of nine, with Carney having the deciding vote in the event of a 4:4 split.\n\nThis streamlining will be made across the organisation. Shafik, a deputy director of the International Monetary Fund, will serve in the newly created role of deputy governor responsible for markets and banking, but will continue to liaise with former colleagues at G7 meetings, albeit from the other side of the table.\n\nEven the Bank's mission statement has been streamlined, bringing its twin goals of \"maintaining monetary and financial stability\" into one sentence.\n\nIf the Bank's shake-up on Tuesday can be likened to musical chairs, Paul Fisher is its loser. He will leave the MPC and join Andrew Bailey at the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). Some see this as a demotion, though the Bank insists Fisher's new post is of equal rank.\n\nShafik's appointment means she will be the first female to serve on the MPC since Kate Barker left in 2010, its first deputy since Lomax, who sat on the MPC between 2003 and 2008, and only the fifth woman to serve on the MPC out of more than 30 current or past members.\n\nOf course, Shafik is not the only high-profile woman at the Bank. Charlotte Hogg, the Bank's chief operating officer, was appointed last year to be Carney's \"eyes and ears\". But has much changed?\n\nMarian Bell, another former MPC member, said that, while Shafik's appointment was \"encouraging\", the Bank \u2013 like much of the City \u2013 had more to do to level the playing field. \"The bigger issue is there aren't enough women at senior levels in many areas and having no women on the MPC was just a symptom of that,\" she told The Telegraph. \"The disease is not cured with a small improvement in one of the symptoms.\n\n\"There have been more women before on the MPC. At the peak there were three of us on the nine-member panel, so having gone from a gap of there being none to having one, I don't think you can see that as an immense turnaround.\"\n\nEconomists also said changes announced on Tuesday added a \"degree of raised uncertainty\" to the direction of debate on the MPC. \"In Paul Fisher's departure the MPC is clearly losing a 'dove'. But in Dale's move off the MPC it is also losing a 'hawk',\" said David Tinsley, chief UK economist at BNP Paribas.\n\n\"At the same time, Nemat Shafik's views will be an unknown quantity for a while. Andy Haldane has a reputation as a 'free thinker'. How this translates into his views on monetary policy are not clear.\"","130":"Rather than take on US workers on relatively high wages, manufacturers will simply replace cheap labour in emerging markets with robots.","131":"* UK unveils big shake-up of top Bank of England officials\n\n* IMF's Shafik named as new deputy governor for markets\n\n* MPC's Broadbent to be deputy governor for monetary policy\n\n* BoE's Haldane replaces Dale as chief economist\n\n* Markets director Fisher to lose seat on MPC\n\nBy David Milliken and William Schomberg\n\nLONDON, March 18 Britain shook up the Bank of England on Tuesday, breaking the all-male grip at the top as it appointed two new deputy governors and a chief economist who has been highly critical of the banking industry.\n\nThe biggest single change in senior staff since the BoE gained independence in 1997 is accompanied by changes lower down which Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said were essential to wean the bank from its previous almost-exclusive focus on targeting inflation.\n\n\"With time, a healthy focus became a dangerous distraction,\" he said in a lecture in London's financial district. \"The reductionist vision of a central bank's role that was adopted around the world was fatally flawed.\"\n\nCarney also said the central bank needed to be more coordinated to manage \"great risks\" in the global economy, noting super-low interest could lead to complacency in financial markets.\n\nThe most striking of Tuesday's changes is that International Monetary Fund official Nemat Shafik becomes deputy governor for markets and banking - the first woman in a top policy role since 2010.\n\nBen Broadbent, until now an external member of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee, will step up to become deputy governor for monetary policy.\n\nIn a third move, executive director for financial stability Andy Haldane swaps jobs with chief economist Spencer Dale.\n\nDale had been a favourite to become deputy governor but will lose his MPC seat from June when he takes over Haldane's role on the Financial Policy Committee, which regulates banks.\n\nHaldane has been unusually outspoken for a central banker, criticising banks for trying to dodge regulation and addressing anti-capitalism protesters.\n\nThe changes - made by Carney and the government - are part of an overhaul to break down barriers between the Bank's monetary policy and bank regulation wings after the BoE was given major new supervisory powers in April.\n\nMarkets director Paul Fisher will lose his MPC seat to Shafik from Aug. 1, and will move to the bank's regulation arm. Fisher has been under fire from lawmakers over the BoE's handling of alleged manipulation of London's currency market.\n\nWhen asked by a reporter if there was a connection, Carney said the shake-up predated the foreign exchange scandal.\n\n\"The Bank needed a pretty major shake-up and it is certainly getting one,\" said Jonathan Portes, director of Britain's National Institute for Economic and Social Research.\n\nPortes said the new appointments should breathe fresh life into the central bank's macroeconomics team - which had a patchy forecasting record and was too inward-looking - and that Shafik had the right temperament to tackle market abuse.\n\n\"She's pretty tough and at the moment you need someone who is prepared to be fairly tough with the London financial sector,\" he said.\n\nBut Domenico Lombardi, a former IMF board member who now works for Canadian think tank CIGI, said: \"She will have some catch-up to do, because clearly banking and markets were not at the core of her responsibilities at the IMF.\"\n\nNEW DEPUTY GOVERNORS\n\nPrior to Tuesday's announcement, Carney had overseen the appointment of outsiders to two other top positions at the Bank.\n\nBroadbent was formerly a senior economist at Goldman Sachs - Carney's employer before he became a central banker. He will succeed Charlie Bean, who retires at the end of June.\n\nBroadbent has said the failure of troubled banks to lend money to more efficient firms is one of the reasons behind Britain's weak economic productivity since the financial crisis.\n\nShafik - who holds Egyptian, U.S. and British nationality - has a background in development economics, working at the World Bank and as the top civil servant at Britain's overseas aid department before becoming deputy managing director at the IMF.\n\nShe oversaw much of the IMF's work in the turnaround programmes for Greece and Portugal, and at the World Bank helped get private money into infrastructure projects.\n\nShafik will be responsible for the BoE's eventual exit from its quantitative easing policy, under which it amassed 375 billion pounds ($624 billion) of government bonds. She will also steer a review of how the bank gathers intelligence on markets.\n\nSince taking office in July, Carney has been keen to increase the number of women in senior roles at the BoE.\n\nBNP Paribas economist David Tinsley said the appointments were a surprise, and would add \"a degree of raised uncertainty\" about when the central bank would start to lift interest rates from their record low of 0.5 percent.\n\nLittle is known about Shafik or Haldane's views on monetary policy, though Portes said she had been sympathetic to the IMF's move away from its highly orthodox policy prescriptions.\n\nBroadbent and Dale both voted against the Bank's final expansion of asset purchases in July 2012, while Fisher was part of a dovish minority under former governor Mervyn King who wanted more asset purchases up until King's departure in June.\n\nBroadbent is the first external member of the MPC to take up a position as deputy governor. He will be responsible for the BoE's analysis of Britain's economy, as well as bank notes.\n\nBritain's finance ministry also named Anthony Habgood as chairman of the Court of Directors, which supervises the central bank. Habgood is chairman of brewer Whitbread and publishing company Reed Elsevier .\n\nHabgood succeeds David Lees, whose term expires on July 1.","132":"Our sincere apologies!

We have the tools, we're well armed to address those risks,\" said Carney. \"We're not going to use (those tools) just to prove that we can - we're going to use them in a proportionate, graduated way.\"\n\nConcern about the strength of the housing market prompted the BoE to stop encouraging banks to lend to home buyers under the Funding for Lending Scheme earlier this year.","135":"It\u2019s all change at the Bank of England, and mostly \u2013 to the extent that bringing in fresh blood and swapping senior positions around can ever make a real difference \u2013 of the welcome variety.\n\nPart of the purpose of bringing in a complete outsider to be Governor of the Bank of England was to shake things up, and to modernise the Bank for the awesome new set of responsibilities that have been loaded on to it.\n\nJudging by Tuesday\u2019s sweeping series of personnel changes, the new man at the helm, Mark Carney, does not intend to disappoint. Since arriving at the Bank in July last year, Mr Carney has given the impression of some kind of whirling dervish; scarcely a week goes by without some new initiative, speech or intervention.\n\nYet, beyond the tireless energy, there is also serious work to be done. Let\u2019s rewind to 1997 and Bank of England independence, something for which the Bank had long campaigned. In this moment of triumph, however, there was also a terrible defeat. In granting independence, the then Chancellor, Gordon Brown, stripped the Bank of its responsibility for banking supervision and adopted a divide-and-rule approach to the task of financial stability.\n\nEven at the time this seemed a questionable approach, yet Mr Brown was determined to have his new, politically correct financial regulator entirely divorced from the assumed City cronyism of the Bank. Hundreds of years of institutional knowledge and experience were recklessly thrown to the winds.\n\nAs Mr Carney observed in Tuesday\u2019s Mais lecture, the Bank\u2019s new-found focus on inflation targeting was to become a dangerous distraction. \u201cThe financial crisis that exploded the Great Moderation was a powerful reminder that price stability is not sufficient to maintain macroeconomic stability,\u201d the Governor said. \u201cWords which had alluded to such risks were not followed by actions that might have prevented them being realised.\u201d Quite so.\n\nNone of this is to denigrate Mr Carney\u2019s predecessor, Mervyn (now Lord) King. He can reasonably claim that even if he had seen the storm coming, he had been deprived of the tools to do anything about it. The Bank no longer has any such excuse; ironically given its obvious culpability in the crisis, it\u2019s now been given a whole shed load of screwdrivers, drills and saws to prevent it happening again.\n\nAnd that\u2019s essentially the backdrop to Tuesday\u2019s staffing changes. The most striking of these is the appointment of Nemat \u201cMinouche\u201d Shafik as one of two deputy governors. \u201cWho is she?\u201d you might ask, and indeed it is difficult to find anyone outside the Treasury and the Department For International Development, where she was once permanent secretary, who knows anything about her.\n\nThe only vaguely interesting thing I\u2019ve come across is that she was once married to the financial pundit Mohamed El-Erian, who is currently engaged in a furious row with his former co-head at Pimco.\n\nNevertheless she combines two apparently vital qualifications for the job \u2013 she\u2019s female, and therefore a breath of fresh air for the male-dominated Bank, and as a deputy managing director of the IMF, an international policy wonk. As technocrats go, she appears on paper to be hard to beat. Let\u2019s hope she proves so in practice, as she\u2019s been tasked with preparing markets for the unwinding of \u00a3375bn of quantitative easing.\n\nBen Broadbent, yet another Goldman Sachs alumnus (yawn), gets a well-deserved leg up to the other deputy governor\u2019s position, while Andy Haldane becomes chief economist, performing a job swap with the present incumbent Spencer Dale. This is an interesting appointment, too, since Mr Haldane, who is a thinking man\u2019s bank-basher, was thought to be at odds with Mr Carney\u2019s more accommodative approach to the City.\n\nDespite Mr Carney\u2019s best endeavours, there will eventually be fresh failures at the Bank of England. That\u2019s the way of regulation; whatever it does, it\u2019s doomed to ultimate failure. Greater professionalism, streamlining and communication \u2013 all these things the Bank needs in spades.\n\nBut it is always worth remembering the truism about organisational change, sometimes attributed, to give it the quality of ancient wisdom, to the Roman courtier Petronius Arbiter, even if there is no record of him actually saying it: \u201cWe trained hard . . . but it seemed that every time we were formed up into teams we would be reorganised. I was to learn later in life that we tend to meet any new situation by reorganising; and a wonderful method it can be for creating the illusion of progress while producing confusion, inefficiency and demoralisation.\u201d Still, always worth a try.","136":"The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has issued a warning against a new era of excessive borrowing of the type that led to the 2008 financial crash.\n\nMr Carney outlined a shake-up in a bid to consolidate the Bank's broader responsibilities within the UK, and opened the door to a future where its greater influence could exclude the need for interest rate rises to control the market.\n\nHe made the frank admission that low interest rates opened the door for \"similar risks\" to those which led to the 2008 crunch, with households and businesses lured into excessive borrowing.\n\nMr Carney indicated a move away from a previous period when its only goal had been achieving the inflation target of 2 per cent, saying this had become a \"dangerous distraction\".\n\nThe governor made the remarks as he unveiled details of a six-month strategic review which will result in sweeping changes in the Bank's structure. It came hours after the announcement of three new high-ranking appointments at Threadneedle Street.\n\nMr Carney's reforms consolidate new responsibilities for regulation and stability given to the Bank in the wake of the financial crisis in addition to its role in setting interest rates and keeping a lid on inflation.\n\nThe governor admitted that low rates before the crash contributed to the risk-taking posing dangers to the economy, adding: \"It doesn't take a genius to see that similar risks exist today.\"\n\nBut he said that new \"macroprudential\" powers held by the Bank - which include making sure banks have adequate levels of capital and tools to cool down an overheating housing market - could help.\n\nThey would reduce the need for interest rate policy to be \"diverted\" towards dampening excessive borrowing.\n\n\"That in turn may reduce the need for sharp or persistent moves in interest rates, which themselves might threaten financial stability,\" he said.\n\n\"Although monetary policy has an important role to play in mitigating financial stability risks, it does so only as a last line of defence.\"\n\nHe signalled frustration over a previous concentration purely on the inflation target, saying: \"With time, a healthy focus became a dangerous distraction.\"\n\nMr Carney said the widening of the Bank's responsibilities was a welcome return to its \"broad role\" of the past - citing the \"judicious exercise of the governor's eyebrows\" historically to manage and resolve financial crises.\n\nBut he added: \"The age of informal responsibilities, nods winks, secrecy and instinct is long past.\"\n\nInstead, a series of new positions and directorates are to be set up at Threadneedle Street would formalise the position.\n\nPolicy makers have said that any rise in interest rates from their current historic low of 0.5% will be limited and gradual.\n\nBut Mr Carney said they were \"fully aware that an environment of relatively low and predictable interest rates could encourage excessive risk-taking in financial markets and by households\".\n\nHe said the previous reduced view of the Bank's functions had been \"fatally flawed\", failing to recognise that financial stability was as important as price stability, as he unveiled his new \"One Bank\" plan to be rolled out over three years.\n\nIt will undertake 15 initiatives, with a key aim of maximising the effectiveness of the Bank's work by breaking down barriers between separate areas of its work.\n\nMr Carney said the plan also \"sweeps away a proliferation of internal committees that held up decision making\".\n\nThe Bank will adopt a new mission statement: \"Promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability.\"\n\nIt said the motto embodied the public service mission of the institution that had been in place since its original 1694 charter.\n\n\"In short, we are creating a central bank for the 21st century that combines the finest aspects of our history and traditions with the best of the modern and new,\" Mr Carney said.\n\nThe reforms include the creation of a new independent evaluation unit to support the Bank's oversight committee - beefing up its self-policing in the wake of damaging allegations that some officials knew about attempts to rig foreign exchange rates.\n\nIn a shift towards greater transparency, Mr Carney also said the Bank would publish the results of regular bank stress tests, as well as more of the research and analysis underlying policy choices.\n\nEarlier today, the Bank announced the appointment of Dr Nemat Shafik to take on the newly-created role of deputy governor responsible for markets and banking.\n\nDr \"Minouche\" Shafik will join on August 1 with a priority to conduct a root-and-branch review of how the Bank monitors markets following the forex allegations.\n\nMeanwhile, Ben Broadbent, already a member of the nine-strong rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, was named as successor to Charlie Bean, the outgoing deputy governor for monetary policy.\n\nAnthony Habgood, chairman of Costa Coffee and Premier Inn group Whitbread, will become chairman of the court of the Bank of England as part of a raft of appointments.","137":"Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world.","138":"The item that you have requested was not found.\n\nPossible causes:\n\nThe address was entered incorrectly\n\nThe item no longer exists\n\nThere has been an error on the site\n\nIf you feel the address you entered is correct you can contact us, mentioning the error message received and the item you were trying to reach.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience.

Shafik will also have to shape how the Bank winds down its quantitative easing programme of money printing, which so far has injected \u00a3375 billion of credit into the economy.\n\nThe lack of woman on the MPC, which sets the future path of interest rates, has forced the government to fend off accusations of a Tory \"women problem\" as the Treasury has ultimate responsibility for approving the appointments of all the members.\n\nTeresa Pearce, Labour member of the Treasury select committee, told HuffPostUK: \"When recruiting, people choose people they feel most comfortable with, and they feel comfortable with people who are like them. Until we have true diversity, we have to expect they will still choose people they play golf with.\"\n\nEx-MPC member professor Danny Blanchflower told HuffPostUK: \"It doesn't seem to be that hard to find high quality female economists to join the MPC and other public bodies. The Tories do seem to have a problem with women.\n\nTreasury minister Sajid Javid recently caused controversy for suggesting that women did not merit being on the committee as he said that \"all appointments are made on merit\".\n\nLabour shadow treasury minister Cathy Jamieson said: \"It\u2019s pretty outrageous for a Treasury Minister to imply that the reason there are no women on the Monetary Policy Committee is because appointments are based on merit.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cThese comments reflect a deeper problem within David Cameron\u2019s government, which is totally out of touch with women across the country.\"\n\nBank of England governor Mark Carney was revealed by HuffPostUK to have piled pressure on Osborne to consider appointing female economists to the Bank's MPC.\n\nThe Treasury also announced today that current MPC member Ben Broadbent would take over from Charlie Bean in July as deputy governor for monetary policy and that Anthony Habgood would take over as chair of the Bank's board, known as the Court.\n\nAlso on HuffPost:","150":"London - Call it the \"new neutral.\"\n\nWhen Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney begin lifting interest rates from record lows, investors are betting the benchmarks stay below historic averages.\n\nWhile neither central bank has plans for increases any time soon, improving economies are spurring debate about the appropriate levels for neutral interest rates, which neither stimulate nor slow growth. Interest-rate swaps show the U.S. federal funds rate will crest at 3.1 percent in five years, below the average of 4.8 percent in the 20 years ending 2007, while the key BOE rate tops out at 2.8 percent, about half its long-run average of 5 percent.\n\n\"Most people agree that potential gross-domestic-product growth is lower than before the crisis and will continue to be lower for at least a few more years,\" so central bank benchmark rates also will be lower, said Torsten Slok, chief international economist in New York for Deutsche Bank AG.\n\nPolicy makers across the globe adopted emergency measures to stave off financial turmoil following the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008 and subsequent recessions. At the Fed, these included cutting the rate on overnight loans among banks to near zero in December 2008. The BOE chopped its official bank rate to 0.5 percent in March 2009.\n\nNow U.S. and U.K. policy makers are trying to tamp down investor anticipation of higher borrowing costs, saying increases aren't on the immediate agenda.\n\nYellen said March 5 the U.S. economy \"continues to operate considerably short\" of the Fed's goals for inflation and employment. Two days later, Fed Bank of New York President William C. Dudley said market expectations that the central bank will raise its main rate \"around the middle of 2015\" are \"very reasonable.\"\n\nThe BOE also isn't in any rush to remove emergency stimulus that's entering a sixth year because the economy probably will be in \"extraordinary times a few years down the road,\" Carney told lawmakers in the U.K. Parliament on March 11. Weakness from Europe and the higher cost of credit also reinforce the case for limited rate increases. \"We need to take all those factors into account so that we are setting policy that's consistent with an economy operating at it potential.\"\n\nSupporting his position are BOE data on the spreads between the central-bank rate and market interest rates. The average premium on a two-year fixed-rate mortgage with a 75 percent loan-to-value ratio was 1.87 percentage points above the benchmark in February, up from 0.32 percentage point in July 2007. Company credit spreads were about 1.9 percentage points higher in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter of 2007.\n\nBecause of the widening, \"it would be very surprising if rates were to go back to where they were pre-crisis,\" said Mike Amey, a London-based money manager at Pacific Investment Management Co.\n\nSuch an environment may restrain the yield on government securities. Interest rates on 10-year U.S. Treasuries will rise to 3.4 percent by the end of this year from 2.67 percent at 12:35 a.m. London time, based on the median estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey. That's below the 4.32 percent average for the five years ending 2008.\n\nTen-year U.K. gilt yields will be above 3.5 percent when the BOE stops raising its benchmark, according to 86 percent of 100 investors in a Royal Bank of Scotland Group survey. The yield averaged 4.78 percent in the decade ending December 2008.\n\nMost respondents in the RBS poll, released this month, said the BOE benchmark will reach the neutral rate in 2017, with almost half predicting it will be between 2 percent and 2.99 percent.\n\nFor equity investors, weaker-than-traditional monetary policy may represent a buying opportunity, even when interest rates do begin to rise, said Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank AG in London. U.S and some emerging-market stocks could be bolstered, while prices of assets such as commercial and industrial property will increase, he said.\n\nCentral banks are making \"a big bet that there's a lot of slack in the economy and that they can continue to run interest rates below their natural level,\" said Sarah Hewin, head of research at Standard Chartered Bank in London. \"If you get that wrong, you very quickly start to generate inflation, but central banks are always more concerned about the risk of deflation than the risk of inflation.\"\n\nLow borrowing costs also may spark asset bubbles. The average for a two-year fixed-rate mortgage in the U.K. was 2.37 percent in February compared with 5.74 percent in February 2008, BOE data show. That helped push home prices up 5.5 percent in December from a year earlier to a record 250,000 pounds ($415,200), while London values surged 12.3 percent to an all- time high of 450,000 pounds, according to data from the Office for National Statistics.\n\nAs rates stay low, the BOE is relying on so-called macroprudential tools to fine-tune prices, including ending support for home loans under the Funding for Lending Scheme this year.\n\n\"One of the problems with the low interest-rate policy is that central banks are washing their hands of the consequences of any asset-price booms,\" Commerzbank's Dixon said. This could stoke up a bubble in the next couple of years that \"might pop quite badly later on.\"\n\nYellen countered such concerns in response to a question during testimony before the House Financial Services Committee.\n\nThe Fed is \"highly focused on trying to identify those threats,\" she said Feb. 11. \"The stock market broadly has increased in value very substantially over the last year, and our ability to detect bubbles is not perfect, but looking at a range of traditional valuation measures doesn't suggest that asset prices broadly speaking are in bubble territory.\"\n\nAt the end of their Jan. 28-29 meeting, U.S. policy makers left unchanged their statement that they probably will hold their benchmark rate near zero \"well past the time\" unemployment falls below 6.5 percent, \"especially if projected inflation\" remains under their longer-run goal of 2 percent. They have said they can use other tools to control price acceleration, such as the ability to pay interest on the cash financial institutions park at the central bank.\n\nThe jobless rate was 6.7 percent in February, and the Fed's preferred inflation gauge was at 1.2 percent in January. With unemployment forecast to go below 6.5 percent this year, Yellen may announce guidance that's less specific as soon as this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nCarney made such a shift after Britain's jobless rate fell to 7.1 percent in the three months through November-just above the 7 percent his Monetary Policy Committee had identified as the level for a possible rate increase. In February, the BOE issued a revised plan that includes a range of indicators including measures of involuntary part-time employment and long- term joblessness, and a renewed emphasis on communications with households and businesses.\n\n\"We still don't know how much potential output was destroyed during the crisis,\" said Joachim Fels, chief international economist at Morgan Stanley in London. \"Potential output growth has come down.\"\n\nIn Britain, GDP was 1.4 percent smaller in the fourth quarter than at the peak in early 2008, supporting the BOE's view that there's enough spare capacity to keep rates low without fueling price acceleration.\n\nWhen the central bank does begin raising its benchmark, \"it will probably do so only gradually and to a level that is likely to remain materially below its pre-crisis average of 5 percent for some while,\" BOE policymaker Charles Bean said in a speech last week at the North East Chamber of Commerce in Darlington, northern England.\n\n\"I have something like a 2 percent to 3 percent range in mind here,\" he said. \"Even if we start to withdraw some of the exceptional monetary stimulus in the not-too-distant future, you should not expect bank rate to shoot straight back up to pre- crisis levels.\"","151":"Our sincere apologies!

Thanks for your patience!","152":"By David Milliken\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Governor Mark Carney's first big shake-up of the Bank of England could set off changes on its interest rate-setting committee, with markets chief Paul Fisher at risk of losing out.\n\nCarney, who took over last year, had already been planning changes to the upper echelons when the central bank was drawn into a scandal over alleged manipulation of currency markets.\n\nHe is due to give details in a speech on Tuesday of his plans, which include creating a deputy governor who will be responsible for overseeing markets and banking services.\n\nThe new position, which takes the number of deputy governors to four, reflects broad powers the BoE has gained under a reform of British financial regulation since the global crisis.\n\nUntil recently Fisher - who is Executive Director, Markets - would have been an obvious candidate for the new position which covers much of his current job, albeit with expanded responsibilities and at one level higher in the BoE hierarchy.\n\nBut the BoE suspended an employee this month in an internal investigation into whether staff turned a blind eye to signs of manipulation of London's $2.1 trillion-a-day currency market.\n\nThere is no evidence of wrongdoing by Fisher, who was previously the suspended employee's manager, but he came under fire last week from a parliamentary committee over his role in supervising currency markets.\n\nThe stakes are high for Fisher. His term on the Monetary Policy Committee - where he was one of the stronger supporters of more stimulus for Britain's economy after the financial crisis - ends in May.\n\nAs a BoE executive director, this would normally be renewed automatically but if Fisher misses out on the job, he might have to make way on the committee for the new deputy governor.\n\nAsked if Fisher or other BoE staff would apply for the new post, the BoE said it had no comment on possible candidates. It also did not comment on what impact, if any, the inquiry would have.\n\nFisher has said he first heard of the currency accusations only last October, and that the alleged collusion by market-makers under investigation now was different from less serious discussions about hedge funds' activity as far back as 2006.\n\nWith the results of the internal inquiry unlikely until next year, Carney might be reluctant to promote Fisher before he knows its conclusions.\n\nCarney said the creation of the new role was not a response to the inquiry, but whoever fills it will conduct \"a root and branch review of how we conduct market intelligence\".\n\nDetails of the new deputy governor's role and broader changes at the BoE should become clearer on Tuesday. One of the aims is to integrate better teams of financial supervisors who joined the BoE last April, when it assumed powers to ensure the banking sector does not put the economy at risk again.\n\nHowever, former Monetary Policy Committee member Andrew Sentance said he feared the new deputy governor might be given no real authority. \"In my experience, all important decisions in the Bank are taken by and announced by the governor,\" he said.\n\nFISHER ON THE HOOK?\n\nLegal restrictions on whom Carney can appoint to another BoE body - the Financial Policy Committee which regulates British banks - are creating further complications. Oddly, these make it unlikely that the new deputy governor will have a vote on the committee and will attend only in an advisory capacity.\n\nTherefore, to avoid the fourth deputy governor looking like a spare wheel compared with the three existing ones, the new post could come with a seat on the Monetary Policy Committee - although there is no guarantee of that.\n\nMembership of the committee, on which two of the three existing deputy governors all sit, is fixed at nine. So if the new job goes to someone other than Fisher, he might be the one who has to make way for the new arrival.\n\nBritain's finance minister chooses seven committee members,\n\nand the Treasury is expected to name a replacement for one of them - retiring deputy governor for monetary policy Charlie Bean - on Tuesday, a source familiar with the appointments process said.\n\nCarney has the final say on the remaining two: the BoE's chief economist and an official with executive responsibility for monetary policy operations.\n\nThe latter description seems to fit the new deputy governor's position. Carney said whoever gets the job would have \"the senior-most executive responsibility\" for the BoE's 375 billion pounds ($623 billion) of bond holdings accumulated under its drive to help the economy recover from the crisis.\n\nFisher is currently responsible for the BoE's monetary policy operations.\n\nEven without a year-long inquiry hanging over him, Carney may wish to continue his pattern of recruiting externally for senior BoE jobs. \"Carney might want to get his own person from outside, to add to that impression of the Bank being shaken up and having more outside influences,\" said Tony Yates, a senior BoE economist until last year and now reader in economics at the University of Bristol.\n\nAnother possibility is the BoE's chief cashier and executive director for banking, Chris Salmon.\n\nBut Yates said it was far too early to rule Fisher out from a more senior role at the BoE. He also said that removing Fisher from the Monetary Policy Committee would be seen as a demotion within the bank. \"If the new deputy governor takes the slot of (Fisher) ... that would be a headache for them,\" said Yates.\n\nShowing how seriously the BoE is taking the foreign exchange allegations, the inquiry will be led by lawyer Anthony Grabiner, who previously investigated phone-hacking at Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.\n\n\"What the Bank is likely to be more concerned about, and the regulators are certainly concerned about, is that it would appear the systems and controls weren't sufficient to detect or deter what has happened,\" said Owen Watkins, a financial services lawyer at Lewis Silkin in London.\n\nLawmakers - who scrutinize but cannot veto top BoE appointments - were unimpressed when Fisher said last week it was the job of the Financial Conduct Authority, Britain's chief markets regulator, not the BoE, to investigate malpractice.\n\n\"This is the first real test for the BoE's new governance structures. Early signs are not encouraging,\" said Andrew Tyrie, who chairs the parliamentary Treasury committee.\n\n(Additional reporting by Jamie McGeever; editing by William Schomberg, Alexander Smith and David Stamp)","153":"Mulberry has announced that its CEO, Bruno Guillon, is stepping down after two years.\n\nGullion, formerly of Herm\u00e9s, will leave the Somerset-based luxury handbag maker immediately.

But, like others in the market, it has been taken by surprise by the arrival of aspirational brands at the lower end of the luxury range, such as Michael Kors.\n\nAt the end of January, it was forced to cut profit forecasts for the third time in 18 months, after weak demand in South Korea and heavy discounting over Christmas in Britain which contributes 65 percent of sales.\n\n\"The board agreed that it was now time to part company,\" a source familiar with the situation told Reuters.\n\nMulberry, which makes Bayswater and Alexa handbags that sell for up to 4,500 pounds, said Frenchman Guillon would leave immediately, without saying if he would receive any payoff.\n\nThe warning wiped over 25 percent off Mulberry's shares in January, a loss from which they are yet to recover.

He drilled into staff the importance of being friendly to customers and the firm's internal mantra \"we don't believe in bad manners, fashion egos or size zeros\" was an antidote to austere Bond Street boutiques.\n\nBack then, Mulberry's classic Bays-water bag, costing \u00a3500, was within touching distance for many British women. Today, after Guillon introduced more exotic finishes such as ostrich skin, they start at around \u00a3900. Its smallest bag \u2013 a clutch style wallet measuring 11cm by 20cm \u2013 costs \u00a3495, while keyrings run to \u00a3100.\n\nHaving watched Burberry's success over the last decade, Guillon was eyeing the $390bn global market for designer clothes and accessories, where well-heeled shoppers do not bat an eyelid at a four- or five-figure price tag. Recent initiatives include a collaboration with model Cara Delevingne unveiled at London fashion week and included a bag inspired by her lion tattoo.\n\nBut with more than 60% of Mulberry's sales rung up in the UK, its traditional shoppers were priced out of the market and have since defected to fast-growing brands such as Michael Kors and Coach whose arm candy are priced at a fraction of their more illustrious rivals.\n\nWhen Guillon took over in 2012 Mulberry could do no wrong for shoppers or investors. It was the sleeper success of the luxury goods sector, having quietly metamorphosed from a staid brand, adopted by the green welly brigade in the 1980s, into a fun and unpredictable label capable of conjuring up \"it-bags\" that \"it-girls\" such as Chung were happy to sling over their shoulders. Like many brands it owes a debt to Kate Moss, a friend of Hill's, who lit a fuse in the fashion press when she stepped out with a Bayswater in the crook of her arm a decade ago. Moss's patronage proved a turning point for the brand, putting it on the radar of Grazia readers.\n\nLorna Hall, head of retail at trend consultancy WGSN, said it can be very hard for fashion brands to move upmarket and even more so in the glare of the stock market where executives are forced to publish regular sales updates. \"When you make this kind of shift there is always a danger of alienating your existing customers,\" she said. \"Mulberry has made a big shift in its prices. It had customers who were willing to pay \u00a3500 but they won't go above that. She was Mulberry shopper - not a Louis Vuitton or a Chanel shopper.\"\n\nDavis has rescued the brand before. He took charge in 2002, when after years of losses, Mulberry's biggest shareholder, the Singaporean billionaire Christina Ong, ousted the founder, Roger Saul, in a bloody boardroom coup. History repeated itself on Thursday but there were no tears, from investors anyway, with the shares closing the day up more than 5%.","177":"(Writes through, adds details)\n\nBy Neil Maidment and Kate Holton\n\nLONDON, March 20 Bruno Guillon has quit as chief executive of British luxury brand Mulberry, bringing an end to a two-year tenure marked by three profit warnings during an attempt to move upmarket that has failed to pay off.\n\nUnder Guillon, Mulberry hiked prices in an effort to become more exclusive and win back customers who were upgrading to pricier brands.

It warned that even though seasonally driven quarterly declines have become routine for industry watchers, the annual dip illustrates longer-term downward pressure even as economic conditions gradually improve.\n\nLooking at subs for cable, satellite and telco\/IPTV providers, SNL Kagan found that service providers collectively shed 251,000 customers in 2013, dipping to approximately 100 million combined subs. The industry added 40,000 video subscriptions in the fourth quarter, slightly weaker on a year-over-year basis but, said the analyst, not enough to offset the broader downward momentum.\n\nAs shown in other recent research cable is the industry's whipping boy and SNL Kagan found that losses from cable providers fueled the overall declines. It calculated that cable operators lost nearly 2 million video subscriptions for the full year and 388,000 in the fourth quarter to finish 2013 with fewer than 54.4 million basic subs. That said it also discovered that the estimated figures for the industry did show some improvement in the fourth quarter on both sequential and year-over-year comparisons.\n\nSatellite growth slowed in the fourth quarter as both leading firms DISH Network and DIRECTV focused on high-value customers. Yet despite challenges, both firms controlled churn and produced net subscriber gains for the year, gaining 101,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter, contributing to a year-end gain of 170,000 subscribers. Nearly all of the annual gain was contributed by DIRECTV. Despite the loss of 162,000 subscribers in second quarter 2013, the DBS segment ended at 34.3 million subscribers.\n\nAT&T's U-verse was the engine for a telco market that finished 2013 strongly. When combined with subs for arch rival Verizon's FiOS service, the top two telcos added 286,000 customers in Q4 2013 leading to a grand total of 10.7 million.","182":"Not Found\n\nThe requested URL \/story.php\\ was not found on this server.\n\nApache\/2.2.15 (CentOS) Server at www.satnews.com Port 80","183":"SNL Kagan: Pay-TV Lost 2 Million Video Subscribers in 2013\n\n\n\n\n\nCable continues to shed video subscribers, unlike satellite and telcom, as consumers embrace subscription streaming\n\nThe multichannel video program distribution industry (cable, satellite and telecom) lost a collective 2 million video subscribers in 2013, prompting the first overall industry subscriber loss, according to new data from SNL Kagan.\n\nThe research firm said that while MVPD households still hover around 100 million \u2014 a benchmark the industry has maintained for years \u2014 the industry lost a collective 251,000 subscribers when factoring in high-speed Internet, telecommunications and Comcast\u2019s fourth-quarter uptick of 40,000 video subs.\n\nNotable factors include growing consumer adoption of subscription streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Instant Video and Hulu Plus. All three services posted significant subscriber gains in 2013.\n\nIndeed, Kagan reported MVPDs lost about 388,000 video subscribers collectively in the fourth quarter, with basic video households now numbering about 54.4 million.\n\nWhile cable operators lost the bulk of video subs, telecom operators Verizon FiOS TV and AT&Ts U-verse upped their combined video sub base by 1.6 million to 10.7 million.

The industry added 40,000 video subscribers in the fourth quarter, slightly weaker than the year-earlier period and not enough to offset the losses in earlier months.\n\nRising prices, pay-TV operators' poor customer service, enhanced offerings from video streamers and other online distractions are pushing more TV watchers to ditch their monthly cable bills. Until 2013, the industry has been able to maintain its year-over-year growth despite the defections, as legions of customers still enjoy its easy-navigation tools and live programming.\n\nBut the full-year decline is a worrisome development that could signal an irrevocable downturn for the video segment of the industry that is scrambling to upgrade options to retain customers.\n\n\"While seasonally driven quarterly declines have become routine for industry watchers, the annual dip illustrates longer-term downward pressure even as economic conditions gradually improve,\" SNL's report said.\n\nIn an interview with USA TODAY's editorial board Tuesday, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts said the nation's largest cable provider lost customers 26 quarters in a row until it eked out a gain in the fourth quarter last year.\n\nTo stem the loss in the video business, the Philadelphia-based company is offering more on-demand and other video options stored in the cloud and looking to introduce new subscription tiers, he said. \"Our (profit) margin has gone back on video,\" he said, citing rising programming costs as a contributing factor.\n\nThe decline in video subscription is attributable partly to consumers who never bothered to order new service as they moved into new homes. \"Housing formation was modest but still outpaced new subscriptions,\" it said.\n\nThe cable operators suffered the highest rate of decline, losing nearly 2 million subscriptions to finish last year with fewer than 54.4 million.\n\nThe two main satellite TV providers, Dish Network and DirecTV, gained 170,000 subscribers, \"forestalling an annual decline for perhaps another year,\" the report said. DirecTV contributed nearly all of their annual gain. There were 34.3 million satellite subscribers as of the year-end.\n\nThe \"telco\" segment, which includes the companies that offer fiber-optic based TV services, fared better than competitors. Verizon FiOS and AT&T's U-verse, the two dominant companies in the segment, gained 286,000 customers, reaching 10.7 million. Customers of CenturyLink's PrismTV totaled 175,000 after adding 9,000 new subscriptions.

That news comes from media analyst firm SNL Kagan, based on its estimates for the cable, satellite, and telco industries through the end of 2013.\n\nPay TV providers ended the year with around 100 million subscribers, collectively down by 251,000. The fourth quarter was actually a positive one, with pay TV adding 40,000 subscribers, but that number was down year-over-year and wasn't enough to make up for the deficit.\n\nCable lost the most subscribers, down 2 million for the year. By the end of the year, it had under 54.4 million basic subscriptions. While growth slowed for satellite providers Dish and DirecTV, both gained subscribers in 2013. Most of the gain came from DirecTV. Satellite ended the year with 34.3 million subscribers. Telcos, led by AT&T U-verse, also had a positive year.\n\nSNL Kagan's numbers help frame the ongoing debate of whether or not online video companies are eroding the pay TV market. While an overall loss of a quarter million subscribers isn't cause for alarm, and pay TV advocates will see it as a minor aberration, it could well mark the beginning of a trend where many U.S. households get their video entertainment entirely through streaming sources.\n\nPage 1","188":"Cable, satellite TV and telecom firms collectively shed 251,000 video subscribers in 2013, led by continued cable losses, the research firm estimates.\n\nThe U.S. pay TV industry in 2013 recorded its first-ever full-year subscriber decline, SNL Kagan said Tuesday in confirming what industry watchers had previously predicted.\n\nCable TV, satellite TV and telecom firms offering video services collectively shed 251,000 subscribers in 2013, led by continued cable losses, the research firm estimated.\n\nThe industry added 40,000 video subscriptions in the fourth quarter, helped by a return to video sub growth at cable giant Comcast, but it wasn't enough to make up for losses earlier in the year.\n\nPHOTOS: 10 Highly Paid Entertainment Executives\n\nThe decline comes as some cable operators' improving pay TV subscriber momentum has effected the continuing cord cutting debate.\n\nAs of the end of the year, the number of pay TV subscribers dipped to approximately 100 million, according to SNL Kagan.\n\n\"The fourth-quarter subscription bump did not carry enough magnitude to lift the penetration rates sequentially,\" the firm said. \"Housing formation was modest but still outpaced new subscriptions.

Today, too few have too much, too many have too little, and the middle class is sinking.''\n\nWhitman defended HP's track record, pointing out that the company has been fighting for racial diversity among its suppliers for more than 40 years. She also boasted that HP may be the only major company that employs women in the positions of CEO and chief financial officer, a reference to Catherine Lesjak.\n\nJackson congratulated her, but then chided Whitman for the absence of blacks and Latinos on HP's board. \"We are not perfect by any means,'' Whitman conceded and assured Jackson she hoped to continue to discuss ways to promote more racial diversity in Silicon Valley.\n\nIn a letter Monday, Jackson raised similar issues with a list of other technology companies that included Apple Inc., Twitter Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google Inc.\n\nEarl \"Butch'' Graves Jr., president and CEO of Black Enterprise magazine, said Jackson is shining a light on the fact that technology companies don't come close to hiring or spending what is commensurate with the demographics of their customers.\n\n\"Hopefully, what Rev. Jackson is doing will bring attention to the 800-pound gorilla in the room that nobody wants to talk about. It's high time that gets addressed,'' Graves said.\n\nIt's widely recognized that the tech industry lacks diversity: About 1 in 14 tech workers is black or Latino, both in Silicon Valley and nationally. Blacks and Hispanics make up 13.1 and 16.9 percent of the U.S. population, respectively, according to the most recent census data.\n\n\"We agree with you there is much work to be done in the United States and much work to be done in Silicon Valley,'' Whitman told Jackson during the meeting.\n\nYet as recently as 2011, The Allstate Corp., in alliance with Jackson's RainbowPUSH organization, recognized HP for its commitment to diversity.\n\nIn an emailed statement to The Associated Press, HP Executive Vice President Henry Gomez said HP spent nearly $1 billion with almost 500 minority business enterprises in the U.S. and an additional $500 million with businesses owned by women during 2013.\n\nApple and Google declined to comment on Jackson's grievances.

These critics say that after Jackson targeted companies over diversity issues in the financial sector and other industries, some have ended up donating large sums to Jackson's organizations. In other cases, the targeted companies gave contracts to minority-owned firms that paid Jackson for referrals.\n\nGraves, of Black Enterprise, dismisses such concerns.\n\n\"If in the fight to create opportunity, some of the money that these companies would contribute to United Way or the American Heart Association happens to go to (Jackson's) Rainbow Coalition, I'm more than OK with that,'' he said.\n\n\"That's just the fear factor coming from when they see him,'' Graves said, \"because they know he's not going to go away.''\n\n\n\nCopyright Associated Press","193":"Useragent Blocked\n\nYour user agent has been blocked from this site.

That\u2019s despite the fact that women, blacks, and Latinos often disproportionately use the tech products that come out of Silicon Valley more than the standard white male does.\n\nThat\u2019s why Jesse Jackson is planning on crashing the HP shareholders meeting this afternoon. Jackson revealed earlier this week that he plans to lead a delegation to HP\u2019s headquarters to call attention to the lack of diversity in Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cAt its best, technology can be a tremendously positive change agent for the world; at its worst, it can hold on to old patterns that exclude people of color and women from opportunity and advancement,\u201d Jackson wrote in a letter to Google, Facebook, Apple, Twitter, HP, and other major tech companies. \u201cWhen it comes to African Americans on Board \u2013 ZERO. C-suites, ZERO. Minority firms in IPOs and financial transactions, advertising and professional services \u2013 ZERO.\u201d\n\nAmong S&P 500 companies, whites made up a total of 86.7% of board seats, and among the Fortune 500, only five CEOs\u20141%--are black. Meanwhile, black and Hispanic consumers continue to outpace white consumers in terms of smartphone ownership (59% of blacks and 61% of Hispanics own smartphones, compared to 53% of whites). Additionally, black, Hispanic, and female consumers are more likely than whites and males to use social networking sites.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s not entirely clear why HP is the focus of Jackson\u2019s campaign\u2014and indeed, Jackson admitted that he\u2019s not trying to single out HP. In 2011, HP was actually recognized by Allstate in alliance with the Rainbow PUSH Coalition (which was formed by Jesse Jackson) for using more minority firms in its debt offerings.\n\n\u201cWhile we certainly agree that diversity is an important issue in corporate America, we\u2019re puzzled by Rev. Jackson\u2019s sudden interest in HP. Today, HP is the largest company in the world with both a female CEO and CFO and nearly half of our leadership team and Board of Directors are women and minorities,\u201d said HP EVP Henry Gomez, in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to seeing Rev. Jackson at our shareholder meeting.\u201d\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not just the big tech companies. Diversity remains a problem among smaller tech startups as well. Just last week, Julie Ann Horvath became the first Github engineer to quit after two years of harassment and sexism in the workplace, which went largely ignored until now.\n\nIn a startup class in 2012, Max Levchin himself admitted that PayPal once rejected a candidate who aced all of the engineering tests purely because he said he liked to \u201cplay hoops\u201d for fun. Additionally, he admitted that PayPal had a hard time hiring women because the startup was made up of a bunch of nerds who simply didn\u2019t know how to interact with women, let alone hire them.\n\n\u201cOne good hiring maxim is: whenever there\u2019s any doubt, there\u2019s no doubt. It\u2019s a good heuristic. More often than not, any doubt precluded a hire,\u201d said Levchin.\n\nSo the mystery of why there are so few women and minorities in tech isn\u2019t quite as mysterious as we once thought.","199":"The technology field continues to grow at a rapid pace, but African-Americans and Latinos are being left out of the mix. Rev. Jesse Jackson is calling attention to the lack of diversity Wednesday by leading a delegation at a Hewlett-Packard's annual shareholders meeting.\n\nJackson is expected to address the poor representation of Blacks and Latinos in hiring, board appointments and startup funding, according to the Associated Press. He is not targeting HP specifically, but is instead using the meeting to address a wider industry issue.\n\n\n\n\"Technology is supposed to be about inclusion, but sadly, patterns of exclusion remains the order of the day,\" Jackson wrote in a letter released Monday to Apple Inc., Twitter Inc., Facebook Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co., Google Inc. and others.\n\n\n\nAssociated Press reports:\n\n\n\nIt's widely recognized that the tech industry lacks diversity: About 1 in 14 tech workers is black or Latino, both in the Silicon Valley and nationally. Blacks and Hispanics make up 13.1 and 16.9 percent of the U.S. population, respectively, according to the most recent census data.\n\nYet as recently as 2011, The Allstate Corp., in alliance with Jackson's RainbowPUSH organization, recognized HP for its commitment to diversity.\n\n\"While we certainly agree that diversity is an important issue in corporate America, we're puzzled by Rev. Jackson's sudden interest in HP,\" HP Executive Vice President Henry Gomez said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press. \"Today, HP is the largest company in the world with both a female CEO and CFO, and nearly half of our leadership team and board of directors are women and minorities.

In a letter issued under the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, a nonprofit organization focusing on social justice that Jackson cofounded, the Reverend shames tech companies for pushing boundaries in all areas but diversity. \"Technology is supposed to be about inclusion, but sadly, patterns of exclusion remains the order of the day,\" Jackson writes. \"When it comes to African Americans on Board \u2013 ZERO. C-suites, ZERO. Minority firms in IPO\u2019s and financial transactions, advertising and professional services \u2013 ZERO. These ZEROES are contrary to the enlightened values exposed by the industry.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Silicon Valley has been shamed for its dearth of minorities and women. Apple was recently criticized for only having one woman, ex-Avon CEO Andrea Jung, on its board of directors, and many people including shareholders and activists voiced concerns about white males dominating the company and the industry as whole. Apple responded by revising its corporate charter to specifically say that it will actively seek out women and minorities for board seats in the future.","201":"In a recent letter published by the Rainbow\/PUSH organization, Reverend Jesse Jackson chastised Apple and a number of other Silicon Valley tech firms for the dearth of female and minority employees among the executive ranks.\n\nThe letter reads in part:\n\nTechnology is supposed to be about inclusion, but sadly, patterns of exclusion remains the order of the day. When it comes to African Americans on Board - ZERO. C-suites, ZERO. Minority firms in IPO's and financial transactions, advertising and professional services - ZERO. These ZEROES are contrary to the enlightened values exposed by the industry. Rainbow PUSH is seeking meetings with tech leaders to address these ZEROES head on.\n\nWith respect to Apple and corporate diversity, the company currently has only one female board member -- Andrea Jung. It is worth noting, though, that Apple this spring will wellcome Angela Ahrendts as the company's new retail chief. Also of note is that Apple last year hired former EPA chief Lisa Jackson, herself an African American, this past May.\n\nThe San Jose Mercury News further adds:\n\nAnother African-American, Denise Young-Smith, runs Apple's human resources department, which oversees the personnel policies governing the iPhone maker's nearly 85,000 employees and contractors. She reports directly to Apple CEO Tim Cook.\n\nEarlier this year, Apple amended its Nominating and Corporate Governance charter to read that the company is \"committed to actively seeking out highly qualified women and individuals from minority groups to include in the pool from which board nominees are chosen.\" While the move was welcomed by some, others viewed it as nothing more than an empty gesture.\n\nSome of the other companies on the receiving end of Jackson's letter include Twitter, Facebook, HP, and Google. Indeed, Jackson plans to attend HP's annual shareholders meeting today in an effort to bring more attention to the issue.\n\nAnd speaking of HP, company VP Henry Gomez issued the following statement to the Associated Press today in response to Jackson's letter.\n\nIt reads in part:\n\nWhile we certainly agree that diversity is an important issue in corporate America, we're puzzled by Rev.

Facebook and Twitter didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nOf course, the technology industry isn't without a handful of high-profile black executives.

Stocks soared over 180 points a day after Crimea, a region in Ukraine, voted to secede and join Russia. (Photo: Andrew Burton Getty Images)\n\nNEW YORK - Stocks were hammered Wednesday after the Federal Reserve, under its new chief Janet Yellen, said it would dial back its stimulus by an additional $10 billion per month and updated its guidance on when the central bank might start raising short-term interest rates.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average closed down 114.02 points, or 0.7% to 16,222.17. The Standard & Poor's 500 and Nasdaq composite each fell 0.6%.\n\nAfter the 2 p.m. ET announcement, the Dow, which had been up around 7 points, slid and was down about 150 points around 3:15 p.m.\n\nA comment by Yellen at her first news conference suggesting the Fed could start raising short-term interest rates \"six months\" after it ends its bond-buying program spooked investors. Her comments were interpreted as a sign that rates would rise sooner than Wall Street had anticipated.\n\nWhether that takeaway was accurate, it created confusion about the timing of the Fed's exit strategy.\n\nThe big market move came in the government bond market, where prices dropped, and yields, which move in the opposite direction, rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped to 2.77%, vs. 2.68% Tuesday and 2.74% before the Fed released its statement.\n\nThe additional $10 billion per month \"taper\" of its bond-buying program to $55 billion per month was expected.\n\nWhat investors were wrestling with was the Fed's change to its forward guidance related to the timing and circumstances surrounding future increases on short-term interest rates, which are now roughly zero percent.\n\nThe Fed did away with its prior guidance, which was quantitative threshold based on the nation's jobless rate. The Fed had been using a 6.5% unemployment rate as its 'threshold\" to start the process, or at least kick off the debate, about raising rates. However, with the jobless rate now at 6.7% and the rate itself viewed as a flawed measure of the actual health of the job market, the Fed opted to phase out the numerical threshold.\n\nIn its place, the Fed will assess its rate outlook using a \"wide range of information,\" including \"measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial developments.\"\n\nWall Street was still digesting what the new \"qualitative\" guidance means for the rate-hike timetable.\n\nThe Fed's new \"qualitative\" guidance might be more market-friendly than the market's knee-jerk reaction to the downside might indicate, says Sung won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University.\n\n\"The tilt toward the more qualitative approach would mean future monetary policy is likely to be more dovish and accommodative that it would have been under the previous guidance,\" Sohn says.\n\nStill, investors were not expecting the Fed participants upward revision to its future projections for rates, notes Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics.\n\nThe median forecast now puts the so-called Fed funds rate at 1% by the end of 2015, up from 0.75% back in December, and 2.25% by the end of 2016, up from 1.75%.\n\nStill, the Fed reiterated that it would keep rates \"below normal levels\" for a \"considerable time after\" it has ended its bond-buying program, which was reassuring for investors.\n\nYellen, the first-ever Fed chair, will hold a press conference after the end of its two-day policy meeting. It is the central bank's first policy meeting since Janet Yellenreplaced Ben Bernanke as chair.\n\nAs expected, the Fed continued to reduce its monetary stimulus at the speed it has already set, trimming its monthly bond purchases by another $10 billion. It is also expected to revise its economic forecasts.\n\n\"Forward guidance will be the most closely watched aspect of the meeting,\" says market strategist Andrew Busch of The Busch Update.\n\nKB Homes, one of the nation's largest homebuilders, jumped 6% to $18.72 after the company reported much higher profits than investors were expecting. KB earned 12 cents a share, four cents more than analysts had forecast. The company also said the average selling price of a new home rose 12 percent from last year.\n\nTechnology giant Oracle fell 0.8% to $38.55. The database software maker reported a slight rise in revenue and profit from a year ago, but the results came in short of analysts' predictions. Oracle's results dragged down IBM, SAP and Microsoft.\n\nIn economic news. the nation's current account deficit declined to $81.1 billion, or 1.9% of GDP, in the final quarter of 2013, which marks a 16-year low.\n\nIn Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 added 0.4% at 14,462.52 and China's Shanghai composite index fell 0.2% to 2,021.73.\n\nEuropean shares were mixed as Britain's FTSE 100 index was down 0.5% to 6,573.13 and Germany's DAX index rose 0.4% to 9,277.05.\n\nOn Tuesday, the S&P 500 index rose 13.42 points, or 0.7%, to 1,872.25. The Dow rose 88.97 points, or 0.6%, to 16,336.19. The Nasdaq composite climbed 53.36 points, or 1.3%, to 4,333.31.\n\nContributing: Associated Press","213":"The European are firmly in negative territory on Thursday, following weak cues from Asia and Wall Street overnight, after the release of the Fed's policy announcement, the first under new Fed Chair Janet Yellen.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee, at the end of its two-day policy meeting, forecast that its federal funds rate target would be 1 percent by the end of 2015 and 2.25 percent a year later, higher than previously forecast. Also, the Fed dropped the 6.5 percent unemployment threshold while adopting qualitative guidance for considering interest rate increases.\n\nOn a day of light economic news, the Federal Statistical Office said Germany's producer prices fell for the seventh successive month in February, and the rate of decline matched economists' forecast. The industrial producer price index decreased 0.9 percent in February from the same month last year, following a 1.1 percent contraction in January.\n\nThe Swiss National Bank maintained its currency ceiling and the near zero percent interest rate. The SNB retained its minimum exchange rate of 1.20 Swiss francs per euro.\n\nThe Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks is losing 0.96 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major U.K. companies, is falling 0.82 percent.\n\nThe German DAX is falling 1.01 percent, the French CAC 40 is losing 0.88 percent and the UK's FTSE 100 is declining 1.06 percent. Switzerland's SMI is down 0.43 percent.\n\nIn Frankfurt, Deutsche Boerse is losing 2.7 percent.

The company said the impact of the Chancellor's proposals for greater choice in pensions would be far-reaching.

REUTERS\/Larry Downing\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen answers a question at a news conference following the March 2014 Federal Open Market Committee meeting, while at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington, March 19, 2014. REUTERS\/Larry Downing\n\nWASHINGTON The U.S. Federal Reserve will probably end its massive bond-buying program this fall, and could start raising interest rates around six months later, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said on Wednesday, in a comment which sent stocks and bonds tumbling.\n\nYellen's remarks at her first news conference as the head of the central bank pointed to a more aggressive path toward higher interest rates than many had anticipated, and bets in financial markets shifted accordingly.\n\nThe comments came after a two-day meeting in which Fed officials made another reduction in their bond-buying stimulus and decided to jettison a set of guideposts they were using to help the public anticipate when they would finally raise rates.\n\nThe Fed said the change in its rate hike guidance did not mark a shift in its intentions and that it would wait a \"considerable time\" after shuttering its asset purchase program before pushing borrowing costs higher.\n\nYellen, who had fielded numerous questions without a hitch, hesitated when asked what the Fed meant by \"considerable.\"\n\n\"I -- I, you know, this is the kind of term it's hard to define, but, you know, it probably means something on the order of around six months or that type of thing. But, you know, it depends -- what the statement is saying is it depends what conditions are like.\"\n\nSeveral analysts wondered whether her answer was an unintended slip, given the deliberately vague language of the Fed's statement.\n\nEither way, the reaction in financial markets was swift and sharp. Prices for U.S. stocks and government bonds added to earlier losses triggered by fresh Fed forecasts that showed policymakers are inclined to raise rates a bit more aggressively than they had been just a few months ago. The U.S. dollar rose.\n\n\"The forecast change could be interpreted as a relatively hawkish shift ... and as such the general market reaction seems well-founded,\" said JPMorgan economist Michael Feroli.\n\nFutures traders moved to price in a first interest rate hike as soon as April 2015. Previously, it was July.\n\nMost top Wall Street economists, however, continued to see the first rate hike in the second half of 2015, according to a Reuters poll.\n\nMIXED MESSAGES\n\nYellen sought to use her news conference to emphasize that rates would stay low for awhile and rise only gradually. She also said they could end up staying lower than normal \"for some time\" even after the jobless rate drops to a healthy level.\n\nThe Fed would look not only at how close inflation and unemployment are to its goals, but how fast, or slowly, those measures are approaching those goals, she said.\n\nAt 6.7 percent, the unemployment is well above the 5.2 percent to 5.6 percent range Fed officials see as in keeping with full employment. The central bank's favored inflation gauge is barely more than half of its 2.0 percent target.\n\nThe Fed has held interest rates near zero since late 2008 and has pumped more than $3 trillion into the economy with its bond purchases to try to foster a stronger recovery.\n\nOf the Fed's 16 policymakers, only one believes it will be appropriate to raise rates this year; 13 expect a first rate hike next year, and two others see the first rate hike coming in 2016, according to the new forecasts.\n\nBut once rate hikes start, Fed officials see slightly sharper increases than they did in December, when they last issued forecasts. They now see rates ending 2016 at 2.25 percent, a half percentage point above their December projections. ID:nL2N0MG1AP]\n\nThe unease in markets \"might be a sign that people think Yellen will tighten sooner rather than later,\" said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at Rockwell Securities in New York.\n\nMEASURED WIND DOWN\n\nThe central bank proceeded with its well-telegraphed reductions to its massive bond-buying stimulus, announcing it would cut its monthly purchases of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to $55 billion from $65 billion.\n\nThe decision to further scale back its stimulus keeps the Fed on track for the measured wind down laid out by Yellen's predecessor, Ben Bernanke. The Fed repeated that it plans to continue trimming the purchases in \"measured steps\" as long as labor conditions continue to improve and inflation shows signs of rising back toward the Fed's 2.0 percent goal.\n\nThe Fed's assessment of the U.S. economy chalked up recent weakness partly to adverse weather.\n\nIt had said since December 2012 that it would not consider raising short-term rates until the jobless rate fell to at least 6.5 percent, as long as inflation looked set to remain contained.\n\nBut the unemployment rate has fallen faster than anticipated, and officials dropped the guidance, saying they would look at a range of economic indicators to judge the economy's readiness for higher rates.\n\nMinneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota dissented, saying that getting rid of the numerical guidance could hurt the credibility of the Fed's commitment to return inflation to 2.0 percent.\n\n(Corrects date to 2015 in paragraph 11)\n\n(Reporting by Ann Saphir and Krista Hughes; Additional reporting by Jason Lange in Washington and Chuck Mikolajczak in New York; Editing by Tim Ahmann and Andrea Ricci)","216":"HONG KONG (AP) \u2014 Asian stock markets bounced back Friday as upbeat U.S. economic data helped shake off worries about future increases in U.S. interest rates.\n\nTrading was subdued as Japanese markets were closed for a public holiday.\n\nThe Conference Board index of leading indicators, a measure of U.S. economic health, rose in February by the largest amount in three months, suggesting growth should bounce back following a harsh winter.

The timing had been July to August beforehand.\n\nYet many were not convinced the timetable had moved much at all.

The precious metal vacillated around $20.85 through today\u2019s Asian session and then, minutes before the London open, a trivial sell-off sent the price to an intraday low of $20.705., Since then though, buyers of last resort have reversed the dip and right now silver is trading at around $20.879, down just 0.02 percent intraday.\n\nToday the focus of the markets is likely to shift from Eastern Europe to the US, where the Federal Open Market Committee will announce its latest monetary policy decision in a statement due out at 18:00 UTC. The current meeting is the first under the leadership of new Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen and she is scheduled to front a press conference at 18:30 UTC.\n\nThe US central bank is widely expected to announce a further $10 billion reduction in the monthly pace of its bond-buying programme, reducing it to $55 billion. The two prior tapers resulted in sharp but short-lived drops in the price of silver (see chart below).\n\nThe FOMC is expected to also release updated economic projections and markets will be paying close attention to the forecasts.\n\nAs RBS chief economist Michelle Gerard puts it: \u201cThe shift to qualitative guidance will put more focus on the Fed\u2019s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), particularly the 'dots' that reflect participants expectations for the funds rate at the end of 2015, 2016 and over the longer term.\u201d\n\nCommerzbank senior technical analyst Axel Rudolph expects silver in the coming month to bounce off the 20.65\/49 major support zone (October lows and December\/January highs) and target the 22.73\/23.12 region.\n\n\u201cCurrently unexpected failure at 20.65\/49 would push the psychological 20.00 mark back to the fore\u201d, counsels the Commerzbank chartist. \u201cOnly an unexpected daily close below the 19.57 November low would force us to neutralise our medium term outlook.\u201d","219":"iNVEZZ.com, Thursday 20 March:\n\nSilver today tumbled to a 5-week low of $20.225 as the market fine-tuned its expectation for the start of US interest rate-tightening, following yesterday\u2019s monetary policy decision by the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s rate-setting arm yesterday announced another $10 billion reduction in the monthly pace of its quantitative easing programme, tapering it to $55 billion per month. Janet Yellen, in her first FOMC meeting as Fed chair, surprised the market by indicating that the first US rate hike since the financial crisis could happen \u201caround six months\u201d after the end of the QE program, which she sees concluding this autumn.\n\nIf the Committee continues with its gradual $10 billion taper-steps per meeting, the asset purchases would be halted this October, which would imply that Yellen expects rate-tightening to start in April 2015. \u201cThe market isn\u2019t pricing the first hike until August next year\u201d, emphasizes Danske Bank chief analyst Allan von Mehren.\n\nFollowing the policy decision, US Treasury yields and the greenback have been on the rise, while bullion prices have been hammered from the hawkish surprise by the US central bank. It is worth noting that after the Fed had announced taper-step number two on 29 January, silver found a bottom the very next day.\n\nHowever, analysts at Credit Agricole underline that the latest shift in rate-tightening expectations may turn out to be \u201cthe catalyst of a sustained rise in US Treasury yields and broad USD strength\u201d that a lot of market participants have been expecting.\n\nYellen\u2019s remarks were also backed by the Committee\u2019s median rate path forecasts for end-2015 and end-2016, which were revised higher from 0.75 percent to 1.0 percent and from 1.75 percent to 2.25 percent respectively. The FOMC also ditched the 6.5 percent unemployment threshold embedded in its forward guidance.\n\nRight now, silver is trading at 20.321, down 1.5 percent intraday.","220":"Our sincere apologies! Try one of these pages on our site to help you find your way back to digital civilization. Thanks for your patience!","221":"Stock markets fell and the US dollar soared on Wednesday after the latest FOMC meeting signalled a more hawkish stance being adopted by policymakers.\n\nNew Head of the Fed Janet Yellen said that monthly tapering would continue and could be completely wound up by the fall. She went on to suggest that the first rate rise could come just 6 months after and that the bank expects interest rates to be at 1% by the end of 2015 and 2.25% a year later.\n\nOn top of that, officials agreed that central bank policies should no longer be tied to the target 6.5% unemployment rate, stating that a broader range of data measures will be used instead.\n\nAs a result, stock markets dropped sharply, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average giving up 200 points in a short space of time, and the US dollar advancing against all of it\u2019s major trading partners. was hardest hit, falling as much as 1.06% by the close, while and both moved higher by over 1%. Gold, too, tumbled in the face of the stronger dollar.\n\nFXeeda moves\n\nOur signals reacted to developments with profitable positions in (+71.9 pips) and (+109 pips). At the time of writing, our signals continued to indicate strong sell positions for and while we had moved to flat in the Dax.\n\nThe change in sentiment from the Federal Reserve saw drop sharply, move through its pivot and through the third support where it is currently trying to gather some momentum. The currency was overbought anyway, so the Fed announcements were a nice catalyst for euro bears.\n\nA quick bounce may be on the cards on here, however, it is likely to be short lived. The hawkish statement from the Fed has taken traders by surprise and could lead to more volatility in financial markets over the next couple of sessions. Traders should look to hold their EURUSD shorts until the dust settles and wait for traders to return to risk-on markets.\n\nEUR\/USD\" title=\" \" height=\"242\" width=\"474\" \/>","222":"The US dollar is consolidating yesterday's dramatic gains against the major foreign currencies. Prior to the outcome of the FOMC meeting, we had accepted that even as the Fed shifted from a threshold approach to forward guidance to a more qualitative approach, the goal of the new chair would be to underscore continuity.\n\n\n\nThe way we suggested Yellen's performance could be evaluated was by having little change in market expectations for the first rate hike, which previously was in late Q3 or Q4, depending on the instrument one looked at and the interpolation. By that measure, yesterday was a flop.\n\n\n\nTo be sure, Yellen emphasized that there was no change in the FOMC's policy intentions. Nevertheless, the takeaway was that the FOMC was more hawkish than expected. The market focused on two elements.\n\n\n\nFirst, Fed funds at the end of next year are now seen at 1.0%, up from 0.75% in December 2013, when the last projections were made. Just as importantly, at the end of 2016, Fed funds are seen at 2.25%, up from 1.75%.\n\n\n\nSecond, the FOMC said that there would be a \"considerable period\" between the completion of the asset purchases and the first increase in rates. We would file this phraseology under \"strategic ambiguity\". However, when pressed, Yellen opined that a \"considerable period\" could be around six months.\n\nParticipants quickly did the math. It anticipates the FOMC completing the asset purchases in October. Yellen's clarification\/expansion points to a hike as early as Q2 15. It would not be surprising if in subsequent commentary, the Fed's leadership tries to backtrack from those implications. We expect the first hike to be in late Q3 or Q4 2015.\n\n\n\nHowever, it may be hard to put the proverbial toothpaste back in the tube, especially if the economic data bounces back as the weather impact fades. Moreover, there may be more lasting damage to the Fed's credibility. Under Bernanke, the Fed had developed another tool to help manage expectations. It was individual (but not by name) forecasts for GDP, core inflation, unemployment and anticipated Fed funds rate. Yellen attempted to play down the hawkish results of what she called the \"dot plot\".\n\n\n\nRecall our reservations. We had argued that if Obama and Bernanke wanted to ensure Yellen was a weak leader they would 1) make it clear she was not the first choice; 2) have Bernanke announce the tapering and exit strategy from QE; 3) name a vice chairman who is bound to overshadow her; and 4) have Bernanke stay until the very end, although Yellen was confirmed in early January. Of course, they did precisely this and it serves as a backdrop for yesterday's debacle.\n\nWe also recognized that despite some perceptions to the contrary, Yellen is not really a super-dove as she is often portrayed. We perceive her as an independent and pragmatic leader. We also recognized that the Fed presidents rotating to voting positions on the FOMC cast it in a somewhat more hawkish direction. That said, we suspect when the new nominees are confirmed, the next forecasts (June) will include a softening of yesterday's apparent signal.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the FOMC, developments in China remain a major focus for the markets. For the second consecutive session, the dollar rose more than 1% above the PBOC's yuan fix. The greenback traded a little above CNY6.23, for a new 12-month high. While some observers have placed a greater deal of emphasis on the CNY6.20 level as triggering large scale losses on highly leveraged investment instruments, our understanding is that it is more dynamic and the pressure has been increasing since CNY6.15.\n\n\n\nWhile some US\/Europe-based hedge funds are thought to be involved, our understanding is that these positions are primarily held by domestic investors, not foreign. If Chinese officials wanted to continue to wash out the speculative positioning and moral hazard, we suspect that the dollar needs to rise through CNY6.30.\n\n\n\nMany economists have revised down their GDP forecasts for the world's second largest economy. The mettle of Chinese officials and the extent of their willingness to emphasize the quality of growth rather than the quantity are being tested and they appeared to have blinked. Chinese officials announced they would expedite construction and infrastructure projects that had already been approved.\n\n\n\nGiven the restrictions on foreign investors\u2019 access to mainland equities (A-shares), many take exposure through the Hong Kong Enterprise Index (H-shares), which tracks Chinese companies trading in Hong Kong. With today\u2019s 1.7% decline, the index has now surpassed a 20% decline from last December's high. While some argue this is a sign of a bear market, we note that the real high was recorded not in late 2013, but back in late 2010. Even with the latest declines, this index is still about 6.4% above last year's lows. We cite this not a as a bullish sign, but simply to put the recent losses in perspective.\n\n\n\nThe rise in US yields weighed helped lift the dollar against the yen. The weaker yen did not spill over and help the Nikkei, as appears to be often the case. The Nikkei fell 1.7%. The dollar faces technical resistance in the JPY102.50-80 area.\n\n\n\nWhile the dollar is consolidating yesterday's gains against the yen, it is extending its gains against the euro in the European morning. The euro is falling through its 20-day moving average (~$1.3815) and slipped through the $1.3800 level. This was the top of the 5-cent, 5-month trading range that was broken when the ECB refused to adjust policy earlier this month.\n\n\n\nThe Draghi-rally began in the $1.3730-50 area and this would be a test of the resolve of the euro bulls. The retracement objectives of the euro's rally off the year's low (Feb 3 ~$1.3477) are found near $1.3780 and then $1.3720.\n\n\n\nThe US reports weekly initial jobless claims, the March Philadelphia Fed survey and Feb existing home sales. Of the three, we suspect the Philly Fed survey is the most important for market psychology. An improvement here would, like the Empire State survey, strengthen ideas that the weather was an important, even if not only, economic headwind at the start of the year.\n\n\n\nAlso, with the money supply figures after the markets close, the Fed will also report on its custody holdings. Recall last week, on a Wednesday-to-Wednesday basis (as opposed to a weekly average) the Fed's custody holdings of Treasuries for foreign central banks fell by about $105 bln. This outsized drop, a record, still appears to have been a shift away from the Fed's custody services, but probably not a sale.\n\n\n\nThe Canadian dollar is the weakest of the majors over the past five sessions, losing about a 1.6% against the greenback and is at new 4.5 year highs. The seemingly hawkishness of the Fed and the seemingly dovishness of the Bank of Canada has taken a toll. On Friday, Canada reports retail sales and CPI figures. We had expected the Canadian dollar to sell off in response to what is anticipated to be soft inflation figures, which the central bank is particularly sensitive to. However, there is risk of sell the rumor and buy the fact type of activity. That said, previous resistance (~CAD1.12) now may act as support.","223":"European Market Update European markets weather more hawkish Fed stance relatively well in session Notes\/Observations Fed Chair Yellen dovish reputation flouts hawkish feathers at her debut press conference; estimated the \"considerable period\" of low rates at the end of QE as a mere 6 months.

The Fed decided after its two-day meeting concluded on Wednesday to slash bond purchases by another $10 billion to $55 billion and signaled it may raise interest rates by next year, giving a boost to the dollar, which climbed to three-week high yesterday. The Dollar index, which tracks the value of the U.S. dollar against a basket of other major currencies, was trading 0.17 percent higher at 80.30 from a session opening at 80.17, and higher compared with Wednesday's intraday high of 80.24. The euro declined for a second straight session against its U.S. counterpart, shedding 0.33 percent and was last seen at $1.37828. The Australian dollar fell back below 91 U.S. cents and was last at $0.90146 after opening at $0.90316. Yellen's words led the dollar sharply higher, as she said the Federal Reserve will probably end its massive bond-buying program this fall, and could start to raise interest rates around six months later, sooner than what was previously expected. Combined with a slight rise in the projected path for rates by Fed members, Yellen announced she will link raising interest rates to a broader range of economic data rather that a drop in jobless rate to a 6.5 percent threshold. The dollar bought \u00a5102.489, not far from its nearly one-week high of \u00a5102.69 yen touched on Wednesday. The USDJPY pair so far hit a session high at \u00a5102.508 and session low at \u00a5102.207. Swiss Franc Slips, SNB Maintains Currency Cap The Swiss franc posted heavy losses in Europe weighed by the Swiss National Bank's (SNB) decision to keep rates on hold and maintain its exchange rate floor against the euro. The central bank, led by President Thomas Jordan, kept its ceiling on the franc at 1.20 per euro and the target range for its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.0% to 0.25%, in line with forecasts. The USDCHF pair rose to CHF 0.88483, sharply above to the two-week highs of CHF 0.8828 reached on Wednesday. The pair started the day at CHF 0.88170. The euro moved higher after the SNB reiterated it would enforce the 1.20 per euro minimum exchange rate floor with unlimited interventions if necessary. The bank believes the Swiss Franc is high and as a result is delaying inflationary rise. Euro edged higher against the franc as well, marking the fifth consecutive session of gains. The EURCHF pair is currently trading at 1.21938 after opening at 1.21807","238":"People walk past an electronic information board at the London Stock Exchange in the City of London October 11, 2013.

St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher, Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota and Fed Governor Jeremy Stein are all due to talk. <FED\/DIARY>\n\nClarity may not be forthcoming, however, as each has very different outlooks on policy stretching from the hawkish Fisher to the dovish Kocherlakota.\n\nAgainst a basket of major currencies, the U.S. dollar was trading at 80.186 .DXY , not far from the high of 80.354, a level not seen since late February.\n\nThe euro wallowed at $1.3777, having plumbed a two-week low of $1.3749.

The currency has fallen more than 1.2 percent this week, which would be the largest weekly loss since 1992.\n\nGovernment economists and advisers involved in internal policy discussions told Reuters that the central bank chose to widen the yuan's trading band since it was less risky than other reform options while also offering a way to hedge against further economic slowdown.\n\nA weaker yuan would provide some relief to struggling exporters and the PBOC has the means to steer it lower while avoiding sharp swings.\n\nHowever, a major drop in the yuan could put pressure on other nations in the region to depreciate their currencies and keep their exports competitive.\n\nSeveral currencies from the Thai baht to Malaysian ringgit did indeed turn lower on Thursday and dealers will be watching nervously to see if that could be the start of a trend.\n\nIn commodity markets, Gold was pinned at $1,330.60 an ounce having shed 3.7 percent for the week so far.\n\nBrent rose 60 cents to settle at $106.45 a barrel on Thursday.

The employment outlook is ever so slightly more positive but GDP forecasts for this year were taken down a modest peg. That excepted, the FOMC doesn\u2019t see much difference between today\u2019s economy and the one they described in December. There is a slight weakening. Other than that, the committee does not appear to be expecting much difference in the economy relative to the outlook in December.\n\nThings seem a bit weaker than January, but bad weather obscures the true state.\n\n\u201cYou have to read this statement as risk off,\u201d Steven Englander, a strategist at Citigroup, said in a note to clients.\n\n\u201cOther than the very short-term bounce from the bad weather of this winter, supply-side projections are weaker, not stronger, but rates projections are higher.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Fed\u2019s own projections, fed funds can be expected to be higher in the future than they thought in December. The median projection by FOMC officials was for an end-2015 rate of 1 percent, as against 0.75 percent in December. Rates at the end of 2016 are seen at 2.25 percent, up 50 basis points compared to December\u2019s forecasts.\n\nIf you ask me, an economy which is getting stronger at the same languid rate but is seeing interest rates rising faster is one seeing real tightening in monetary conditions.\n\nIt is very possible that we see a row back, a bit more dovishness, in the next week or so from Fed officials. If not, Santa Claus Fed \u2013 that old tendency for the market to usually rise around FOMC meetings \u2013 may be a thing of the past.\n\nPerhaps even more importantly, Janet Yellen during her press conference indicated that rates might be expected to rise six months after the taper is done and QE ends. That puts the first rate rise in the first several months of next year, a good bit sooner than markets had been anticipating.\n\n\u201cIt depends what conditions are like\u201d in the labor market, Yellen said, by way of hedging, also noting that the Fed might hold if inflation stays low.\n\nStill, the central forecast is for getting higher rates without getting much of a recovery.\n\nThat\u2019s terrible for financial markets, which are duly selling off.\n\nHawkish, or ham-handed\n\nInteresting too that Yellen, in her first press conference as Fed chair, argued that we should be paying more attention to the statement, which was a record 877 words, than to the hard data in the charts and forecasts of the economic projections.\n\nWords, as any lawyer will tell you, are inexact in their meaning, a state to which the FOMC statement always seems to aspire and usually reaches.\n\nThat desire, if that is what it is, for wiggle room, was also underscored by the decision to drop the 6.5% unemployment rate threshold.\n\nTwo options seem possible to me:\n\n1 - That the Fed is more hawkish, but doesn\u2019t really want to discuss it that openly.\n\n2 - That giving the impression of rates going up more quickly was a bit of a communications fiasco.\n\nIf we look at the first it is significant that Yellen said that some Fed officials \u201cnote that the potential growth rate of the economy may be lower at least for a time.\u201d\n\nIf potential growth rate of the economy is lower, keeping low rates won\u2019t give you as much bang for your buck, but will still potentially distort markets and the economy. That\u2019s an argument for raising rates sooner, a sort of argument of exhaustion with low rates.\n\nThe Fed also seems to see normalization of rates but sees that normal as being lower than before, another nod to lower potential growth. That\u2019s a sclerotic, stagnant economy, and a disaster for risk assets.\n\nNow on the other hand, as is so often the case, the Fed may look around at the falls in financial markets and re-think their position. Yellen may simply have made a rookie mistake in being so specific about the timetable, and may wish for a do-over.\n\nIt is very possible that we see a row back, a bit more dovishness, in the next week or so from Fed officials. If not, Santa Claus Fed \u2013 that old tendency for the market to usually rise around FOMC meetings \u2013 may be a thing of the past.\n\n(At the time of publication James Saft did not own any direct investments in securities mentioned in this article.

As for when those rates would rise, policymakers decided to abandon their previous threshold of 6.5% unemployment, in favor of a broader view of the job market.\n\n\"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent,\" the statement said.\n\nForward guidance: The Fed modified its so-called forward guidance for a potential interest rate hike, because its previous guidance of 6.5% unemployment wasn't leaving much wiggle room.\n\nThe unemployment rate stood at 6.7% in February. And according to its latest economic forecasts released Wednesday, the Fed now believes the unemployment rate could fall as low as 6.1% this year.\n\nThe Fed has now decided to move toward a more qualitative approach in determining interest rate policy.\n\n\"This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments,\" Fed officials wrote in the statement.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the meeting, Yellen said the job market has improved more than many had anticipated, though she stressed that it's still weak and offered a list of various labor market measures that the Fed would be looking at.\n\nYellen said repeatedly that the change in guidance does not signal any immediate shift in the Fed's current policy intentions. She said rates would likely remain low for a \"considerable period\" after the Fed's bond-buying program ends.\n\nInvestors were spooked after Yellen responded to a question by suggesting that a \"considerable period\" could be defined as around six months. That led investors to believe that rates could rise sooner than previously thought. The Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 100 points in afternoon trading.\n\nTapering: The Fed has been buying bonds -- mainly long-term Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities -- since September 2012 in an attempt to stimulate the economy. But it began reducing the program this year in a process nicknamed \"tapering.\"\n\nThe Fed has said it would continue its plan to taper by $10 billion a month unless its outlook for the economy changed substantially.\n\nWhile the job market had been in a rut over the winter, economists have speculated that the slump was a temporary result of extreme weather, and indicators would recover in spring.\n\nIn its statement, the Fed said economic activity slowed during the winter months, \"in part reflecting adverse weather conditions.\"\n\nYellen said bad weather contributed to a spate of weak economic data over the first few months of the year. But she said most Fed officials expect the drag from cold weather will \"begin to wash out in second quarter.\"\n\nOnly one Fed member formally dissented against the statement. Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota felt that the change in forward guidance could weaken the Fed's credibility and cause uncertainty.","252":"This will appear next to all of your comments\n\nThis will NOT appear anywhere on Newser","253":"Yellen\u2019s words led the futures market for the US Fed funds rate to shift to pricing in around a 50-50 chance of the first hike in May to June next year. The timing had been July to August beforehand. Photo: Bloomberg\n\nLondon: The dollar steadied at higher levels on Thursday and stocks and bonds fell across the globe as investors positioned for US interest rates to rise sooner and faster than previously thought.\n\nGlobal stocks as measured by the MSCI world equity index dropped 0.6%, adding to the previous day\u2019s losses after Federal Reserve chairperson Janet Yellen said the US central bank might end its bond-buying programme this autumn, and could start to raise interest rates around six months later.\n\nCombined with a slight rise in the projected path for rates by Fed members, that led the market to bring forward the likely timing of the first hike in US rates by a couple of months.\n\nThe whiplash was felt most in the short end of the treasury market which is more sensitive to the course of the Fed funds rate. Yields on two-year notes shot up 8 basis points (bps) on Wednesday to 43 bps, the sharpest single-day rise since mid 2011, and were trading at 42 bps on Thursday.\n\nEuropean stocks dropped 0.4% on Thursday, following losses of more than 1.5% in Japan and other Asian markets.\n\nYellen sought to use her news conference to emphasize that rates would stay low for a while and rise only gradually, but the message was lost on skittish markets.\n\nHer words led the futures market for the US Fed funds rate to shift to pricing in around a 50-50 chance of the first hike in May to June next year. The timing had been July to August beforehand.\n\nYet many were not convinced the timetable had moved much at all. A Reuters poll of 17 primary dealers found 10 still expected the first hike to come in the second half of 2015, and four were still tipping 2016.\n\n\u201cLooking at the performance of markets this morning, there is no real followthrough,\u201d said Simon Derrick, a currency strategist with Bank of New York Mellon. \u201cPeople are looking for reasons why the range should break. I don\u2019t think Yellen was the thing to do it.\u201d\n\nYields on 10-year notes were at 2.76%, having risen 9 bps on Wednesday. German Bund futures , the benchmark for European bonds, fell 60 ticks.\n\nThe rise in US yields in turn helped lift the dollar and sent the euro reeling back a full cent on Wednesday. But the dollar steadied at $1.3826 on Thursday. Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar was holding at 79.993 after adding 0.8% on Wednesday.\n\nThe US currency was slightly up at 102.42 yen, having jumped a full yen on Thursday and away from important chart support in the 101.20\/30 zone.\n\nThe dollar\u2019s gains were gold\u2019s undoing, sending the metal down to three-week lows of $1,319.61 an ounce.\n\nThe prospect of rising rates in the US has not been good for some emerging markets as it threatens to draw capital away, pressuring equities and currencies.\n\nEmerging stocks fell more than 1% on Thursday to the week\u2019s lows, within sight of their worst level in six-weeks.\n\nThe rate rise expectations also come as China seems to be weakening its yuan as a way to support a slowing economy, which puts pressure on other nations in the region to lower their currencies to stay competitive on exports.\n\nThe yuan skidded 1.33% below the daily midpoint fixing to its lowest in a year at 6.2275 per dollar, a long way from where it started the year at 6.0515 and a huge move for the normally tightly-controlled currency.\n\nLast weekend, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) doubled the daily trading band allowed for the yuan to 2% from the mid-point that it sets each day.\n\nIn oil markets, Brent futures fell 21 cents to six-week lows of $105.62 per barrel, while US crude oil added 2 cents to $100.39.

The 6.5% unemployment rate threshold has been lightly removed, in part due to the quality of that 6.5% number. The big number thrown out was in the Q&A session of her forecast speech today, which may have simply been \u201coff the cuff\u201d comments rather than words to be set in stone.\n\nJanet Yellen said that the near-zero Fed Funds rate would remain for a considerable period after the bond buying program ends. She then identified the considerable period as probably around six months.\n\nSo, if the tapering of $10 billion ends this fall or so \u2014 let\u2019s just say the October FOMC meeting \u2014 then that puts the rate hikes coming as soon as April of 2015. The market interpreted this as a more hawkish Janet Yellen but that may not be the case. Again, this is how the market is interpreting her wording based upon Fed Fund Futures.\n\nA look at the CME Fed Fund Futures now has April 2015 as the first date that the Fed Fund Futures are pricing in a 100% chance of rates rising to 0.25% ($99.73). That is 5.5 basis points lower than before the meeting. The prior 100% chance was in the May to June range for 2015.\n\nThe Fed Fund Futures now have a 100% chance priced in that August 2015 will be 0.50% in Fed Funds. December of 2015 is the month that Fed Fund Futures are pricing in a 0.75% Fed Funds rate.\n\nAs far as when the Fed Fund Futures are pricing in 1% in Fed Funds \u2014 that was February 2016 right up until the copy-paste of the Fed Futures image below.

Investors didn\u2019t buy it.\n\nIn her first press conference as Fed chair yesterday, Yellen emphasized that dropping a 6.5 percent unemployment threshold for considering an interest-rate increase \u201cdoes not indicate any change in the committee\u2019s policy intentions.\u201d\n\nRather than paying heed to Yellen\u2019s assertion, investors seized on an increase in Fed officials\u2019 own interest-rate forecasts and Yellen\u2019s comment that borrowing costs could start rising \u201caround six months\u201d after it stops buying bonds.

Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. \u201cWith the shift to qualitative guidance, the only quantitative metric we have is the fed funds projections from the Fed,\u201d said Dean Maki, chief U.S. economist for Barclays Plc in New York and formerly an economist at the central bank. \u201cSo while the statement and Chair Yellen in the press conference said little had changed, the Fed\u2019s projections suggested that there was a notable change in the Fed\u2019s outlook.\u201d\n\nBroad Range\n\nTreasuries were little changed today, with the yield on the two-year note at 0.42 percent at 4:34 p.m. in New York and the yield on the benchmark 10-year note at 2.77 percent. The spread between yields on the two-year note and the 30-year bond, known as the yield curve, narrowed to 324 basis points today, the least on a closing basis since Feb. 3.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee said it will no longer link borrowing costs to a specific unemployment rate, saying it would instead consider a broad range of indicators on the labor market, inflation and financial markets.\n\n\u201cWe know we\u2019re not close to full employment, not close to an employment level consistent with our mandate, and unless inflation were a significant concern, we wouldn\u2019t dream of raising the federal funds rate target,\u201d Yellen said at the press conference in Washington.\n\nNew Forecasts\n\nSeparately, the Fed released new forecasts showing more officials predicting the benchmark rate, now close to zero, would rise at least to 1 percent at the end of 2015 and 2.25 percent by the end of the following year, higher than previously forecast. Those numbers are based on the median forecast of 16 Fed officials.\n\nThis month, 10 policy makers estimated the benchmark lending rate would be 1 percent or higher at the end of 2015, up from seven in December. Twelve policy makers forecast the rate would be 2 percent or higher at the end of 2016, up from eight. The total number of forecasts fell to 16 this month from 17 in December.\n\nYellen downplayed the quarterly forecasts, which are displayed as a series of dots on a chart.\n\n\u201cOne should not look to the dot-plot, so to speak, as the primary way in which the committee wants to or is speaking about policies to the public at large,\u201d she said, adding that the FOMC statement should take precedence over the forecasts.\n\nMarket Reaction\n\n\u201cShe really tried to talk it down,\u201d said Michael Hanson, senior U.S. economist at Bank of America Corp. in New York and a former Fed economist. \u201cSo I think the markets left saying, \u2018Well wait a second, what are we supposed to listen to?\u2019\u201d\n\nStock benchmarks extended declines after Yellen, responding to a question, indicated that the federal funds rate might start to rise about six months after the central bank ends its bond-purchase program.\n\nThe FOMC statement repeated that the rate will stay low for a \u201cconsiderable time\u201d after asset purchases end. Asked how long that might be, Yellen said: \u201cyou know, this is the kind of term it\u2019s hard to define, but, you know, it probably means something on the order of around six months or that type of thing.\u201d\n\nShe added that \u201cit depends on what conditions are like,\u201d and that if inflation \u201cis persistently running below our 2 percent\u201d goal, that would be \u201cvery good reason to hold the funds rate at its present range for longer.\u201d\n\nInflation measured on a 12-month basis has been below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent goal for almost two years, and prices rose just 1.2 percent for the year ending January. Still, financial markets ignored her caveat.\n\nOverhauling Guidance\n\nThe Fed is overhauling its most specific guidance ever on the benchmark lending rate after unemployment declined toward 6.5 percent, its previous threshold for a rate increase, faster than policy makers predicted.\n\n\u201cThe committee has never felt that the unemployment rate is a sufficient statistic for the labor market,\u201d Yellen said at the press conference. \u201cIt\u2019s appropriate to look at many more things, and that\u2019s why the committee now states we will look at a broad range of information.\u201d\n\nThe FOMC announced a $10 billion reduction in monthly bond-buying to $55 billion and repeated that it will taper purchases \u201cin further measured steps at future meetings.\u201d At the same time, \u201casset purchases are not on a preset course.\u201d The committee announced $10 billion reductions in purchases at the previous two meetings.\n\n\u2018Weakens Credibility\u2019\n\n\u201cGrowth in economic activity slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting adverse weather conditions,\u201d the Fed said. Even so, \u201cthere is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor-market conditions.\u201d\n\nMinneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota dissented, saying the statement \u201cweakens the credibility of the committee\u2019s commitment to return inflation to the 2 percent target from below and fosters policy uncertainty that hinders economic activity.\u201d\n\nYellen responded to the dissent in her press conference, saying the committee is \u201cfully committed\u201d to the 2 percent inflation target.\n\n\u201cWe do not want to undershoot inflation for a prolonged period of time,\u201d she said.\n\nSeventy-six percent of economists in a Bloomberg survey March 14-17 predicted the Fed would drop its unemployment threshold. Economists also predicted a $10 billion reduction in the monthly pace of bond purchases, according to the median of responses.\n\nAsset Purchases\n\nYellen, 67, took over as Fed chair last month after three years as deputy to Ben S. Bernanke. In that role, she helped shape the communications policies the Fed wielded as it sought to nurture a recovery from the worst recession since the Great Depression.\n\nAfter cutting interest rates to zero in 2008, the Fed embarked on large-scale asset purchases as well as forward guidance intended to convince investors that borrowing costs would stay low for a long time.\n\nStarting in December 2012, the FOMC said the federal funds rate would stay low at least as long as unemployment was higher than 6.5 percent and the outlook for inflation didn\u2019t exceed 2.5 percent.\n\nWith the jobless rate at 6.7 percent last month, that guidance was fast becoming obsolete.","258":"The dollar gained to the strongest level in two weeks against the euro after Federal Reserve policy makers signaled they\u2019ll probably raise interest rates by the middle of next year.\n\nThe most important business stories of the day.

The yen gained 0.3 percent to 141.07 per euro.\n\nEurope\u2019s shared currency will fall to $1.31 by year-end, the lowest since July, according to the median estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The yen will weaken to 110 per dollar for the first time since August 2008, analysts forecast.\n\nBrazilian Currency\n\nBrazil\u2019s real rallied as faster-than-forecast inflation fueled speculation the central bank will keep raising borrowing costs. The currency strengthened as much as 1.2 percent to 2.3217 per dollar before trading at 2.3279, up 0.9 percent.\n\nThe Getulio Vargas Foundation reported yesterday that Brazil\u2019s producer, construction and consumer prices rose 1.41 percent in the 20 days starting Feb. 21, more than the 1.35 percent increase forecast by economists surveyed by Bloomberg.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s rupiah led losses among the dollar\u2019s 31 most-traded counterparts after the Fed\u2019s outline on the timeframe to raise interest rates.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a broad dollar rebound after the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, and the rupiah isn\u2019t immune to that,\u201d said Irene Cheung, Singapore-based foreign-exchange strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. \u201cThe expectation for higher interest rates sooner than expected\u201d was the big surprise.\n\nThe rupiah slumped 1.2 percent to 11,445 per dollar, the biggest loss since Nov. 11.\n\nKiwi Declines\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s dollar weakened for a second day after the nation\u2019s statistics agency said gross domestic product rose 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter, versus a revised 1.2 percent during the previous three months. The kiwi fell as much as 0.7 percent to 85.02 U.S. cents before trading at 85.32 cents, down 0.3 percent.\n\nThe U.S. dollar has gained 0.8 percent in the past six months among the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen slid 2.5 percent, while the euro gained 2.9 percent.\n\nYields on Treasury two-year notes increased as much as two basis points today, or 0.02 percentage point, to 0.44 percent before closing at 0.42 percent. They climbed seven basis points yesterday, the most since 2011. Two-year German bunds yielded 0.21 percent, and comparable Japanese government bonds yielded 0.07 percent.\n\nThe policy-setting FOMC after a two-day meeting discarded a jobless-rate threshold for considering when to increase borrowing costs and said it will look at a wider range of data. The benchmark interest-rate target has been held at zero to 0.25 percent since 2008 to support the economy.\n\nRate Estimates\n\nFed officials estimated the interest rate will be 1 percent at the end of 2015 and 2.25 percent a year later. In December, they projected 0.75 percent and 1.75 percent.\n\nPolicy makers reduced monthly bond-buying by $10 billion to $55 billion and said the purchases will be slowed in \u201cfurther measured steps.\u201d Economists surveyed by Bloomberg before the meeting forecast officials would announce an end to the program in October.\n\nYellen said she saw a \u201cconsiderable time\u201d between the end of the stimulus and the first rate increase, meaning \u201caround six months or that type of thing.\u201d She spoke at a press conference after presiding over her first policy meeting.\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which monitors the U.S. currency against its 10 major counterparts, rose 0.1 percent to 1,021.54 after reaching 1,023.65, the highest since Feb. 13.

The financial firm is Bank Rossiya in St. Petersburg, which officials said has $10 billion in assets and is the 17th largest bank in Russia. Obama imposed sanctions earlier on 11 individuals.\n\nThe currency depreciated 0.5 percent to 42.5585 against Bank Rossii\u2019s target basket of dollars and euros.\n\nFrance leapfrogged the U.S. as the top destination for the Russian central bank\u2019s investments, dethroning America for the first time. The amount of reserves in French assets, including government bonds and deposits, rose to 32 percent as of June 30, a jump of 4 percentage points from three months earlier, the central bank said today in a quarterly report on its website. Bank Rossii decreased investments in the U.S. to 29.7 percent, from 33.8 percent.","259":"Bloomberg\n\nOn Wednesday, the Federal Reserve let the other shoe drop.\n\nIn a statement issued after its two-day meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee declared that it would continue to wind down its extraordinary bond buying program (\u201cquantitative easing\u201d or QEIII) by another $10 billion, so it will now buy $55 billion worth of bonds a month. That was well-telegraphed.\n\nFed lessens weight of jobless rate in guidance (14:28) WSJ Chief Economics Correspondent Jon Hilsenrath discusses the Federal Reserve's move to alter its guidance on the likely path of interest rates, putting less weight on the unemployment rate as a sign for when rate increases will start.\n\nBut then it dropped its 6.5% unemployment rate threshold for raising the federal funds rate, a target it had set in December 2012.\n\nInstead it would look at some \u201cqualitative\u201d measures, \u201cincluding measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments,\u201d the FOMC\u2019s statement said.\n\nIt added that \u201cit likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee\u2019s 2% longer-run goal\u2026\u201d\n\n(U.S. inflation rose 1.6% in the 12 months ended in January.)\n\nTranslation: The big problem with inflation now is that it\u2019s too low; reducing unemployment is the only game in town.\n\nThis move shouldn\u2019t have surprised anyone. The official unemployment rate was 6.7% in February and keeping that 6.5% target would have tied the Fed\u2019s hands before it\u2019s even finished tapering.\n\nBut even a cursory review of new Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen\u2019s work as an academic at UC Berkeley and as president and Chief Executive of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco reveals an economist whose approach may be different from those of her last three predecessors\u2014Paul Volcker, Alan Greenspan, and Ben Bernanke.\n\nWhile Volcker famously tamed runaway inflation, Greenspan presided (at least initially) over the Great Moderation, and Bernanke navigated the worst financial crisis and recession since the Great Depression, Yellen must deal with an economy that\u2019s slowly recovering, but leaving a lot of people behind.\n\nAs vice chair, Yellen helped shape Bernanke\u2019s policy, and in many ways she\u2019s continuing that. But she\u2019s likely to focus even more intently on unemployment \u2014 one half of the Fed\u2019s \u201cdual mandate\u201d \u2014 and worry about inflation later.\n\n\u201cUnlike Bernanke, whose academic focus centered on policy responses to the Great Depression and inflation targeting, Yellen is a dedicated labor economist,\u201d wrote Bloomberg economist Joseph Brusuelas.\n\n\u201cBernanke was well positioned to respond to the Great Recession via his credit easing policies; Yellen is equally well suited to the post-crisis policy challenge of the current labor slack in the economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Fed has this dual mandate focusing on the labor market and inflation,\u201d agreed Krista Schwarz, a professor of finance at The Wharton School of The University of Pennsylvania, who has studied Yellen\u2019s writings and worked for the New York Fed. \u201cWith Yellen at the helm, it might shift\u2026to a focus on labor market issues.\u201d","260":"Never miss a great news story!\n\nGet instant notifications from Economic Times\n\nAllowNot now\n\nYou can switch off notifications anytime using browser settings.","261":"Fed hints at interest rates rise\n\nUS interest rates could increase soon after the Federal Reserve hinted it is considering a change to monetary policy in the coming months.\n\nChair of the Fed Janet Yellen stated that interest rates could start to go up in the US as early as next year. Ms Yellen, who was the preferred candidate of president Barack Obama, took over the role from Ben Bernanke towards the end of 2013.\n\nAt a press conference, Ms Yellen said: \"This is the kind of term it's hard to define. Probably means something on the order of six months, or that type of thing.\"\n\nMs Yellen made her comments to reporters shortly after it was announced that the Fed said it is going to scale back bond purchases by a further $10 billion (\u00a36 billion) per month. This means it is now three times in a row that the central bank has tightened its stimulus efforts.\n\nDate of rate change\n\nBond purchases are now expected to end later this year, which would imply rate increases will start to take place at around April 2015.\n\nOvernight interest rates in the US were lowered by the Fed to zero per cent in December 2008, a move which was a response to the global financial crash, which damaged the US economy.\n\nMr Obama has overseen a recovery in the country's financial situation in the last few years, but Ms Yellen will now be looking to increase the pace of growth, while making sure it remains at a responsible and sustainable level.\n\nIn a statement released to announce its latest policy decision earlier in the month, the Fed said: \"This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labour market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.\"\n\nWhile the US looks set to increase interest rates sooner rather than later, the base rate in the UK remains at a record low of 0.5 per cent, as it has for the last five years. However, the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is reported to be mulling over a rate rise in the near future.\n\nFind up to date information on the FTSE 100 and spread betting strategies at City Index","262":"PAGE UNAVAILABLE\n\nThe document you requested either no longer exists or is not currently available.\n\nYou may use the \"Back\" button in your browser to return to the previous page or click Home to return to the WSJ.com home page.\n\nTo report this problem, contact Customer Support at support@wsj.com","263":"Error 404 - Page not found\n\nThe resource you are looking for could not be found!\n\nIt could have been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable.\n\nPlease review the URL and make sure that it is spelled correctly.","264":"Rather than take on US workers on relatively high wages, manufacturers will simply replace cheap labour in emerging markets with robots.","265":"Server Error\n\n404 - File or directory not found.

Previously the central bank had indicated that rates could rise when the unemployment rate dipped below 6.5%. The unemployment rate hit 6.7% last month but some sections of US society remain hard hit. Unemployment for black people was 12% last month, for teenagers it was 21.4%.\n\nThe Fed has now dropped the reference to the 6.5% jobless rate. Instead, the central bank said it would \u201cassess progress \u2026 toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2% inflation\u201d. The central bank has kept rates at close to zero for more than five years in an attempt to stimulate the economy in the aftermath of the recession.\n\nYellen, an expert on the labour market, has previously noted that the headline rate of unemployment can overstate the job market\u2019s health.\n\nShe said the job market was still improving and there was still sufficient signs of recovery for the Fed to continue to cut back on its quantitative easing (QE) economic stimulus programme. But she noted that some parts of the US are still suffering the worst winter weather in 30 years. \u201cUnusually harsh weather in January and February has made it especially hard to assess the underlying economy,\u201d said Yellen.\n\nApart from the disparity among various groups, in recent months the rate has fallen because many people without a job have stopped looking for one and are no longer counted as unemployed. The \u201cparticipation rate\u201d, which measures the percentage of people in the workforce, is currently at 63%, a low unseen since the 1970s.\n\nAt a press conference Yellen said the labour market was improving but that the rates of long-term unemployment and under-employment were still too high.\n\nThe 6.5% benchmark was set in December 2012 when unemployment stood at 7.8%. \u201cSince then the progress in the labour market has been more rapid than expected while inflation has been lower than expected,\u201d said Yellen. She said that rates were likely to remain close to zero for some \u201cconsiderable time\u201d after QE comes to an end.\n\n\u201cInformation received since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met in January indicates that growth in economic activity slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting adverse weather conditions,\u201d the Fed said in a statement.\n\n\u201cLabour market indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement. The unemployment rate, however, remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment continued to advance, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow.\u201d\n\nBut despite some remaining issues and the winter weather the Fed said the economy was showing \u201ccumulative progress\u201d and cut its quantitative easing (QE) economic stimulus programme by $10bn to $55bn a month. It bought $65bn in March, and $85bn last December.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s massive bond-buying programme has been intended to keep long-term borrowing rates low and spur spending. On current trends the programme will end later this year.\n\nThis article was written by Dominic Rushe in New York, for The Guardian on Wednesday 19th March 2014 19.30 Europe\/London\n\nguardian.co.uk \u00a9 Guardian News and Media Limited 2010","270":"The main event yesterday turned out to be the Federal Reserve announcement and Yellen\u2019s first press conference. The taper was completely in line with expectations \u2013 a reduction of $10bn with an equal split of $5bn from treasuries and $5bn from mortgage backed securities \u2013 but the most important thing was the expectation of rate rises. With a continuation of tapering at this rate, the Fed will be finished with QE by November this year. Yellen was at pains to continue with the line that rates will stay low for a \u2018considerable period\u2019, but then went on to put a timeline of 6 months on this, which leaves expectations for rate hikes being brought forward to second quarter 2015, in line with the expectations on from the Bank of England.\n\n\n\nOverall, the Fed has joined the BOE by going for \u201cforward suggestion\u201d \u2013 a mixture of indicators with no specific thresholds, that will hopefully show when those rises will occur. Monetary policy is unfortunately now \u201cyou\u2019ll know when we know\u201d. Though the median Fed official now expects rates of 1 per cent by the end of 2015, up from 0.75 per cent in December, the median expected at the end of 2016 has risen from 1.75 to 2.25 per cent. Yellen did say to look at the statement and that the dot chart meant almost nothing, but the market didn\u2019t care, with the US dollar making gains \u2013 albeit modestly \u2013 against all major currencies.\n\n\n\nFrom the UK yesterday morning, we saw an improvement in the February UK claimant count with a fall by 34.6k against 25k expected, with the wage data showing a small improvement in real wage growth. This wasn\u2019t enough to improve the unemployment rate which remained at 7.2% for a second month. The Bank of England MPC minutes showed the expected 9-0 vote to keep interest rates and QE on hold, but they did comment on the risks of further sterling gains to the UK economic recovery, though this was somewhat balanced by effects on effectively importing disinflation. Overall, it was all fairly sterling neutral.\n\n\n\nThe budget from George Osborne wasn\u2019t a huge giveaway, but it did look to have some electioneering with material improvements on tax treatment for savings and pensions as well tax breaks for manufacturers. And if you drive to your local bingo club on a regular basis for a couple of beers, your first round will be on George! The UK March CBI industrial trends survey is out this morning, though the news is likely to remain more interested in the details of yesterday\u2019s budget.\n\n\n\nGermany\u2019s February producer price data is scheduled for release this morning. Expect this to have fallen by 1.0%, which will be the seventh consecutive contraction. This follows euro area CPI data which showed the headline number easing to 0.7% year on year, down from its initial estimate and the 0.8% in January. Given the fact that euro CPI has been below 1% for five months, this further data makes a stronger case for further monetary easing by the ECB, but based on Governor Draghi\u2019s post meeting press conference comments earlier this month, near-term action remains unlikely.\n\n\n\nThe market will continue to digest and debate the meaning of the Fed\u2019s commentary, though this afternoon the focus will switch to US initial jobless claims data, followed later in the day by the March Philadelphia Fed survey. This is expected to have rebounded to 6.0, following January\u2019s surprise -6.3 reading, as the negative weather impact shows signs of receding. However, it is worth noting that the series tends to be volatile and also follows a weaker-than-expected Empire Fed survey earlier in the week. In addition, the release of February existing home sales today will likely show some bounce back in activity after January\u2019s weak level.","271":"Asian stocks fell sharply on Thursday as hawkish comments from new Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen took by surprise.

Reuters\n\nAt her first news conference as Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen had a message for the financial world: The U.S. economy may need several more years to fully heal from the Great Recession.\n\nWith investors around the world hanging on her words, she conveyed the calm voice of authority she's been known for in her decades as a policymaker, regulator and professor.\n\nYet, as with her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, in his news conferences, Yellen's performance wasn't quite stumble-free. Speaking of when the Fed might raise short-term interest rates from their record lows, she was surprisingly specific. Her remark appeared to muddy her overarching message that rates are bound by no single economic indicator or time frame.\n\nThe slip-up occurred as Yellen was discussing the Fed's benchmark short-term rate, which has remained at a record low near zero since 2008.\n\nThe short-term rate has remained a critical source of economic support as the Fed has recently begun paring its monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage bonds. The bond purchases have been meant to stimulate the economy by keeping long-term loan rates down.\n\nThe monthly purchases, down to $55 billion from a peak of $85 billion, are on track to stop by year's end. The Fed's short-term rate could remain near zero for a ''considerable time'' after the bond buying ends, according to the statement the central bank issued when its meeting ended Wednesday.\n\nAt her news conference, Yellen was asked to define a ''considerable time.'' Her reply: ''It probably means something on the order of around six months or that type of thing.''\n\nStocks immediately sank on her mention of ''six months'' - even though Yellen quickly stressed that a six-month time frame did not represent any commitment.\n\n''We need to see where the labor market is, how close are we to our full-employment goal,'' she cautioned. ''That will be a complicated assessment, not just based on a single statistic.''\n\nStill, her explicit mention of six months suggested that a rate hike could occur before the summer of 2015, shortly before some analysts had expected. A short-term rate increase would elevate borrowing costs and could hurt stock prices. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day down more than 100 points.\n\n''She got caught off guard,'' said Douglas Roberts, chief investment strategist at ChannelCapitalMarkets, even though Yellen explained that she was ''pretty decisively on the dovish side'' in Roberts' words - meaning she favors keeping rates low to boost the economy more than she worries about igniting inflation.\n\nFor his part, Bernanke committed a gaffe of his own last summer.\n\nAt his June news conference, Bernanke said he'd been ''deputized'' by his Fed colleagues to describe a possible path toward slowing the monthly bond purchases. Bernanke said the slowdown would likely start before year's end and be completed by mid-2014.\n\nInvestors responded in panic to the prospect that the Fed would soon reduce its support for the economy. The Dow Jones industrial average sank 560 points in two days.\n\nOn Wednesday, apart from her remark about six months, Yellen glided smoothly through her first Fed news conference. Sitting behind a desk, Yellen, 73, explained that the 4{-year-old economic recovery still needs a boost from unusually low rates.\n\nIn its statement Wednesday, the Fed dropped its previous mention of a 6.5 percent unemployment rate for considering a rate hike. The unemployment rate is now 6.7 percent.\n\nFed officials ''never felt that the unemployment rate is a sufficient statistic,'' Yellen explained.\n\nMany unemployed people have abandoned their job hunts, so they're no longer counted as unemployed, and their departures have caused the unemployment rate to drop.\n\nOthers have found part-time instead of full-time jobs. Pay growth has been depressed. And inflation remains below the Fed's target of 2 percent, a sign of weak consumer demand.\n\nCarl Tannenbaum, a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said he appreciated that Yellen was ''a bit more expansive'' than Bernanke typically was in helping explain how the Fed was viewing the economy.\n\nTannenbaum, now chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago, saw her six-month remark as something of a blip. He expects other Fed officials to try to walk back Yellen's remark in their speeches and public remarks in coming weeks.\n\nThe Fed's decision to drop a reference to 6.5 percent unemployment was supposed to mark a departure from tying a rate hike to a precise number or date.\n\nBecause the economic gains needed to raise rates have been slow to emerge, the Fed has had to frequently revise its plans for a potential increase. What was once mid-2013 turned into late 2014. Then the threshold was changed toward the end of 2012 to the unemployment rate dipping below 6.5 percent.\n\nThe Fed's decision to drop the 6.5 percent unemployment threshold ''represents the difficulty in finding the perfect economic indicator for explaining something as complex as the state of the labor market recovery and other considerations such as financial stability,'' James Marple, senior economist at TD Economics, wrote in a research note.\n\nUntil the time-frame issue suddenly resurfaced, Yellen had been making a case for why the Fed still needed to bolster the economy.\n\n''She sounded a lot more dovish than hawkish,'' said John Canally, an economist at LPL Financial. ''She spent a lot of time talking about how far away we are from full employment.''\n\nThe Fed cut its benchmark short-term rate more than five years ago to a record low near zero, where it's remained since.\n\nThe Fed also updated its economic forecasts Wednesday. Fed officials expect the U.S. economy to grow at a steady if modest pace in 2014 despite weather-related setbacks this winter. The Fed is forecasting growth of 2.8 percent to 3 percent this year, a bit lower than its December projection of between 2.8 percent and 3.2 percent.\n\nThe Fed's statement was approved on an 8-1 vote. Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Fed's regional bank in Minneapolis, cast the dissenting vote. Kocherlakota felt the changes the Fed made to its guidance on future short-term rate increases had weakened its credibility in raising inflation to the Fed's target of 2 percent.","275":"Fed taper $10bn in line with expectations\n\nExpectations of rate hikes shifted forward to Q2 15\n\nUK unemployment and wages continue to improve\n\nMPC raise concerns over sterling strength\n\nThe main event yesterday turned out to be the Federal Reserve announcement and Yellen\u2019s first press conference. The taper was completely in line with expectations \u2013 a reduction of $10bn with an equal split of $5bn from treasuries and $5bn from mortgage backed securities \u2013 but the most important thing was the expectation of rate rises. With a continuation of tapering at this rate, the Fed will be finished with QE by November this year. Yellen was at pains to continue with the line that rates will stay low for a \u2018considerable period\u2019, but then went on to put a timeline of 6 months on this, which leaves expectations for rate hikes being brought forward to second quarter 2015, in line with the expectations on from the Bank of England.\n\nOverall, the Fed has joined the BOE by going for \u201cforward suggestion\u201d \u2013 a mixture of indicators with no specific thresholds, that will hopefully show when those rises will occur. Monetary policy is unfortunately now \u201cyou\u2019ll know when we know\u201d. Though the median Fed official now expects rates of 1 per cent by the end of 2015, up from 0.75 per cent in December, the median expected at the end of 2016 has risen from 1.75 to 2.25 per cent. Yellen did say to look at the statement and that the dot chart meant almost nothing, but the market didn\u2019t care, with the US dollar making gains \u2013 albeit modestly \u2013 against all major currencies.\n\nFrom the UK yesterday morning, we saw an improvement in the February UK claimant count with a fall by 34.6k against 25k expected, with the wage data showing a small improvement in real wage growth. This wasn\u2019t enough to improve the unemployment rate which remained at 7.2% for a second month. The Bank of England MPC minutes showed the expected 9-0 vote to keep interest rates and QE on hold, but they did comment on the risks of further sterling gains to the UK economic recovery, though this was somewhat balanced by effects on effectively importing disinflation. Overall, it was all fairly sterling neutral.\n\nThe budget from George Osborne wasn\u2019t a huge giveaway, but it did look to have some electioneering with material improvements on tax treatment for savings and pensions as well tax breaks for manufacturers. And if you drive to your local bingo club on a regular basis for a couple of beers, your first round will be on George! The UK March CBI industrial trends survey is out this morning, though the news is likely to remain more interested in the details of yesterday\u2019s budget.\n\nGermany\u2019s February producer price data is scheduled for release this morning. Expect this to have fallen by 1.0%, which will be the seventh consecutive contraction. This follows euro area CPI data which showed the headline number easing to 0.7% year on year, down from its initial estimate and the 0.8% in January. Given the fact that euro CPI has been below 1% for five months, this further data makes a stronger case for further monetary easing by the ECB, but based on Governor Draghi\u2019s post meeting press conference comments earlier this month, near-term action remains unlikely.\n\nThe market will continue to digest and debate the meaning of the Fed\u2019s commentary, though this afternoon the focus will switch to US initial jobless claims data, followed later in the day by the March Philadelphia Fed survey. This is expected to have rebounded to 6.0, following January\u2019s surprise -6.3 reading, as the negative weather impact shows signs of receding. However, it is worth noting that the series tends to be volatile and also follows a weaker-than-expected Empire Fed survey earlier in the week. In addition, the release of February existing home sales today will likely show some bounce back in activity after January\u2019s weak level.","276":"WASHINGTON \u0097\u2014 Janet Yellen tried at her first news conference as Federal Reserve chairwoman to clarify a question that's consumed investors: When will the Fed start raising short-term interest rates from record lows?\n\nYellen stressed that with the job market still weak, the Fed intends to keep short-term rates near zero for a \"considerable\" time and would raise them only gradually. And she said the Fed wouldn't be dictated solely by the unemployment rate, which she feels no longer fully captures the job market's health.\n\nLogin required We have used your information to see if you have a subscription with us.

The statement also said the Fed will cut its monthly long-term bond purchases by $10 billion to $55 billion because it thinks the economy is steadily healing.\n\nBut Yellen might have confused investors when she tried to clarify the Fed's timetable for raising short-term rates. She suggested that the Fed could start six months after it halts its monthly bond purchases, which most economists expect by year's end. That would mean short-term rates could rise by mid-2015.\n\nA short-term rate increase would elevate borrowing costs and could hurt stock prices. Stocks fell after Yellen's mention of six months. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day down more than 100 points.\n\nThe Fed's latest statement said its benchmark short-term rate could stay at a record low \"for a considerable time\" after its monthly bond purchases end. The Fed has been gradually paring its bond purchases, which have been intended to keep long-term loan rates low.\n\n\"This is the kind of term it's hard to define,\" Yellen said of \"considerable time.\" \"Probably means something on the order of six months, or that type of thing.\"\n\nThough stocks sold off after that remark, the Fed's statement and Yellen's comments made clear that borrowing rates for consumers and businesses could remain low for many more months. Yellen also stressed that rate increases, once they occur, would occur only incrementally.\n\nSome analysts said they thought Yellen's reference to six months didn't really change expectations for the timing of the Fed's first rate increase.\n\n\"We're not sure the comments suggest rates would begin to rise any earlier than the mid-2015 date already priced into rate futures markets,\" Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.","277":"The page that you are looking for cannot be found.\n\nIt may be temporarily unavailable, moved or\n\ntaken off.","278":"The US Federal Reserve concluded its two day policy meeting yesterday evening - the first to be chaired by Janet Yellen since she took office last month. Investors were watching closely to see how the Fed reacted to some positive data emerging from the US economy.\n\nPhilip O'Sullivan, chief economist with Investec Ireland, says that in a \"rookie\" error, Janet Yellen suggested that US interest rates may rise as early as next Spring or about six months after the ending of the Fed massive bond-buying programme in the autumn. He said that analysts had not been expected any rise in rates until the second half of 2015 at the earliest. But he adds that while Ms Yellen did suggest a rate rise, she also said that US rates would remain low for some time to come. Her comments took markets by surprise - an opinion poll in October showed that 98% of economists believed the new Fed chief would continue her predecessor Ben Bernanke's policies and would remain dovish. But Mr O'Sullivan says not to read too much into one \"mis-step\" in the press conference and should instead focus on the prepared polished comments in the Fed's official announcement. Ms Yellen did try to row back on her comments later in the press conference, he added.\n\nThe US Fed also proceeded with its expected reductions to its bond-buying stimulus, announcing it would cut its monthly purchases of US Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to $55 billion from $65 billion. Mr O'Sullivan said the usual reliables reacted with markets in Asian lower while the announcement also impact on gold prices. But he says he feels the reaction was overdone, describing it as a knee-jerk reaction.\n\n***\n\nMORNING BRIEFS - Vidara Therapeutics, a Dublin-based pharmaceutical company which employs 24 people here, has been acquired by US firm Horizon Pharma in a deal worth over \u20ac470m. Vidara produces a number of anti-inflammatory drugs and recorded net sales of almost $59m last year. The newly merged operation - which will retain the Horizon Pharma name - will be headquartered in Dublin, which the company says will give it a \"tax efficient corporate structure\". Horizon is not the first US drug firm to repatriate to Ireland following the acquisition of a local player. Last year Perrigo moved its base to Dublin after it bought Elan for more than \u20ac6 billion.\n\n*** The Aer Arann name is set to disappear as the Irish firm plans to rebrand itself as Stobart Air. In recent years the airline has reinvented itself as a franchise operator - primarily through an agreement that sees it operate the Aer Lingus Regional service. It now hopes to expand this model by striking further franchise deals with some of Europe's larger players. The airline's new name comes from the Stobart Group - a transport company perhaps best known for its Eddie Stobart trucks - which is also the largest shareholder in the Irish carrier.\n\n*** British clothing retailer Next - which operates 29 shops in Ireland - has announced its full year results for 2013. The company saw its pre-tax profit rise by almost 12% to \u00a3695m, based on a 5% increase in revenue. Next's Directory business - which includes its website - saw the biggest gains, with that area of its business now accounting for more than a third of all revenue. There was similarly positive news coming from another British clothing firm - Ted Baker. It reported a 26.7% increase in profits in the year to the 25th January, earning \u00a340m before tax and exceptional costs.","279":"CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

Meanwhile, US bond yields surged, while the dollar strengthened against its major counterparts.\n\nIf the central bank continues to taper at the same rate over the next month months, QE should come to an end in October or November, which means that interest rates could rise as soon as April or May. Ahead of this week\u2019s meeting, analysts had widely expected a rate hike to come towards the end of 2015.\n\nWhile Yellen\u2019s comments came as a surprise to many, the message delivered about the economy was upbeat, as policymakers lowered their forecasts for unemployment which is set to fall to 6.1-6.3% by the year-end.\n\nThe Fed also adjusted its forward guidance to put less emphasis on joblessness as a goalpost for when tightening will begin. Instead \u2013 similar to Governor Mark Carney\u2019s revamped forward guidance at the Bank of England \u2013 the Fed will look at a broad range of economic indicators in their decision.\n\n\u201cWe are unquestionably going to have to get used to a world of higher interest rates next year as the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve normalise monetary policy,\u201d said Senior Analyst Angus Campbell from FxPro.\n\n\u201cEven the ECB has become less dovish after avoiding a widely expected rate cut at their last meeting,\u201d he said.\n\nNext rises, financials gain\n\nNext rose after the High Street retailer reported annual profit that met the top end of its guidance, driven by growth in online sales. The company achieved an 11.8% rise in pre-tax profit to \u00a3695m in the year through January 2014, reaching the upper range of the company\u2019s forecast of \u00a3684m-700m.\n\nFinancial stocks were performing well this morning, including RBS, Standard Chartered and HSBC. RBS was helped by an upgrade to \u2018hold\u2019 by Investec.\n\nInsurers Legal & General and Aviva were also making small gains, recovering after a sell-off yesterday on the back of a shake-up to the annuities market announced by George Osborne in his 2014 Budget.\n\nBookmakers William Hill and Ladbrokes, however, continued to fall after the Chancellor revealed an increase to the duty on fixed-odds betting terminals.\n\nManufacturing outfit Smiths Group, which yesterday disappointed with its interim results, was extending losses after HSBC lowered its rating on the stock to \u2018underweight\u2019.\n\nEngineering firm Babcock was also suffering from a downgrade by Citigroup to \u2018neutral\u2019.\n\nHeading the other way was electricity provider SSE after receiving a ratings upgrade from Morgan Stanley.

However, as the US unemployment rate quickly approaches the Fed\u2019s 6.5% unemployment target, the FOMC has taken a leaf out of the Bank of England\u2019s book by scrapping this form of forward guidance, and instead will look at a broad range of indicators and provide softer \u201cqualitative\u201d assessment on the economy. The FOMC is now saying that it \u201clikely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the Federal funds rate for a considerable time after (QE) ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee\u2019s 2 per cent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the FOMC statement revealed that the committee \u201c\u2026 currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.\n\n\u201cThe confusion has arisen from the FOMC members\u2019 projected path for the Fed\u2019s funds rate. The median member\u2019s forecast for rates at the end of 2015 is at 1%, which is more aggressive than investors had anticipated. The immediate market reaction has been negative for equities and Treasuries (higher yields). However, Janet Yellen\u2019s live news conference that followed the statement has helped to allay fears with a fairly dovish assessment. Yellen acknowledged the improvements in the economy, but was clear in communicating her intention to keeping monetary policy accommodative while inflation is below the Fed\u2019s long-term objective, and while unemployment remains high. Indeed, Yellen suggested that interest rates were likely to remain at their current 0-0.25% range until there was clear evidence that the US is close to achieving full employment, and inflation was significantly higher than it is today. Of course, the labour market is a lagging indicator of economic growth and the danger of waiting until full employment is achieved raises the risk of higher inflation, and the Fed falling behind the curve.\u201d\n\nThe Economic Voice is a Proud Supporter of the Shaftesbury Fringe\n\nFind us on the News360 app\n\nComment Here!\n\ncomments\n\nTags: federal open market committee, federal reserve, interest rates, janet yellen, News, Quantitative Easing","288":"Euro Dollar Forecast Updated: EUR-USD Looking Good for Higher Prices\n\nWe present the latest euro dollar exchange rate forecast note issued by the team at FuturesTechs.\n\nEuro Rate Today, Outlook and Forecast: The euro (Currency:EUR) remains under pressure on Thursday with the past 24 hours having belonged to the US dollar.\n\nWith no major Eurozone economic data released, the sell-off was driven entirely by demand for U.S. dollars.\n\nTraders should expect this to remain the case over the next 24 hours because the market's appetite for dollars will most surely overshadow the German producer price report.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, technically speaking, the case for further gains in EUR-USD can be found in the instrument's chart.\n\nIn their recent forecast note on the euro dollar rate, analysts at FuturesTechs say they are predicting further rises in the rate:\n\nShort Term Trend: Bullish\n\nMedium Trend: Bullish\n\nCandlestick Chart says: We have missed getting long by a few ticks for two sessions in a row now.

Bernanke went to lengths to make it known than tapering does not equal tightening but Yellen spoke about how and when rates will be increased.\n\n\"In fact there was an entire new paragraph dedicated to how the central bank will approach the removal of policy accommodation and what sent stocks plunging and the dollar soaring was Yellen's comment that the first rate will most likely be 6 months after Quantitative Easing ends,\" says Kathy Lien at BK Asset Management.\n\nAccording to Lien if the Fed maintains its current pace of tapering, asset purchases will cease in the fall, which means that the first rate hike will be in the summer of 2015.\n\nThe net result has been a bullish US dollar exchange rate complex and a weaker commodity dollar complex.\n\nWe are seeing the likes of the Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars all suffer as global investors shift funds back to the US in anticipation of better interest rates and thus yields on their investments.","290":"HONG KONG: Asian markets fell on Thursday after the head of the US Federal Reserve hinted that the central bank could raise interest rates sooner than expected.\n\nThe comments by Janet Yellen followed an expected third successive cut in the Fed's quantitative easing (QE) stimulus programme, and took markets by surprise, boosting the dollar and sending Wall Street tumbling.\n\nTokyo dropped 1.65 percent, or 238.29 points, to 14,224.23, Sydney gave up 1.15 percent, or 61.6 points, to 5,294 and Seoul fell 0.94 percent, or 18.16 points, to close at 1,919.52.\n\nShanghai closed 1.40 percent lower, giving up 28.26 points to 1993.48, while Hong Kong shed 1.79 percent, or 386.53 points to 21,182.16.\n\nEmerging markets were also hit as higher borrowing costs could see foreigners repatriating their money back to the United States.

For midday report, double-click ) SEOUL, March 20 The Indonesian rupiah led losses among emerging Asian currencies on Thursday as Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's surprisingly hawkish remarks raised expectations of an earlier U.S. rate hike and worries about more outflows from the region. Emerging Asian currencies came under further pressure as the Chinese yuan fell to a one-year low against the dollar for a record weekly loss. Investors bet on sustained weakness in the renminbi as the central bank's actions indicated it was comfortable with the downtrend. The rupiah slid on weakness in the non-deliverable forwards markets and on dollar demand from importers. The Philippine peso fell as much as 0.6 percent to 45.105 per dollar, its weakest level since Feb. 11, amid higher government bond yields after the central bank governor gave a strong hint that interest rates may be hiked soon. Thailand's baht weakened as local stocks and bonds prices fell. The Malaysian ringgit slid on proxy plays to bet on a weaker renminbi. Yellen said on Wednesday the Fed will probably end its bond-buying programme later this year and could start raising interest rates around six months later, dampening stocks and bond prices.

The benchmark Treasury yield steadied at 2.748 percent in Asian trade, after jumping 9 basis points to 2.77 percent on Thursday.\n\nStephen Gallo, a strategist with Canadian bank BMO, said there was certainly more room for the dollar to gain against its Canadian counterpart and others. It was roughly a third of a percent higher against the Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars.\n\n\"You're going to see a firmer tone for the time being,\" Gallo said.\n\n\"I would look for the dollar to remain strong against the weaker currencies. We may have more difficulty against the euro and sterling.\"\n\nThe Canadian dollar slid to a 4-1\/2 year low of C$1.1273 against its U.S. counterpart and was last at C$1.1256, while the Australian dollar fell back below 91 U.S. cents and was last at $0.9023.\n\nYUAN STILL FALLING\n\nChina's yuan plunged to a one-year low against the dollar early on Thursday after the nation's central bank set a lower guidance for the currency, largely in line with the greenback's sharp rise on the Fed surprise.\n\nIt was the yuan's second consecutive daily fall of more than 1 percent from the central bank's midpoint, after China announced over the weekend it would double its currency's permitted trading range to 2 percent.\n\nThe overnight yield spike helped the dollar index mark its biggest one-day move in over a month, to a peak of 80.111, its highest since March 6. It was last at 79.959.\n\nThe dollar bought 102.38 yen, not far from its nearly one-week high of 102.69 yen touched on Wednesday.\n\nMarkets all but ignored Yellen's emphasis that rates will stay low for a while and could end up staying lower than normal \"for some time\" even after the economy regains its health given lasting scars from the financial crisis.\n\nThat prompted some analysts to warn that this dollar rally could fade just as quickly as it began, in the days ahead.\n\n\"There may be some effort by Fed officials or sources to downplay the six-month time-frame comment,\" BNP Paribas analysts wrote in a note to clients.\n\nA Reuters poll of 17 primary dealers found 10 still expected the first hike to come in the second half of 2015, and four continued to tip 2016.\n\nYellen's remarks followed the Fed's widely expected move to reduce its monthly purchases of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to $55 billion from $65 billion.

It pared back some of the losses later to close down 4.9p, or 1 per cent, at 346.6p.\n\nLadbrokes, which had also dropped sharply in the wake of the Chancellor's speech, fell by a further 6.3p, or 4 per cent, to 134.1p.\n\nThe pensions industry has also been battered after the Chancellor gave retirees the freedom to draw down as much or as little of their pension pot as they want, removing the need to buy an annuity.\n\nFriends Life owner Resolution was the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, off by 5 per cent, or 16.9p, to 318.1p as it warned of the impact on new business flows in the individual annuity market.\n\nHowever it insisted annuities will continue to be an important product and that overall the proposals were positive for the retirement savings market.\n\nLegal & General steadied after an 8 per cent post-Budget fall as Shore Capital said that companies such as it and Prudential were likely to be beneficiaries in the long term as more people save.\n\nL&G rose 1.9p to 213.1p, Aviva added 3.3p to 493.7p, Standard Life climbed 8.7p to 362.7p and the Pru gained 9.5p to 1349p.\n\nBut Partnership Assurance, which provides enhanced annuities for people with lower life expectancies due to health and lifestyle issues -

The balance sheet is safe, we think dividends can be maintained even without energy supply profits, and EPS revisions have troughed. Capex reductions would be a positive,\u2019 analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note.\n\nBroker comment also gave a boost to taxpayer owned lender Royal Bank of Scotland, up 1.7p to 303.2p.\n\nInvestec Securities raised its rating for RBS to sell from hold following a 17 per cent drop in its share price over the three weeks since the bank posted annual results.\n\n\u2018RBS is a peculiar stock that, in our view, has a recurring tendency to benefit from irrational exuberance between financial reporting. Partly for this reason, we retain a tactical preference to be short into results, and neutral (with a positive bias) \u2018in between\u2019 when we perceive that upside risks are greater,' Investec analyst Ian Gordon said in a note.\n\nClothing retailer Next was also a strong gainer, up 115.0p to 6,695.0p after meeting expectations with an 11.8 per cent rise in annual profit, fuelled by booming sales at its online business.\n\nSome analysts, however, reckoned the scope for further gains in Next was limited, with the stock having jumped some 24 per cent this year.\n\n\u2018We view Next as a core holding, but with the shares valued at a premium to the sector, we believe the valuation is up with events,\u2019 analysts at Investec Securities said in a note.\n\n9.55: Insurers came under renewed pressure on the markets today after Chancellor George Osborne torpedoed the annuity industry in the Budget.\n\nOsborne gave pensioners the freedom to draw down as much or as little of their pension pot as they want, removing the need to buy an annuity.\n\n\n\nLegal & General fell another 2.6p to 208.6p, despite Shore Capital arguing that yesterday's 8 per cent sell-off was overdone because companies such as L&G and Prudential were likely to be beneficiaries in the long-term as more people save.\n\nFed watch: New US central bank boss Janet Yellen surprised traders by suggesting an interest rate hike could come by mid-2015\n\nPartnership Assurance, which provides enhanced annuities for people with lower life expectancies due to health and lifestyle issues, lost more than half its value yesterday and was down by another 11 per cent or 14.8p to 129.4p today.\n\nThe Budget's creation of a new \u00a315,000 super Isa has been positive for shares in fund platforms and wealth managers, with St James's Place rising by another 32p to 897.5p today.\n\n\n\nHowever, Hargreaves Lansdown fell back after surging 14 per cent yesterday - it was down 36p at 1450p.\n\nThe FTSE 100 fell 45.8 to 6,527.4, with insurers dragging on the blue chip index for the second day in a row.\n\nHowever, global markets have fallen across the board after Federal Reserve boss Janet Yellen said US interest rates could start to rise in the first half of next year.\n\n\n\nThe guidance was earlier than financial markets had been expecting and came as the Fed took another step in winding down the country's monetary stimulus push by cutting $10billion (\u00a36billion) from monthly bond purchases.\n\nThe message on rates sent Wall Street lower and the US dollar higher last night, and resulted in a weak session in Asia and falls in Europe this morning.\n\nCity commentators are mulling over the impact of Yellen's comments, including whether they were intentional or a slip of the tongue due to nerves at her first news conference as Fed boss.\n\n'Fed chair Janet Yellen spooked the markets by suggesting we could see the first hike in interest rates in the middle of 2015,' said Craig Erlam of Alpari.\n\n\n\n'Last night was a prime example of the market hearing only what it wants to hear and ignoring all of the caveats, which more often than not make the initial statement irrelevant. This mistake has been made repeatedly in the past and it appears traders have not learned from their mistakes.\n\n\n\n'A great example of this was former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke\u2019s claim last May that the Fed would taper [make cuts to its stimulus programme] 'later this year', adding that this was dependent on the strength of the economic data.\n\n\n\n'In the end, the Fed did taper in December, but investors had convinced themselves that he was hinting at September, despite the economic data at the time being below par. On this occasion they chose to ignore the caveat and a lot got burned. It will be interesting to see if history repeats itself next year.\n\n\n\nPensions shake-up: Insurers came under renewed pressure on the markets today after Chancellor George Osborne removed the need to buy an annuity\n\n'Another interesting point here is that many in the markets have assumed for a while that the first rise in interest rates could come as early as the middle of 2015, so these comments from Yellen are only in line with expectations.\n\n\n\n'Maybe a lot of the drop in the indices, and dollar rally and gold dive for that matter, can be attributed to the growing number of FOMC members that saw rates rising to 1 per cent by the end of 2015.'\n\n\n\nMichael Hewson of CMC Markets said: 'As expected the Federal Reserve last night shaved another $10billion from their monthly asset purchase programme, but it was the press conference after the initial decision which caused markets to sell-off sharply when Janet Yellen in her first post meeting press conference as Fed chair suggested about the course of interest rates that unsettled markets somewhat.\n\n\n\n'Assuming a continuation in the current pace of tapering the bond buying program looks likely to end in the fourth quarter, and in answer to a question about when interest rates might rise the Fed chief suggested that a rise in rates might come as early as the second quarter of 2015, much earlier than markets had expected.\n\n\n\n'Whether she intended to be taken so literally is open to debate but it was enough to prompt a sharp reversal, and as such we can expect to see a lower open in Europe this morning.\n\n\n\n'The Federal Reserve also dropped its unemployment threshold target of 6.5 per cent, following the example of the Bank of England, and said it would look at a wide range of factors before taking any decisions on when to move on rates.'\n\n\n\nHewson added: 'While the Fed may have intended to be dovish by downgrading growth forecasts for 2014, the fact that the committee are even speculating about raising rates just over 12 months out would suggest that they remain confident about the pace and nature of the economic recovery, despite concerns about the recent bad weather on the US economy.\n\n\n\n'This marked change of tone from previous meetings saw stocks drop, bond yields rise along with the US dollar, which hit its highest level against the euro in two weeks in the space of an hour.\n\n\n\n'If Janet Yellen had intended to make an impression in her first meeting as Fed chairwoman then she certainly succeeded yesterday, begging the question as to whether she intended to come across as hawkish as she did.'\n\n\n\nJonathan Sudaria of Capital Spreads said: 'Overnight at the Federal Open Market Committee press conference, after a very dovish statement, when pressed about rate hikes, Yellen spluttered out a date of possibly six months after the end of tapering.\n\n\n\n'Blindly, everyone has calculated that with tapering at $10billion a month, six months after that would be mid 2015. However, this doesn\u2019t tally with the tone of the words of the statement and one wonders if a bit of stage fright took hold of her in front of the glare of the cameras for the first time.\n\n\n\n'After removing the 6.5 per cent unemployment threshold to allow loose monetary conditions to persist even longer, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to then blind side markets with the threat of an imminent rate hike nearer than anyone had forecast. Expect regional Fed members to be doing the media circuit trying to finesse what she actually meant.'\n\n\n\n8.55: The FTSE 100 opened down 30.9 points at 6,542.2, tracking a drop in global equities after the US Federal Reserve signalled it could raise interest rates much sooner than expected.\n\nNew central bank boss Janet Yellen sent US stocks and bonds tumbling after suggesting that interest rates could rise by mid-2015, pointing to a more aggressive push towards normalising the cost of borrowing than anticipated.\n\nYellen cut the Fed's bonding buying stimulus programme by a further $10billion to $55billion a month, and suggested it could be wound up entirely by this autumn.\n\nMarket watch: Traders were rattled by Fed boss Janet Yellen's suggestion of aggressive moves towards normalising US interest rates\n\nThe Fed sought to help the US recover from the financial crisis by launching a vast stimulus scheme, which generated plentiful cheap money that has boosted stock markets all over the world in recent years.\n\nIts gradual withdrawal, which began last December, has prompted investors to pull money out of emerging markets and caused volatility across many other asset classes.\n\nThe US Dow Jones index slid 114 points to finish at 16,222.2 yesterday, while Japan's Nikkei fell 187 points to close at 14,224.2 overnight.\n\nYellen's comments were made after the European market close, but the FTSE 100 closed 32.15 points lower at 6,573.13 yesterday following the Budget.\n\nInsurers' shares took a hit after Chancellor George Osborne's announcement that no one will have to buy an annuity in future if they don't want one.\n\n\n\nBookmakers slumped due to a hike in tax on fixed odds betting machines from 20 per cent to 25 per cent.\n\nStocks to watch today include:\n\nNEXT: The clothing retailer met guidance with a 11.8 per cent rise in annual profit, driven by growth at its Directory internet and catalogue business.\n\nGLAXOSMITHKLINE: The pharmaceutical company said it was disappointed by some of the results of a stage III trial for a lung cancer treatment but would continue with it as there could still be a group of patients who may benefit.\n\nLLOYDS: The part-nationalised bank said it had sold a real estate loan portfolio for \u20ac280million.\n\nARM: The firm expects the value of ARM-based chips in smartphones and mobile computing application processors to reach $20billion by 2018 from $13billion last year.\n\nUNITED UTILITIES: The company said it was expecting higher operating profits for 2013-2014.\n\nPREMIER FARNELL: The distributor of small electronics and electronic parts reported an 8 per cent rise in full-year pre-tax profit, helped by strong sales in emerging markets in the second half of the year.\n\nMULBERRY: Bruno Guillon quit as chief executive less than two months after the luxury fashion company issued a major profit warning which hammered its shares.\n\nCREST NICHOLSON: The housebuilder said forward sales for 2014 and beyond were up by 50 per cent compared with last year.\n\nBP: The oil giant rejoined bidders for exploration and production leases in the Gulf of Mexico and won 24 tracts after the US government lifted a 16-month ban barring it from new federal contracts.\n\nROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND: The bank must face a US lawsuit seeking to force it to cover losses suffered by a bond insurer on a $1.15billion securities offering backed by allegedly defective and fraudulent home loans.\n\nM&C SAATCHI: The advertising agency said full-year profit rose 8 per cent as it brought new clients on board and won new contracts from existing clients.","296":"US stocks were sent lower yesterday thanks to Yellen's suggestion that the Fed may start to hike interest rates as early as April 2015. No exact timeline was given, but the Fed's Chairman wasn't coy when asked how long the Fed would wait until after the QE tapering ends before they start to raise interest rates. Instead of reverting to type and say generic terms, Yellen actually quantified the period to \"around six months\" even though she wasn't pressed to give a more specific time frame. Assuming that Fed continues to cut QE purchases by $10 Billion each in the next 5 meetings, we would reach the end of QE in October, that would mean the 1st rate hike may happen during the 2015 April meeting. If the pace of decline in QE is faster, and if Yellen's 6 months is relatively flexible we could even see a rate hike at the end of 2014 or at the start of 2015. No matter how you cut it, this new guidance is earlier than the previous estimate of mid 2015.\n\nHence, it is not surprising to see Stock prices tanking lower heavily following this news, as market has been heavily doped up by hyper-low interest rates and the prospect of higher borrowing costs will affect traders who are using high leverage right now - and they represent a large proportion of the market if record margin debt levels shown in US exchanges are anything to go by.\n\nHourly Chart\n\nS&P 500 Hourly\n\n\n\nHowever, prices did not really drop that significantly. S&P 500 only shed 0.61%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average is lower by 0.70%, while Nasdaq 100 fell by 0.64%. This is by no means the largest decline that we've seen in recent days, and the failure of risk sensitive Nasdaq 100 to fall the greatest suggest that risk appetite hasn't really disintegrated. From a price action perspective, S&P 500 remains above the 1,850 key support, and seeing how prices rebounded quickly when 1,850 was tagged, it is clear that there are bulls seeking bargain buys which will keep prices supported for now.\n\nThat being said, the failure to climb above 1,860 resistance is worrying, and right now prices are starting to head lower once again - in line with Asian stocks that are bearish right now. This suggest that a move back towards 1,850 is possible once again, but breaking below may be difficult considering that Stochastic readings should be Oversold when 1,850 is reached. Nonetheless, the support level is not invincible and should risk off appetite spread to the European session and back to US session once again it is possible for prices to go all the way back to last week's low.\n\nDaily Chart\n\nS&P 500 Daily\n\nThe same could be said for Daily Chart. Uptrend is still in play, echoed by Stochastic curve that is pointing higher right now. However, Stoch levels are at a \"resistance zone\" between 50.0 - 60.0 and it is still possible for Stoch curve to reverse here. Hence, traders who wants to play on the rebound should wait for stronger confirmation that 1,850 has held before committing heavily.\n\nOn the fundamentals side of things, it should be noted that for all the panic that Yellen's comments caused, a shift of schedule earlier by 2 months isn't really that significant in the bigger scheme of things. The largest impact it should have is on short-term speculators. As there isn't any important news today or tomorrow, the surprise hawkish talk by Yellen is expected to play on in the next 2 days. Hence, if stock prices started to show signs of bullishness today or tomorrow, the likelihood of market shrugging off Yellen's comments will be higher and we could see even stronger recovery next week if confidence is back in play.\n\nOriginal post","297":"PAGE UNAVAILABLE\n\nThe document you requested either no longer exists or is not currently available.\n\nYou may use the \"Back\" button in your browser to return to the previous page or click Home to return to the WSJ.com home page.\n\nTo report this problem, contact Customer Support at support@wsj.com","298":"cna.not.found.respheadline\n\nThe page you are looking for could not be found.\n\nYou may also like to try the following pages:\n\nAlternatively, you may like to do a search:","299":"The new Federal Reserve chairman, Janet Yellen, sent Wall Street sliding last night in her first public outing since taking on the role as she said interest rates could start to rise about six months after quantitative easing comes to an end.\n\nHer comments undid much of the Federal Open Markets Committee's earlier dovish statement that said it would consider a far broader range of economic indicators than just unemployment before hiking borrowing costs. Namely, the committee will consider inflation expectations among other factors.\n\nAsked when the rate-setting committee would start raising rates after QE, Ms Yellen said: \"So the language that we use in the statement is 'considerable period'. This is the kind of term it's hard to define but probably means something on the order of around six months, or that type of thing.\"\n\nOn those words, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell sharply, ending the session down 114 points at 16,222.\n\nAnalysts said that suggested, at the current pace of tapering out QE, rates would start to rise in about April 2015.\n\nHowever, her overall comments were far from those of an out-and-out hawk.\n\nShe added: \"What the statement is saying is it depends what conditions are like \u2026 The new guidance does not indicate any change in the policy intentions of the FOMC, but instead reflects changes in the conditions we face \u2026 progress in the labour market has been more rapid than we anticipated \u2026 Inflation matters here too. If we have a substantial shortfall in inflation, if inflation is persistently running below our 2 per cent objective, that is a very good reason to hold the funds rate at its present range for longer.\"\n\nThe rapid improvement in the jobless rate in the US has wrongfooted the Fed just as Britain's has caught out the Bank of England and its Governor, Mark Carney, who had to rewrite his own guidance which had been based around a 7 per cent unemployment threshold. Mr Carney set that target last August when unemployment was at 7.8 per cent. It has since plummeted to 7.2 per cent, where figures yesterday showed it had held for a second consecutive month.\n\nSpeaking after the Yellen conference, Brian Jacobson, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management, said: \"The forward guidance is mildly hawkish. Yellen is no dove. She's a pragmatist.\"\n\nOnce rates do eventually start to rise, Fed officials see slightly sharper increases than they did in December, with rates ending 2015 at 1 per cent and ending 2016 at 2.25 per cent, according to forecasts by Fed policymakers. In December, Fed officials expected short-term rates to be just 1.75 per cent by the end of 2016.\n\nOf the Fed's 16 policymakers, only one believes it will be appropriate to raise rates this year, according to Reuters, while 13 expect a first rate hike in 2015, and two others see the first rate rise happening in 2016.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Fed said the US economic recovery was strong enough for the central bank to continue reducing its bond-buying stimulus measures by $10bn (\u00a36bn) a month.\n\nThese monthly purchases of mortgage-backed and Treasury securities have boosted markets and helped to keep interest rates low.\n\nBeginning in April, the Fed will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $25bn a month rather than $30bn a month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $30bn a month rather than $35bn a month.","300":"Dear readers, we are excited to announce that the Voice of Russia has changed its name and moved over to a new website.

Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here\n\nJanet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s new chairwoman, said at a news conference after the statement\u2019s publication that the Fed would not be overly influenced by the unemployment rate, which Yellen believes overstates the health of the economy.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this change is simply to provide more information than we have in the past, even though it is qualitative information, as the unemployment rate declines below 6.5 percent,\u201d Yellen said.\n\nYellen responded to a separate question by defining \u201ca considerable time\u201d as \u201csix months, that kind of thing,\u201d suggesting a first rate increase could come in spring 2015, earlier than market expectations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a separate set of forecasts, also published Wednesday, Fed officials consolidated around the view that short-term rates would rise next year.\n\nThe steady course of Fed policy reflected the confidence of officials that the economy continues to recover from the Great Recession. The statement said that \u201cgrowth in economic activity slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting adverse weather conditions.\u201d But it added that the Fed regarded its current efforts as sufficient to produce gradual improvement in the economy, lower unemployment, and a low pace of inflation.\n\nEven so, Yellen noted that many Fed officials no longer expected a complete recovery. Their economic predictions reflect a growing expectation that the Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate will remain below its historical norm even after unemployment and inflation have returned to equilibrium.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of headwinds from the crisis that have taken a very long time to dissipate and are likely to continue being operative,\u201d she said.\n\nPredictions that the economy would grow more quickly in 2014 have not come true. Cold weather and winter storms in some parts of the country appear to have suppressed economic activity. Car sales, for example, fell sharply in January in the coldest parts of the country, according to a recent analysis. But it is not clear whether the difficult winter is a complete explanation. Growth has repeatedly fallen short of the Fed\u2019s expectations in recent years, and officials have said that judging the impact of the cold will take time \u2014 and warmer weather.\n\nThe labor market remains weak. The share of adults with jobs has barely increased since the recession, and many people have stopped looking for work, driving the decline in the official unemployment rate.\n\nInflation also remains sluggish. The Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation rose just 1.1 percent during the 12 months that ended in January, well below the 2 percent annual pace the Fed has established as its target. Officials see this as a symptom of the broader economic malaise and expect inflation to increase alongside the economy. But the Fed in recent months has communicated growing concern about the trend, highlighting in policy statements that it will act if necessary to raise inflation back to a healthier pace.\n\nYet Fed officials remain optimistic about growth in the second half of the year.\n\nForecasts published Wednesday showed few changes, in comparison with the last forecasts in December. Officials expect slightly softer growth and a slightly faster decline in the official unemployment rate. The forecast now predicts growth no faster than 3 percent in 2014, compared with a December forecast of up to 3.2 percent; unemployment is predicted to fall as low as 6.1 percent, rather than 6.3 percent.\n\nThose two trends normally move in opposite directions. But economic weakness since the Great Recession has steadily reduced the unemployment rate by leading people without jobs to stop looking for work.\n\nFed officials now forecast that the unemployment rate in 2016 will reach a new equilibrium between 5.2 and 5.6 percent, meaning they do not believe the rate can be further reduced without precipitating inflation. That is about a percentage point higher than the prerecession rate.\n\nThe Fed also faces concerns about the financial markets. The Fed is trying to strike a balance between encouraging risk taking and preventing the kinds of excesses that could produce a financial crisis.\n\nYellen and other senior Fed officials have said repeatedly that they are watching closely and see little reason for alarm.\n\n.","305":"\u2022 USD holds onto post-FOMC gains\n\n\u2022 Yellen indicates QE3 exit as early as October\n\n\u2022 FTSE, DAX, CAC all expected to open sharply negative\n\nForex Overnight: USD trading mostly flat\n\n\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\n\n\nThe USD is trading flat against most of its major counterparts this morning, holding yesterday\u2019s gains triggered by the US Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to continue tapering its monthly bond buying programme.

The Federal Open Market Committee raised its employment outlook, forecasting that the unemployment rate will fall to a range of 6.1 percent to 6.3 percent by the end of 2014 and as low as 5.6 percent in 2015.The Fed chairperson, Janet Yellen, has indicated that the central bank may end its massive bond-buying programme in October or December, while the first interest rate hike could take place around six-months later, depending on the nation\u2019s economic recovery.On an annual basis, New Zealand\u2019s gross domestic product has expanded 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, in line with market expectations and compared to a downwardly revised rise of 3.3 percent posted in the previous quarter.\n\nEconomic calendar\n\nCountry GMT Economic Indicator Relevance Consensus\/\n\n*Actual Previous Frequency Japan 07:00 Convenience Store Sales (YoY) (Feb) Low - -0.10% Monthly Switz-erland 07:00 Exports (MoM) (Feb) Low - 2.50% Monthly Switz-erland 07:00 Imports (MoM) (Feb) Low - -2.30% Monthly Switz-erland 07:00 Trade Balance (Feb) Medium CHF 2.24 bn CHF 2.59 bn Monthly Germany 07:00 Producer Price Index (MoM) (Feb) Medium 0.10% -0.10% Monthly Germany 07:00 Producer Price Index (YoY) (Feb) Medium -0.90% -1.10% Monthly Japan 07:15 BoJ Governor Kuroda Speaks at JCCI Medium - - - Switz-erland 08:30 SNB Interest Rate Decision High 0.00% 0.00% - Italy 10:00 Current Account (Jan) Low - EUR 1.85 bn Monthly UK 11:00 CBI Industrial Trends Survey - Orders (Mar) Low 5.00 3.00 Monthly UK 11:00 CBI Trends Selling Prices (Mar) Medium - 17.00 Monthly US 12:30 Continuing Jobless Claims (08-Mar) Low 2880.00 K 2855.00 K Weekly US 12:30 Initial Jobless Claims (15-Mar) Medium 322.00 K 315.00 K Weekly US 14:00 Existing Home Sales (Feb) Medium 4.60 mn 4.62 mn Monthly US 14:00 Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Survey (Mar) Medium 3.20 -6.30 Monthly US 14:00 Leading Indicator (MoM) (Feb) Medium 0.20% 0.30% Monthly US 14:00 Existing Home Sales (MoM) (Feb) Medium -0.40% -5.10% Monthly Eurozone 15:00 ECB's Lautenschlaeger on Panel in Dusseldorf Low - - - US 20:00 Fed Releases Dodd-Frank Act Supervisory Stress Test Results High - - - Eurozone - European Council Meeting High - - -\n\n\n\nSee today's events updated in real-time in our Financial Calendar on TradingFloor.com\n\n\n\nCorporate Calendar","306":"The dollar jumped sharply overnight after the more hawkish then expected FOMC announcement. Dollar index rose to as high as 80.11, comparing to last week's low of 79.27 and is now trying to defend 80 handle. Treasury yield also responded positively with 30 year yield back at 3.67 and 10 year yield rose to 2.772. On the other hand, stocks responded negatively with Dow closed down -114 pts, or -0.7%. S&P 500 dropped -11.48 pts, or -0.61%. Gold seemed to have faced strong resistance below 1400 and extended its fall from recent high of 1396.2 to as low as 1326.1 so far. In the currency markets, the dollar is strongest against Canadian dollar which was evident in the strong break of 1.1223 key near term resistance level. Meanwhile, the next weakest were the Swiss Franc and Japanese Yen.\n\nThe FOMC's March meeting turned out to be more hawkish than expected. Besides announcing a further reduction of monthly asset purchase by USD10B, policymakers have pushed forward the tightening cycle and upgraded the labor market outlook. The Fed also modified its forward guidance, removing the thresholds of 6.5% unemployment rate and 2.5% inflation rate. The central bank, however, stressed that 'the change in the Committee's guidance does not indicate any change in the Committee's policy intentions as set forth in its recent statements'.\n\nThe central bank pushed forward the expected pace of its rate hike cycle, forecasting the Fed funds rate would rise to 1.0% at the end of 2015 and 2.25% at the end of 2016. We believe the change was mainly driven by the more upbeat outlook in the labor market. Also, the fed lowered its unemployment rate projections, forecasting the jobless rate to reach 6.1-6.3% this year, down from 6.3-6.6% previously estimated, before falling to 5.6-5.9% in 2015, compared 5.8-6.1% previous projected, and 5.2-5.6% in 2016, compared with 5.3-5.8% projected previously. Meanwhile, the Fed lowered the mid-point for real GDP growth by one-tenth to 2.9%, 3.1% and 2.8% in 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively. Headline and core inflation forecasts were little changed.\n\nIn the post meeting press conference, Fed chair Yellen suggested that rate hike could come around six months after the monthly bond purchase program ends. Yellen tried to quantify the term \"considerable time\" as Fed pledged to keep rates low for \"considerable time\" after the asset purchase program. And Yellen said that while it's \"hard to define\", it could \"probably means something on the order of around six months\". Fed is expected to continue to taper the asset purchase by USD 10b at each FOMC meeting, which would end by the end of the year. Hence, Fed could indeed start to raise rate as soon as next Spring.\n\nElsewhere, New Zealand GDP grew 0.9% qoq in Q4 as expected. SNB rate decision will be a major focus today and is expected to keep policy unchanged, and maintain the pledge to keep the floor. Swiss will also release trade balance. Germany will release PPI and UK will release CBI trends total orders. US will release jobless claims, Philly Fed survey, existing home sales and leading indicators.","307":"Shares on Wall Street slid last night after new Federal Reserve chairman Janet Yellen said interest rates could start to rise about six months after quantitative easing (QE) comes to an end.\n\nHer comments on her first public outing since taking the role undid much of the Federal Open Markets Committee's earlier statement that said it would consider a far broader range of economic indicators than just unemployment before hiking borrowing costs.\n\nIt had indicated the committee will consider inflation expectations among other factors.\n\nAsked when the rate-setting committee would start raising rates after QE, Yellen said: \"So the language that we use in the statement is 'considerable period'. This is the kind of term it's hard to define but probably means something on the order of around six months, or that type of thing.\"\n\nOn those words, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell sharply, ending the session down 114 points at 16,222.\n\nAnalysts said that suggested, at the current pace of tapering out QE, rates would start to rise in about April 2015.\n\nHowever, her overall comments were far from those of an out-and-out hawk.\n\nShe added: \"What the statement is saying is it depends what conditions are like \u2026 The new guidance does not indicate any change in the policy intentions of the FOMC, but instead reflects changes in the conditions we face \u2026 progress in the labour market has been more rapid than we anticipated \u2026 Inflation matters here too.\n\n\u201cIf we have a substantial shortfall in inflation, if inflation is persistently running below our two per cent objective, that is a very good reason to hold the funds rate at its present range for longer.\"\n\nThe rapid improvement in the jobless rate in the US has wrongfooted the Fed just as Britain's has caught out the Bank of England and its Governor, Mark Carney, who had to rewrite his own guidance which had been based around a seven per cent unemployment threshold.\n\nCarney set that target last August when unemployment was at 7.8 per cent. It has since plummeted to 7.2 per cent, where figures yesterday showed it had held for a second consecutive month.\n\nSpeaking after the Yellen conference, Brian Jacobson, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management, said: \"The forward guidance is mildly hawkish.

And what could it look like?\n\nThe Fed has expanded its balance sheet by a factor of four over the past few years as a result of quantitative easing, from a little less than $1 trillion to around $4 trillion today.\n\nThe quadrupling of the US monetary base has not sparked off high inflation there, though there has been collateral damage in several emerging market economies such as India that have had to battle appreciating currencies as well as asset price bubbles in 2010 and 2011.\n\nA meaningful return to normal monetary policy in the US should mean that the Fed will have to cut the size of its balance sheet at some point of time if it is to avoid inflationary consequences of its monetary expansion once its economy recovers. The current plan to trim monthly asset purchases by the Fed only means that the monetary base in the US is growing at a slower pace. In other words, its monetary policy is still very much in expansion mode.\n\nThe end game could be an actual reduction in the size of the Fed balance sheet though perhaps not all the way down to its level before the financial crisis.\n\nIt is hard right now to assess whether this will actually happen and also what such an eventual reduction in the US monetary base could mean to the global economy. But financial markets will need to start asking the hard question at some point of time. Policymakers in emerging markets will also have to be on alert in case a monetary contraction in the US unsettles global capital flows.\n\nThe US was one of the signatories to the global plan for recovery agreed by the G-20 nations in London in April 2009. One part of the joint statement by the leaders of these countries said: \u201cWe will conduct all our economic policies cooperatively and responsibly with regard to the impact on other countries and will refrain from competitive devaluation of our currencies and promote a stable and well-functioning international monetary system.\u201d\n\nAs it exits its monetary stimulus, the US is in effect dumping this agreement to consider the impact of policy on other countries. The recent reaction in the financial markets to the taper has been benign compared to the panic in several emerging markets after then Fed chairman Ben Bernanke first spoke about a taper in May 2013. But there could be turbulence in the quarters ahead as the US reduces its pace of monetary expansion, raises policy interest rates and then perhaps begins to toy with the idea of an actual monetary contraction.\n\nThis article has been modified from its previous version to reflect a change in emerging market currency appreciation.","312":"America is not expected to raise interest rates until next year, after US Federal Reserve chairman Janet Yellen said the central bank would stop using unemployment as a target to determine rate increases and set out a potential timetable for the change.\n\nThe Fed has spent the past two years telling markets it will increase interest rates only once unemployment falls below 6.5pc, but on Wednesday it abandoned that target and offered a much more nuanced form of \u201cforward guidance\u201d.\n\nIn its first press conference with Ms Yellen as chairman, the Federal Open Market Committee instead promised to \u201cassess progress\u2026towards its objectives of maximum employment and 2pc inflation\u201d.\n\nIt also pledged to continue to slow its bond-buying programme, saying it would cut it by $10bn to $55bn a month from April.\n\nHowever, the biggest news came as the Fed said it is likely to keep interest rates unchanged for a \u201cconsiderable time\u201d after it winds up its bond-buying scheme altogether. Mrs Yellen later clarified this period as around \u201csix months\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase programme ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the committee\u2019s 2pc longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored,\u201d the committee said.\n\nThe Fed is expected to end its bond-buying scheme in the autumn, as long as the economy improves, suggesting that an interest rate rise would come in spring 2015 at the earliest.\n\nThe central bank stressed that the shift in its language did not necessarily translate to a policy change, and restated its usual caveats that tapering is \u201cnot on a pre-set course\u201d. However, investors still interpreted the statements as confirmation the Fed is paving the way for an a rate increase, with most analysts pointing to a rise in 2015.\n\nThe Dow Jones index fell on the announcements, dropping more than 200 points to 16,126, but subsequently made up some of these losses and was at 16,222 in late trading.\n\nHowever, investors seemed more comfortable with the news than during previous Fed conferences chaired by Mrs Yellen\u2019s predecessor, Ben Bernanke. Markets were wildly volatile during his last six months as chairman as investors pored over his remarks for signs the Fed was about to start tapering.\n\nMrs Yellen reassured investors the Fed would make its decisions based on a reasonable volume of data, rather than in a reactionary manner.\n\nShe admitted the central bank \u201cprobably overdid the optimism\u201d in its assessment of the economy in January, but that its views for the quarter from December to March were pretty much \u201cunchanged\u201d.\n\nThe Fed is keen for traders to fall into line with its forecasts because if markets begin to price in earlier rate rises, this could cause tighter financial conditions that may deter the investment and hiring that the Fed wants to promote.\n\nMany Fed officials, including Mrs Yellen, have attributed recent weak economic data to the harsh winter and believe warmer weather will improve economic performance.","313":"James Clunie talks about how resilience is not just one dimension but should be apparent in the investment process, the emotional temperament of the fund manager and communication between manager and client.","314":"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday downplayed the unemployment rate as a guide to the U.S. economy's health. But Janet Yellen, the new Fed chair, didn't leave investors in the dark.\n\nInstead, she listed five gauges that make up her ''dashboard'' for tracking the economy. She also specified, in some cases, when those measures would signal a healthy economy.\n\nThe issue arose because Fed policymakers, like many economists, worry that the unemployment rate might be overstating the health of the economy. The rate has fallen by a full percentage point in the past year. But much of the drop occurred because fewer Americans are working or looking for work. The government doesn't count people as unemployed unless they're actively searching for jobs.\n\nFor those who want to track the economy along with Yellen, here are the items she listed during a news conference Wednesday, her first as Fed chair:\n\n- THE U-6:\n\nIt might sound like the name of an Irish rock band. But it's a broader measure of the job market. It includes not only the unemployed but also those working part time who would prefer full-time work and those who have stopped searching for jobs. Last month, the U-6 rate was 12.6 percent, much higher than the unemployment rate of 6.7 percent. Yellen said the number of Americans forced to work part time is ''unusually large.'' It suggests that she believes the Fed could do more to boost the economy.\n\n- LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED:\n\nOne particularly brutal aspect of the Great Recession and its aftermath is that millions of laid-off people have struggled to find jobs. In April 2010, 45 percent of the unemployed had been out of work for six months or longer, a record. This proportion has since declined to 37 percent. But that's still far higher than the pre-recession figure of just 17 percent. Yellen said it ''has been immensely high and can be very stubborn'' to bring down.\n\n- LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION RATE:\n\nThis measure is critical to evaluating the job market's health. It tracks how many people are either working or looking for work. In December, it fell to its lowest level in 35 years before recovering slightly. More retirements by baby boomers account for much of the drop. But Yellen said this rate has also fallen because some of the unemployed have given up looking for work. They could start searching again as the economy improves. If so, they could push up the unemployment rate.\n\nMalaysia Airlines Flight MH370: Artworks convey hope\n\n- QUITTING AND HIRING:\n\nIn a healthy economy, more Americans quit their jobs. That's because they either have a new job - usually with higher pay - or they're confident they can find another. That makes quitting a reliable measure of the job market's health. The government also tracks the overall number of people hired each month. That's separate from the net increase in jobs included in each month's employment report, because a strong net job gain can reflect mainly very few layoffs. Yellen wants to see whether employers are actively adding workers. The number of people quitting jobs has partly recovered from the recession. But Yellen noted that hiring ''remains extremely depressed.''\n\n- WAGE GROWTH:\n\nYellen highlighted what everyone who has gone without a decent raise for several years knows: ''Wage growth has really been very low.'' Average pay is rising at a 2 percent annual pace, before inflation, she said - well below the 3 percent to 4 percent rate she cited as typical of a healthy economy.\n\nMany of these indicators point to a weaker job market than the unemployment rate would suggest. That's probably why Yellen said the economy is ''not close to full employment,'' despite the steady decline in the unemployment rate.\n\nBut her assessment wasn't all gloomy. The ''dial on virtually all of those things is moving in a direction of improvement,'' she said.\n\nAlso check:\n\n* Live: BSE Sensex\n\n* Check prices: All Models","315":"\u2022 Fed cuts tapering by USD 10bn to USD 55bn\n\n\u2022 Unemployment threshold rate of 6.5% jettisoned\n\n\u2022 EURUSD relatively stable in FOMC aftermath\n\nThe first meeting of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Open Market Committee (FOMC) with the new chairwoman, Janet Yellen, concluded yesterday. At 18:00 GMT the statement was released, together with updated economic projections, and at 18:30 GMT Yellen faced journalists in the press conference.\n\nMonthly purchases decreased by USD 10 billion\n\nThe FOMC decided to continue tapering its monthly-asset purchases. Beginning from April, the monthly purchases will be lowered by USD 10 billion to USD 55 billion. The Fed has indicated for a while and many times that it will stop the asset purchases before the year is over, and that the aim is to decrease the purchases at every FOMC meeting by the same amount.\n\nUnemployment threshold jettisoned\n\nSince December 2012, the forward guidance has pledged that rates would remain low as long as inflation is at 2.5 percent or less and as long as the unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent. As the unemployment rate hit a low of 6.6 percent last January, the guidance was hardly relevant. The Fed knows very well that the low unemployment rate paints a rather optimistic view of the labour market. Participation rate remains historically low and the number of people working part-time jobs for economic reasons is high, so the economy is far from full employment, or levels where the employment would cause inflationary pressures.\n\nInstead of presenting new quantitative thresholds, the Fed stated that it will weigh \u2018wide range of information\u2019. This is actually the same as having no forward guidance at all. While this move toward traditional qualitative guidance was expected, it also makes analysts\u2019 work harder as now they will have to estimate the economic variables and the Fed\u2019s interpretation of those variables.\n\nConnecting the dots: rate hikes in 2015\n\nWithout any concrete guidance, analysts looked at the economic projections and noticed that the majority of the FOMC saw the Federal funds rate reaching one percent by the end of 2015. Yellen tried to belittle the dot chart\u2019s importance and that economist\u2019s should concentrate on the FOMC statement for guidance. As the statement said that rates would remain low for a \u201cconsiderable time\u201d after asset purchases end, Yellen answered that it would \u201cprobably mean\u201d around six months. Tapering is planned to be complete by the end of 2014, so the expected time frame is pretty clear.\n\n\n\nSource: Federal Reserve\n\nView: hawkish now, dovish later?\n\nThe initial reaction was that the FOMC was more hawkish than expected. The chart, which I bravely posted before the event, shows that EURUSD has for the past year tended to fall after the FOMC, as expectations of \u201cmonetary candy\u201d have built up, but the Fed has not delivered. This is again quite a similar situation. The end result was pretty much what was expected, but the dot plot and the lack of concrete guidance have led to a deflation of those ballooned hopes. After a while, markets will begin concentrating on the lack of concrete guidance, and then hopes will begin building up again.\n\nThe next key event will be the European Central Bank\u2019s meeting on April 4, and as the same chart shows, the ECB-days have often been followed by a surging EURUSD. That has been the story of the EURUSD for some time now grinding slowly higher, but at the same time oscillating between Fed-highs and ECB-lows. Should the EURUSD remain bearish until the ECB-meeting, a visit lower towards channel bottoms could be on the cards. Short-term, the pair is sitting at the major support level of 1.3820, the highs from last October and December, and could see a bounce to perhaps 1.3850 or so.\n\n\n\nSource: Saxo Trader\n\n\n\nSource: Saxo Trader\n\n\n\nSource: Saxo Trader\n\nReactions: bond yields, USD surged, while stock plummeted\n\nThe futures market prices the first 25bps rate hike to happen in September 2015.

At her first press conference as newly-appointed Fed Chair, Janet Yellen exploded the myth that she would be a \u201cdovish\u201d leader of the central bank, as she explained that the Fed could begin to raise the federal funds rate from its current 0 \u2013 0.25 percent range approximately 6 months after the Fed\u2019s bond-buying program ends in the fall.\n\nDespite the fact that New York Fed Chair Bill Dudley indicated on March 7 that increases to the federal funds rate would likely begin at some point in mid-2015, investors seemed shocked to hear a similar statement from Dr. Yellen, as a stock selloff immediately ensued.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) lost 114 points to finish Wednesday\u2019s trading session at 16,222 for a 0.70 percent decline.

There are many underwater mortgage holders,\" she observed.\n\n\"The difficulties, therefore, in gaining access to credit, for example from equitable lines of credit, for some that makes it difficult to finance small businesses. Mortgage credit is very difficult for those still to get without pristine credit scores.\"\n\nEthan Harris, an economist at Bank of America, says Janet Yellen's caution is well placed.\n\n\"You had a major bank and real estate crisis, you've had damaged balance sheets. The main effect of low interest rates from the Fed up until now has been balance sheet repair. Everyone's refinanced, banks are in better shape, the household sector is in better shape,\" he said.\n\n\"That repair process has distracted attention I think from growth. The hope is that the repair process is now well advanced and we can start seeing some better growth out there.\"\n\nJanet Yellen has another big proviso for pushing US rates higher.\n\nInflation in the United States is stuck at 1.2 per cent - compared to Australia's 2.6 per cent - meaning the Fed has the unusual challenge of working to get inflation higher.\n\n\"If inflation is persistently running below our 2 per cent objective, that is a very good reason to hold the funds rate at its present range for longer,\" said Dr Yellen.\n\nThe freshly minted Fed chair was also asked about the crisis in Ukraine after reports that Russia had sold $US100 billion in US Treasuries in retaliation for US and EU sanctions.\n\nDr Yellen said she was unaware of any Russian selling, but confirmed the crisis is firmly on the Fed's radar as a potential risk.\n\n\"We're not seeing broader global financial repercussions but, if this were to escalate, that would certainly be something that would be on our radar screen, but we're not seeing that now and we're monitoring closely,\" she added.\n\nWall Street investors initially sold heavily on the rate rise speculation, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended just 0.7 per cent lower after investors absorbed the pre-conditions to lifting rates.\n\nThe US dollar surged on the renewed economic optimism and prospect of tighter monetary policy, and that saw the Australian dollar fall almost one US cent.\n\nThe Australian dollar had fallen further in local trade this morning, and was worth 90.16 US cents by 2:53pm (AEDT).\n\nTopics: money-and-monetary-policy, business-economics-and-finance, economic-trends, currency, stockmarket, united-states\n\nFirst posted","322":"Australian shares, dollar fall on Fed rates guidance\n\nPosted\n\nThe Australian share market and dollar have both fallen after the US Fed signalled it may raise rates sooner than most analysts had previously thought.\n\nThe Australian dollar lost around a cent overnight after the Federal Reserve's chair Dr Janet Yellen's press conference, and it has not recovered that ground in local trade today.\n\nAt 1:53pm (AEDT) the local currency was worth 90.18 US cents.\n\nLocal shares also suffered from the possibility that US interest rates might start rising early next year, with the Fed indicating that a 6.5 per cent unemployment rate no longer the necessary precondition for rate rises.\n\nThe ASX 200 index had fallen 0.9 per cent to 5,309, while the broader All Ordinaries was down 46 points to 5,327.\n\nThose falls are slightly worse than last night's slide on US markets, where the broad S&P 500 index retreated 0.6 per cent.\n\nAustralia's market has been dragged down by the preponderance of resources stocks, which have been sold off on fears that credit tightening in the developed world will cut commodity buying in the developing world.\n\nBHP Billiton was off 1.4 per cent to $35.35, Rio Tinto down 1 per cent and Fortescue off 7 cents to $4.92.\n\nGold miners were hit particularly hard, as the traders feel the wind back of easy money by the Fed makes spiralling inflation even less likely - Newcrest was off 6.7 per cent to $10.75.\n\nHowever, most stocks were lower outside of resources - Westpac and ANZ's 0.9 per cent falls were leading declines for the big four.\n\nRetailers were also dumped, following a disappointing first-half profit result from Myer, which had slumped 5.5 per cent.\n\nRival David Jones also fell 2.7 per cent to $3.23, as traders started to see Myer's merger proposal as less likely of getting up given its own struggles.\n\nHowever, the retail weakness extended even to the supermarket giants Woolworths and Wesfarmers, which were both down 1.1 per cent.\n\nTopics: money-and-monetary-policy, business-economics-and-finance, markets, currency, stockmarket, australia, united-states","323":"Sorry for inconvenience!\n\nYou have been redirected to this page due to the following reasons:--\n\nYour session has expired.\n\nYou have closed the browser, without logging out.\n\nIf the problem persists, kindly remove all the temporary files and cookies from your browser.\n\nFor IE - 1.

The Fed\u2019s first policymaking meeting under new Chair Janet Yellen ended Wednesday.\n\nThe projections also showed that Fed officials now think its short-term benchmark interest rate will rise slightly faster in 2015 than they thought three months ago. Most Fed policymakers say the rate will be 1 percent or higher by the end of 2015. In December, a majority thought it would be less than 1 percent by then.\n\nThe Fed expects unemployment to fall further this year than it thought in December. It forecasts that the unemployment rate will drop to 6.1 percent to 6.3 percent by the end of this year, down from its December projection of 6.3 percent to 6.6 percent.\n\nFed officials expect the same pattern next year: They are now forecasting growth of 3 percent to 3.2 percent, down from 3 percent to 3.4 percent.\n\nBut despite the slower growth, the Fed thinks unemployment will fall further, to 5.6 percent to 5.9 percent.

One member supports increasing it this year. Two support delaying an increase until 2016.

Reuters\n\nThe US Federal Reserve on Wednesday said it could keep interest rates unusually low even after the US job market returns to full strength and inflation rises to the central bank's target.\n\nIn announcing its view on future rates after a two-day policy meeting, it also dropped a set of guideposts it was using to help the public anticipate when it would finally start bumping overnight borrowing costs up from zero.\n\nIt said, however, that dropping a promise to hold rates steady \"well past the time\" the US unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent did not indicate any change in its policy intentions. Rather than relying on unemployment and inflation thresholds to guide expectations, it said would lean on a wide range of economic indicators in making its decision.\n\nBut what stood out in the central bank's statement was its embrace of easy money policies even after the Fed achieves its goals of full employment and 2 percent inflation.\n\nAlso read: The Indian Express Most Powerful Indians list\n\n\"Economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run,\" the Fed's policy panel said after its first meeting chaired by Janet Yellen.\n\nYellen, who took the helm of the central bank on Feb. 1, is set to hold a news conference at 2:30 p.m. (1830 GMT).\n\nU.S. stock prices fell after the statement was released, while yields on U.S. government debt rose.\n\nThe central bank also proceeded with its well-telegraphed reductions to its massive bond-buying stimulus, announcing it would cut its monthly purchases of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to $55 billion from $65 billion.\n\nMinneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota dissented, saying that dropping the threshold could hurt the credibility of the Fed's commitment to return inflation to 2 percent.\n\nMEASURE WIND DOWN\n\nThe decision to continue to scale back its stimulus keeps the Fed on track for the measured wind down laid out by Yellen's predecessor, Ben Bernanke. The Fed repeated that it plans to continue trimming the asset purchases in \"measured steps\" as long as labor conditions continue to improve and inflation shows signs of rising back toward the Fed's 2-percent goal.\n\nThe Fed's assessment of the U.S. economy chalked up recent weakness to adverse weather.\n\nThe Fed had said since December 2012 that it would not consider raising short-term rates until the jobless rate dropped to at least 6.5 percent, as long as inflation looked set to remain contained.\n\nBut the unemployment rate has fallen faster than anticipated, in part because of discouraged job hunters giving up the search, and officials think the economy is still far from ready for higher borrowing costs.\n\nOf the Fed's 16 policymakers, only one believes it will be appropriate to raise rates this year; 13 expect a first rate hike next year, and 2 others see the first rate hike coming in 2016, according to fresh forecasts published on Wednesday. But once rate hikes start, Fed officials see slightly sharper increases than they did in December, with rates ending 2015 at 1 percent and ending 2016 at 2.25 percent, according to the median of forecasts.\n\nIn December, Fed officials expected short-term rates to be just 1.75 percent by the end of 2016.\n\nThe new forecasts also show Fed officials see unemployment dropping slightly faster, to between 5.6 percent and 5.9 percent by the end of 2015. In December their forecasts called for unemployment falling to between 5.8 percent and 6.1 percent by the fourth quarter of 2015.\n\nKEEPING MARKETS IN LINE\n\nThe Fed has kept overnight rates near zero since December 2008 and has bought more than $3 trillion in long-term debt to keep borrowing costs down and spur investment and hiring.\n\nIt began to scale back its stimulus in December, announcing it would trim its monthly bond purchases by $10 billion, after it saw the economy pick up speed in the fall. In January, the Fed said it would cut the purchases by a further $10 billion.\n\nAt the same time, it has sought to tamp down any market expectations that rate rises will soon follow with its so-called forward guidance. But as the actual jobless rate neared the threshold, officials began to seek a more durable way to telegraph their view on when they will tighten monetary policy.\n\nThey want to keep market expectations aligned with their own forecasts. If traders start to price in earlier rate hikes, the result would be tighter financial conditions that could deter the very investment and hiring that the Fed wants to promote.\n\nMany Fed officials, including Yellen, have said recent weakness in economic data, from jobs and retail sales to industrial production and home building, appears largely due to the unusually harsh winter and should soon dissipate.\n\nUS Fed revamps rates guidance, trims bond buys further\n\nThe Federal Reserve on Wednesday dropped the U.S. unemployment rate as its definitive yardstick for gauging the economy's strength, and made clear it would rely on a wide range of measures in deciding when to raise interest rates.\n\nKEY POINTS:\n\n* Fed dropping its promise to hold rates steady \"well past the time\" the U.S. unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent doesn't indicate any change in the Fed's policy intentions.\n\n* Fed cuts monthly purchases of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to $55 billion from $65 billion.\n\n* Fed's assessment of the U.S. economy chalked up recent weakness to adverse weather.\n\nCOMMENTS: MARGARET KERINS, HEAD OF FIXED INCOME STRATEGY, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS, CHICAGO:\n\n\"Her speech was extremely dovish, but we believed going in to the Fed meeting today the market was priced to the perfect dove. There was a slight change in the summary of economic projections, the jobs were slightly more hawkish and the rapid improvement in the labor market was reflected in those projections by the Fed themselves, even though they're adding in quite a grouping of labor market indicators that they're watching.\n\n\"They're going to have to focus on that lack of growth potential going forward, and introducing that today. But clearly the market is reading it as hawkish. We don't think that the Fed given where we are in the economic cycle and in terms of the recovery, and our expectation that the economy will take off following this somewhat weather-related downturn that it's very, very hard to be credible about keeping rates really, really low.\"\n\nBRIAN JACOBSEN, CHIEF PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO FUNDS MANAGEMENT, MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN:\n\n\"I think the (stock) market initially reacted negatively to the Fed's statement because the forward guidance is mildly hawkish. Yellen is no dove. She's a pragmatist. The new forward guidance axes the 6.5 percent unemployment rate and replaces it with inflation expectations. The interesting twist here is that the Fed is fine with a zero federal funds rate provided the Fed projects inflation to still be below its target of 2 percent. It used to be that the Fed would tolerate projected inflation running a half percent hotter than that. Also, it's not just about the Fed's projections, but the public's expectations of inflation. The Fed wants to keep inflation expectations anchored and those expectations can be fickle.\"\n\nSCOTT CLEMONS, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, BROWN BROTHERS HARRIMAN PRIVATE BANKING, NEW YORK:\n\n\"It strikes me as a pretty dovish statement, but what surprised me is the word choice. Right now the unemployment rate remains elevated. I think that the Fed is far more focused on that than they are on their other mandate, inflation.\"\n\n\"The bigger picture here, to me this sends a very strong signal that the Yellen Fed is a continuation of the Bernanke Fed in one very important aspect. Whereas the Fed is often thought of as having two policy tools, balance sheet operations and interest rates, under Bernanke and Yellen they have made communication a very potent third tool as well. They're going to communicate, communicate, communicate so that when the fed funds rate begins to move higher, hopefully the collective economy shrugs its shoulders and says, 'Yeah, we knew that was coming.'\"\n\nJIM KOCHAN, CHIEF FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO FUNDS MANAGEMENT, MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN:\n\n\"The committee has updated its forward guidance, I wish they would tell us what that updated forward guidance is. We can assume their forward guidance is that they will be looking at broader measures of labor market activity to see when it's appropriate to raise interest rates, and 6.5 percent doesn't have much meaning anymore. If there are going to be any surprises it's going to be with the press conference. I think it was very much as expected.\"\n\nDAVID MOLAR, PARTNER AND MANAGING DIRECTOR AT HIGHTOWER, SAN DIEGO:\n\n\"The Fed moved the goal post again. It goes from a 6.5 percent unemployment threshold to a qualitative approach which is nebulous for the market. No one knows what will trigger further tapering, a pause in tapering or an increase in asset purchase. It's a major change in policy. This Fed seems to be making it up as it goes along. The markets are spiking on this even though analysts have been expecting this along. Gold has sold off and you are seeing pressure on bonds and rate-sensitive sectors.\"\n\nMARK GRANT, MANAGING DIRECTOR, SOUTHWEST SECURITIES, FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA: \"What seems to be troubling the market is that even though it reiterated that it wouldn't be raising rates this year, people were put on notice that a hike is coming. We'll likely see some rise in short rates as a result of this, if not out across the whole curve.\" SHAUN OSBORNE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES, TORONTO: \"It's a little bit more hawkish than people expected. They seem to see interest rates rising sooner rather than later. People had been expecting something slightly more dovish given the effects on economic activity from the harsh winter. This is helping the dollar.\" FRED DICKSON, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, D.A. DAVIDSON & CO, LAKE OSWEGO, OREGON: \"I think everybody expected a $10 billion cut in the rate of QE3 purchases to $55 billion, so there's no surprise there. \"There was a high degree of speculation in terms of changing the Fed language, so there was some clarity on that point. \"Probably the biggest takeaway was the Fed saying they would possibly consider maintaining monetary policy or interest rates lower than what they would normally be even when the Fed guideline targets of unemployment and inflation were hit. So the question becomes whether that would in fact create some inflation pressure.\" THOMAS DI GALOMA, CO-HEAD FIXED INCOME RATES, ED&F MAN CAPITAL, NEW YORK \"This statement from the Fed is as hawkish as it gets -- the only thing they did not do is (raise) rates today. The Fed is at neutral now and expect rate hikes to begin sometime in early 2015.\"\n\nWAYNE KAUFMAN, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, ROCKWELL SECURITIES, NEW YORK \"So far this is just what the market wanted-the Fed staying accommodative. It doesn't look like too much has changed, although dropping the 6.5 percent unemployment rate might be a key issue. Yields are jumping up right now, which might be a sign that people think Yellen will tighten sooner rather than later, or that inflation could come into the market if the Fed keeps rates low well past 6.5 percent.\"\n\nBRUCE McCAIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, KEY PRIVATE BANK, CLEVELAND, OHIO \"At this point, there are relatively few surprises. I think in some sense, as the Fed tapers it becomes less important for the market. What becomes more important from here is whether the economy can recover its momentum once the weather issue thaws. One of the headlines I saw was that a majority of members do expect a rate hike. I think that's a little disappointing for investors. In addition, if we replace the 6.5 percent rate with a variety of indicators, that makes Fed actions less predictable, which adds to the market uncertainty.\" PAUL MANGUS, HEAD OF EQUITY RESEARCH AND STRATEGY, WELLS FARGO PRIVATE BANK, CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA \"The one difference I could see early on was a little bit more information on when and by how much the Fed may increase rates in 2015, which is a long way off yet. Other than that, we expected to hear more about a wider range of economic indicators beyond the unemployment rate and that was in the release, so that was not a surprise. The economic information that was supplied was also pretty much as expected, mentions of weaker labor markets earlier in the year due to weather conditions but showing signs of improving. Other areas of the economy are continuing to show signs of gradual improvement, but the Fed was looking for a much stronger economic background before it would start any type of tightening efforts, so it would continue to support liquidity in the marketplace.\"\n\nAlso Check:\n\nLive: BSE Sensex\n\nCheck prices: All Models\n\nBuying used Car","327":"2014\/03\/20 15:51\n\nSEOUL, March 20 (Yonhap) -- South Korean stocks fell sharply Thursday following U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's comments on future interest rate hikes that pushed foreign investors and institutions to offload shares.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed 1.4 percent to a one-month trough.\n\nThe Nikkei took a further blow when data showed foreign investors sold a record 1.09 trillion yen ($10.7 billion) of Japanese stocks last week.\n\nYellen's words led the futures market for the US Fed funds rate to shift to pricing in around a 50-50 chance of the first hike in May to June next year. The timing had been July to August beforehand.\n\nYet many were not convinced the timetable had moved much at all. A Reuters poll of 17 primary dealers found 10 still expected the first hike to come in the second half of 2015, and four were still tipping 2016.\n\nThe whiplash was felt most in the short end of the Treasury market which is more sensitive to the course of the Fed funds rate. Yields on two-year notes shot up 8 basis points to 43 basis points, the sharpest single-day rise since mid 2011.\n\nYields on 10-year notes were at 2.75 percent, having risen 9 basis points on Wednesday. Since they act as the benchmark for bond yields across the globe, the shift will ripple through to higher borrowing costs for many countries.\n\nThe rise in US yields in turn helped lift the dollar and sent the euro reeling back a full cent to $1.3826. Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar was holding at 79.981 after adding 0.8 percent on Wednesday.\n\nThe US currency was also up at 102.31 yen, having jumped a full yen overnight and away from important chart support in the 101.20\/30 zone.\n\nThe dollar's gains were gold's undoing, sending the metal down to $1,333.25 an ounce. Its 1.8 percent drop on Wednesday was the biggest one-day fall since January.\n\nNeither has the prospect of rising rates in the United States been good for some emerging markets as it threatens to draw capital away, pressuring equities and currencies.\n\nIt also comes as China seems to be weakening its yuan as a way to support a slowing economy, which puts pressure on other nations in the region to lower their currencies to stay competitive on exports.\n\nThe yuan skidded to its lowest in a year on Thursday at 6.2280 per dollar, a long way from where it started the year at 6.0515 and a huge move for the normally tightly-controlled currency.\n\nLast weekend the People's Bank of China (PBOC) doubled the daily trading band allowed for the yuan to 2 percent from the mid-point that it sets each day.\n\nIn oil markets, Brent futures edged up 28 cents to $106.13 per barrel on Thursday, while US crude oil added 36 cents to $100.73. \u2013 Reuters\n\nStory first published: 20th March 2014","335":"Bollywood\n\nSuperstars Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan, who have known each other for over two decades, have posed together for the first time for a selfie.","336":"Federal Reserve reaffirms commitment to cheap money for Wall Street\n\nBy Andre Damon\n\n20 March 2014\n\nFederal Reserve chair Janet Yellen reassured Wall Street Wednesday that the US central bank would continue to keep interest rates near zero even if the unemployment rate continued to fall, in her first press conference since taking office in February. Her remarks followed a two-day meeting by the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) and the release of its official monetary policy statement.\n\nThe Federal Reserve had insisted since December 2012 that it would consider raising the federal funds rate once the unemployment rate fell to 6.5 percent, but in its latest policy statement, the central bank dropped its references to any particular level of unemployment as a criterion for raising interest rates. \u201cThe purpose of this change is simply to provide more information than we have in the past, even though it is qualitative information, as the unemployment rate declines below 6.5 percent,\u201d Yellen said.\n\nThe official jobless rate, now at 6.7 percent, has fallen faster than Federal Reserve officials had anticipated, not because jobs are more plentiful, but because millions of workers have given up looking for work amid dismal labor market conditions.\n\nThe number of people not in the labor force has increased by two million in the past year alone, and, according to the Economic Policy Institute, 5.66 million \u201cmissing workers\u201d have dropped out of the labor force over the past five years. If these missing workers were counted as unemployed, the unemployment rate would be around 10 percent.\n\nThe Fed downgraded its assessment of economic conditions compared to its December forecast, with its official statement noting that, \u201cgrowth in economic activity slowed during the winter months.\u201d The Fed predicts that the economy will grow at a rate of 3 percent or less this year, compared to its December estimate of up to 3.2 percent. As expected, the Fed announced that it would reduce the size of its \u201cquantitative easing\u201d asset purchases by another $10 billion, bringing the rate of its purchases of Treasury notes and mortgage-backed securities to $55 billion in April.\n\nYellen\u2019s comments constituted a reaffirmation that the Federal Reserve continues to be committed to its zero-interest rate policy \u201cfor a considerable time.\u201d But despite these assurances, financial markets were not happy with the press conference. All three US stock indexes plunged while Yellen was speaking, with the S&P 500 down by 11 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average down by 114 points, and the NASDAQ down by 25 points.\n\nThe market selloff was attributed to an official survey, issued together with the FOMC report, indicating that Fed officials envision beginning to raise interest rates earlier than had previously expected. The survey predicted that the Federal Funds rate would be 1 percent by the end of 2015, up from earlier projections of 0.75 percent, implying that the Federal Reserve may begin tightening interest rates in the summer.\n\nThe panicked market response, even amid assurances that the Federal Reserve would not begin raising interest rates despite the fall in the unemployment rate, is an indicator of the extent to which the entire functioning of the US economy is dependent on continual cash infusions from the central bank.\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve remains committed to its zero-interest rate policies at least for the next year, there are increasing concerns that the Fed\u2019s enormous cash infusions are fueling a financial market bubble. Over the past year, for example, the NASDAQ has risen by one third, even as the real economy remains depressed.\n\nYellen has sought to reassure the public\u2014like all of her predecessors\u2014that there is little reason to suspect another financial meltdown, telling Congress earlier this month that, \u201cI\u2019d say my general assessment at this point is I can\u2019t see threats to financial stability that have built to the point of flashing orange or red.\u201d\n\nThe vast growth in the stock market has significantly increased the wealth of the super-rich. In 2013, Warren Buffett, the head of Berkshire Hathaway, had his net worth increase by $12.7 billion; that of Jeffrey Bezos grew by $12 billion, while Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook saw his wealth nearly double, from $11.3 billion to $23 billion.\n\nBut behind this enormous expansion in paper wealth lies the fact that the US economy continues to be significantly depressed. December and January was the worst two-month period for jobs growth since 2010, and the US economy added only 175,000 jobs in February, barely enough to keep up with population growth. Earlier this month the Bureau of Economic Analysis downgraded its estimate for real US economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 to 2.4 percent, down from its first estimate of 3.2 percent released at the end of January.\n\nThere are still 651,000 fewer jobs than before the recession, even though the working-age population has grown by about 8 million during that time. The labor force participation rate is down by 0.5 percent from a year ago and has fallen by about 3.5 percentage points since 2007.\n\nYellen emphasized that even after the Federal Reserve begins to raise the federal funds rate from the present near-zero level, interest rates may not return to the previous historical norm. The FOMC statement noted, \u201cthe Committee anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.\u201d\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.","337":"Sorry, the page you're looking for cannot be found.\n\nThe page may have moved, you may have mistyped the address, or followed a bad link.\n\nVisit our homepage, or search for whatever you were looking for\u2026","338":"Not found!\n\nWe've got a brand new website and I'm afraid the link you followed no longer exists.\n\nPlease click here to return to our homepage: http:\/\/www.tribtown.com","339":"Boosted by higher prices and soaring deliveries, home builder Lennar (LEN) beat the Street on Thursday with a 36% jump in fiscal first-quarter profits.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nShares of Miami-based Lennar advanced over 1% on the stronger-than-expected results, which come as Wall Street begins to worry about how higher interest rates will impact real estate companies.\n\nThe No. 2 U.S. home builder said it earned $78.1 million, or 35 cents per share, last quarter, compared with a profit of $57.5 million, or 26 cents a share, a year earlier.

I am Janelle Beland , Undersecretary of the California Natural Resources Agency . The state of California appreciates the invitation to appear before your field hearing today to offer testimony on our response to the ongoing drought crisis.\n\nCalifornia is experiencing a severe drought. On the heels of two previous dry years, all of the state's major reservoirs remain well below average storage for the date. Statewide, the water content of the Sierra snowpack also is well below average for the date. Recent storms have not ended the drought, and the window for California to gain significant precipitation is closing. The latest National Weather Service data continue to show nearly the entire state in severe drought and nearly two-thirds in extreme drought.\n\nAlthough long-range forecasts suggest a shift to weak El Nino conditions in the coming months, this does not mean that the drought in California will be over next winter. State and federal water project operators and environmental and water quality regulators are working together in real time to exercise as much flexibility as possible under regulatory standards to allow for the capture and storage of water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta). Every effort has been made to maximize the amount of water the projects could export during the storms in February and March, with the realization that this may be the last opportunity to capture and store unregulated flow during this winter season.\n\nThese efforts are being closely coordinated with state and federal fishery agencies and the State Water Resources Control Board ( State Board ), which is exercising flexibility allowed under the law. This real-time water management will continue to adjust operations in response to changing conditions.\n\nIn the coming weeks, in order to help preserve water supplies in upstream reservoirs and limit salinity encroachment in channels of the Delta, the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) is developing plans to install temporary emergency rock barriers across three Delta channels. DWR is working with federal and state wildlife agencies and the US Army Corps of Engineers to gain permits for installation of these emergency barriers, which would be removed in the fall. Similar emergency barriers were last installed in the drought year of 1977, and the barriers worked as intended to help control salinity.\n\nOverview of Statewide Conditions\n\nAs previously mentioned, despite several consecutive days of rain across California this month, we are significantly behind average precipitation conditions for this time of year.\n\nThe statewide snowpack shows 29 percent of average snow water content for the date, slightly less than last week's measurement. The snowpack water content is currently at 19 percent in the northern Sierra, 35 percent in the central Sierra, and 33 percent in the southern Sierra.\n\nTypically, the Sierra Nevada snowpack melts in the spring and summer. It collects in reservoirs to provide about one-third of the water Californians use each year.\n\nMajor reservoir storage rose slightly over the last couple of weeks but is still significantly below average. Shasta stands at 58 percent of typical storage for this time of year. Oroville storage is 62 percent of average and Folsom Lake is at 67 percent of average storage for this time of year.\n\nFederal, state, and local water projects that rely on snowpack in the Cascades and the Sierra -- the source of most of California's developed water supply -- will be operating under unprecedented dry conditions this summer, and will be challenged to manage their systems to conserve vital reservoir storage.\n\nThe very low reservoir and snowpack levels dictate that we must be prudent with our minimal water supplies, and that requires additional flexibility to operate the state and federal water projects. In this extraordinarily dry year, all water users, including agricultural, municipal, and fish and wildlife uses, will be impacted.\n\nTo maximize flexibility, the project operators, DWR and the US Bureau of Reclamation (Bureau) have coordinated closely to exercise maximum flexibility and allow the water projects to conserve and store water as they continue to assess the water needs for later in the year and into 2015. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (DFW) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) have coordinated closely with these agencies, and have worked to ensure that water management decisions do minimal harm to endangered and protected species.\n\nOne primary concern has been to ensure that enough water can be directed to communities for human health and safety purposes, which includes basic needs such as drinking water and water for sanitation and firefighting. While some communities have adequate water supplies saved locally for such purposes, other communities need continued exports from the delta for these essential purposes. It should be noted that the agencies' intent has been to ensure enough water in communities for these essential purposes, but not to deliver exports for all normal usage (such as exterior landscape irrigation).\n\nAnother primary concern is being able to prevent saltwater intrusion into the interior Delta where a large portion of the state's freshwater supplies are conveyed for human and agricultural use. A certain amount of flow must continue throughout dry months to push back saltwater from the interior Delta. If there is not enough water to maintain this flow throughout the year, we will lose control over salinity in the Delta and fresh water sources travelling through the interior Delta will become contaminated. This severely compromises the water projects' ability to deliver water for basic public health and safety or irrigation uses. This is a very real concern this year.\n\nJanuary is typically the wettest month in California , but January 2014 proved an extraordinary anomaly. Scant rain or snow fell across the state for the entire month. It was the driest month on record for most places in the state, and it followed two previous dry years.\n\nOn January 29, 2014 , DWR and the Bureau asked the State Board to adjust water rights permit and license terms that normally control State Water Project and federal Central Valley Project operations. DWR and the Bureau sought this \"temporary urgency change\" in order to preserve dwindling supplies in upstream reservoirs for farms, fisheries, and cities and towns as the drought continues. The relief sought in the petition would also provide additional time to assess how much water the projects would need for salinity control and essential public health and safety needs throughout the year as mentioned above.\n\nThis temporary urgency change order (order) did the following:\n\n. Allowed a reduced Delta outflow so that the state and federal water projects could conserve their dwindling supplies in reservoirs for later in the year;\n\n. Allowed for the operation of the Delta Cross Channel gates in real time so less flow would be needed to repel salinity;\n\n. Established a Real Time Drought Operations Management Team.\n\nDWR and the Bureau are now in the process of quantifying those public health and safety needs and defining precisely how any water set aside for public health and safety purposes may be used. The definition will not include deliveries to farms for irrigation or homeowners for lawn-watering.\n\nOn January 31 , the State Board's Executive Director also advised that \"junior priority\" water-right holders may be ordered to curtail their diversions from the Sacramento and San Joaquin river systems. These curtailments would be structured to occur in a manner that respects water rights, with senior water right holders being the last to have their water restricted, as required under state law. Curtailments will be based on river gauges on each watercourse, and have not yet occurred.\n\nAlso, on January 31 , DWR announced that its customers - 29 public water agencies serving cities and farms - should expect no deliveries in 2014 if significant precipitation did not occur in the next few months. These customers could expect delivery only of \"carryover\" supplies that they had not used in 2013. The zero allocation is the first-ever for all customers in the State Water Project's 54-year history.\n\nThe announcement does not mean that anyone's tap will run dry, but it will trigger difficult decisions for many farmers, and it underscores the need for aggressive conservation by all Californians.\n\nAlso on January 31 , DWR notified long-time water rights holders in the Sacramento Valley that their deliveries from the State Water Project may be cut 50 percent, the maximum cut permitted under contract, depending upon the results of future snow surveys. All of these settlement contractors are agricultural irrigation districts.\n\nOn February 7 , the order was amended to include the flexibility needed after recent storms, when natural flows are high enough, so that the limits on Delta exports would not be in effect and normal conditions would apply.\n\nTwo separate, moderate storm systems moved across California in February. Water project operators worked with the state and federal wildlife agencies to maximize regulatory flexibility so that as much storm runoff as possible could be captured and stored in San Luis Reservoir , south of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta , with minimal harm to Delta water quality and threatened and endangered Delta species. February 2014 proved wetter than January, but not enough to end the drought or avoid a high-stakes balancing act in water project operations.\n\nAround February 9 , Delta outflow started spiking after the first significant rain event to hit this winter. From February 10 to February 11 , the state and federal water projects increased their pumping from the Delta to about 6,000 cfs, maintaining that level until February 18 .\n\nDuring the month of February, the state and federal projects received additional flexibility in the amount they could export from the Delta, via the coordination established under the Real-Time Drought Operations Management Team process for operating Delta facilities established by the January order. Additionally, federal and state fish and wildlife agencies have made similar adjustments to export limitations based on their authorities and permits.\n\nAs a result, additional water was pumped from the Delta in February and March due to regulatory flexibility granted the projects by federal and state fishery agencies. The rest of the water was pumped from the Delta under compliance with existing regulations that did not require use of the \"temporary urgency change\" or the easing of any standards designed to protect water quality and fish species.\n\nHere is a more detailed analysis of Delta water project operations from February to today:\n\nFrom Feb. 1 through Feb. 9 , record-dry conditions in Northern California kept Delta outflow (the volume of water flowing out of the Delta into San Francisco Bay ) at roughly 7,000 cubic feet per second (cfs). The combined export of the State Water Project and Central Valley Project (the amount of water diverted from the Delta into storage at San Luis Reservoir ) was held at slightly under 1,000 cfs due to degraded water quality conditions in the Delta.\n\nAround Feb. 9 , Delta outflow started spiking after the first significant rain event to hit this winter. In addition, the Delta Cross Channel Gates were opened as part of the \"temporary urgency change\" order granted by the State Board . That order allowed for modified implementation of the requirements in D-1641, a water rights decision of the State Board that sets salinity and other water quality objectives for the Delta and Bay.\n\nWith Delta water quality improving, from Feb. 10 to Feb. 11 , the combined water project exports ramped up to about 6,000 cfs and stayed there until Feb. 18 .\n\nBy Feb. 18 , Delta outflow had dropped to 8,000 cfs as the storm runoff dwindled.\n\nExports ramped down and reached the minimum health and safety level of 1,500 cfs by Feb. 23 . Exports stayed at that minimum health and safety level until March 2 . By March 2 , with the return of significant rain, Delta outflow jumped to 26,000 cfs. Exports increased gradually from March 2 through March 4 to reach 6,000 cfs, then climbed over the next several days to reach 6,800 cfs.\n\nBeginning on March 11 , Delta outflow dropped to 11,000 cfs, then rose again to just under 17,000 cfs. Delta outflows are now headed back down to levels below 10,000 cfs by the middle of next week.\n\nCombined water project exports have remained at just under 7,000 cfs and were scheduled to remain at that level through last weekend. The upper levels of exports were constrained by a multitude of existing regulations established to protect Delta fisheries including requirements of D-1641 and federal rules to protect Delta smelt and chinook salmon, which are listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the California Endangered Species Act (CESA).\n\nOperators of the State Water Project and Central Valley Project , together with representatives of the federal and state fishery agencies and the State Board , are working collaboratively to find flexibility in the implementation of these regulations. They seek to maximize exports to the extent possible under the law, with the realization that the last set of storms may be the last opportunity to capture and store unregulated flow during this winter season.\n\nIn a normal year, the state and federal water projects would be required to keep Delta outflow at 11,000 cfs during March, primarily to protect habitat for fish and wildlife. In particular, these flow requirements are elevated during this time of year because of the migratory life cycle of salmon. Increased flows help them move through the Delta ecosystem. This means that under a normal year's rules, 11,000 cfs is required to flow out of the Delta and through the San Francisco Bay . However, amid drought conditions and the need to conserve and export precious water, flexibility for this requirement was explored and the state and federal fisheries agencies have advised that reducing the flow below 11,000 cfs will not unreasonably affect fish and wildlife.\n\nThe upper levels of exports are constrained by regulations to protect Delta fisheries and federal rules to protect Delta smelt and Chinook salmon, which are listed under the ESA and CESA. Operators of the federal and state projects are working collaboratively with the federal and state fish agencies and the State Board to maximize flexibility in the implementation of these regulations.\n\nDuring the coming weeks and months, the project operators will work in close coordination with the state and federal fish agencies to ensure that the system stays within current requirements for fish. And they will closely monitor fish species affected by project operations to assess whether further protections are warranted.\n\nDWR and the Bureau are gathering data and looking at how much water will be needed through the dry months and possibly into next year to maintain salinity control in the Delta, meet minimal public health and safety needs, and abide legal requirements to protect threatened and endangered fish. This review should clarify the water needed for these purposes for the rest of the year and possibly into next year if we experience a fourth dry year.\n\nAt that time, the state and federal water projects will be able to update their allocation projections to their water contractors, based on the prudent assessment of water in the system for carryover storage needs for the coming dry months.\n\nRecent State Actions\n\nState and federal water management agencies continue to work together to allow exports of additional water from the Delta based on storms in the last six weeks. Recent precipitation has provided a window of opportunity to capture additional water for storage both north and south of the Delta, and both the state and federal water projects have increased pumping for a limited time to capture as much water as possible under current regulatory standards.\n\nLast week, DFW and the State Board announced that they will expedite approval of storage tanks built by rural residents for domestic water use. These storage tanks help protect drinking water supplies and increase fire safety by giving rural residents a water supply that they can manage on their own property.\n\nThis week the State Board approved reduced cost financing for recycled water projects to speed the construction of such projects. They are also working to expedite approval of such projects.\n\nDFW, USFWS, and NMFS last week released a contingency plan for the release of small fish raised in federal and state hatcheries. Due to the drought, new measures will be taken to release the hatchlings in portions of the Delta that allow for their migration to the ocean while enabling their eventual return to lay eggs and continue their life cycle.\n\nThe Governor's Office and state agencies have launched drought.ca.gov, which will provide a central location for drought information. Agencies will continue their own drought webpages, and drought.ca.gov will include a listing of these webpages.\n\nThe Governor's Office of Planning and Research has posted online its drought toolkit for local governments, which outline actions that communities can take to respond to the drought.\n\nThis week on March 21 , the Governor's tribal advisor will hold a statewide consultation call with tribal leaders to continue discussions on drought response with Interagency Drought Task Force officials.\n\nThe Department of General Services held a water conservation training last week for facility managers from state and local governments, as well as school districts across the state, to provide information and support to their water use reduction efforts. Over 300 managers from across the state participated.\n\nThe Governor's Office of Emergency Services continues to gather drought-related costs from state agencies and local governments, which is reported weekly to the Drought Task Force . The task force continues to meet daily to take actions that conserve water and coordinate state response to the drought.\n\nOn March 3 , Governor Brown signed a $687.4 million drought relief plan (SB 103 and SB 104). Highlights of the package include:\n\n. Accelerated grant expenditures of $549 million under Proposition 1E and Proposition 84 in the form of infrastructure grants for local and regional projects that are already planned or partially completed to increase local reliability, including recapturing of storm water, expanding the use and distribution of recycled water, enhancing the management and recharging of groundwater storage and strengthening water conservation.\n\n. $30 million from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to DWR for direct expenditures and grants to state and local agencies to improve water use efficiency, save energy, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from state and local water transportation and management systems.\n\n. $14 million for groundwater management across the state, including assistance to disadvantaged communities with groundwater contamination exacerbated by drought.\n\n. $15 million from the state general fund to address emergency water shortages due to drought.\n\n. $13 million from the general fund to augment the state and local conservation corps to expand water use efficiency and conservation activities and to reduce fuel loads to prevent catastrophic wildfires.\n\n. $25.3 million from the general fund to be deployed to maximize the potential federal drought assistance for providing food to those impacted by the drought.\n\n. $21 million from the general fund for housing-related assistance for those impacted by the drought.\n\n. $1 million to continue the Save Our Water public education campaign.\n\nOn February 21 , DWR sent letters to counties and well-drilling contractors asking for timely submission of well completion forms. This information will help DWR track increased use of groundwater and new well installation activities.\n\nDWR and the Bureau continue to monitor water quality in the western, central, and southern Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta . The cross-channel gates along the Sacramento River near Walnut Grove were closed due to fishery concerns.\n\nOn February 12 , DWR and the Bureau filed a petition with the State Board seeking authority to exchange water within the areas served by the federal Central Valley Project and the State Water Project and vice versa.\n\nOn February 10 , DWR announced the award of $153 million to help fund 138 separate water projects around the state, 35 of which will help communities cope with drought in the long-term.\n\nDWR is working with the Bureau and the State Board to ensure an efficient process to transfer water between voluntary buyers and sellers. However, given the uncertainty of water supplies, few proposals for voluntary sales may be submitted.\n\nOn January 17 , Governor Brown proclaimed a state of emergency and directed state officials to take all necessary actions to prepare for drought conditions. The governor asked all Californians to reduce water consumption by 20 percent and referred residents and water agencies to the Save Our Water campaign for practical advice on how to do so. The governor also directed state agencies to use less water and to hire more firefighters.\n\nKey measures in the proclamation included:\n\n1. directing local water suppliers to immediately implement local water shortage contingency plans;\n\n2. ordering the State Water Resources Control Board to consider petitions for consolidation of places of use for the State Water Project and Central Valley Project , which could streamline water transfers and exchanges between water users;\n\n3. directing DWR and the state board to accelerate funding for projects that could break ground this year and enhance water supplies;\n\n4. ordering the state water board to put water rights holders across the state on notice that they may be directed to cease or reduce water diversions based on water shortages;\n\n5. asking the water board to consider modifying water quality control plan rules that require the release of water from reservoirs so that water may be conserved in reservoirs to protect cold water supplies for salmon and maintain water supplies;\n\n6. and directing the state Department of Public Health to provide technical and financial assistance to communities at risk of running out of drinking water.\n\nThe governor's proclamation is the fourth action taken by a governor since 1987 to deal with drought on a statewide basis.\n\nThe governor, through the emergency proclamation, directed his interagency drought task force to devise a plan to provide emergency food supplies, financial assistance, and unemployment services to communities hard-hit by drought-induced job losses.\n\nAgriculture-Specific Actions\n\nState officials are working closely with federal agencies to provide assistance to farmers, ranchers and farmworkers in the most impacted communities. The California Department of Food and Agriculture has launched a one-stop website that provides updates on the drought and connects farmers to helpful state and federal programs they can access during the drought. Farmers, ranchers and farmworkers can learn more at: cdfa.ca.gov\/drought\/\n\n. The site features links to crop insurance programs, crop disaster assistance, emergency farm loans and federal water conservation program assistance.\n\n. Governor Brown's partnership with the Obama Administration on behalf of California has already led to millions of dollars in potential assistance for farmers and ranchers. Those opportunities are chronicled on the web page.\n\nThe White House on Friday, February 14, 2014 , announced emergency funding from several federal programs to support drought response. This announcement was coordinated with President Obama 's visit to Fresno County .\n\nEmergency assistance includes:\n\n. $100 million in expedited livestock disaster assistance to California farmers and ranchers. This funding, contained in the 2014 Farm Bill, will be made available through the USDA in 60 days. Funding assistance can cover financial losses by California producers in 2012, 2013 and 2014.\n\n. $60 million for California food banks to help families affected by the drought. Funding will be provided by the USDA's Emergency Food Assistance Program .\n\n. $5 million of funding for conservation projects at California farms and ranches, provided by USDA's Environmental Quality Incentives Program.\n\n. $5 million for emergency watershed improvements to enable activities such as stabilizing stream banks and replanting bare lands. Funds will come through the USDA's Emergency Watershed Protection Programs.\n\n. $3 million for emergency grants to rural communities facing drinking water shortages. Funds come through USDA's Emergency Community Water Assistance program.\n\n. Summer food programs: The USDA committed to expanding the number of Summer Food Service Program meal sites to 600 locations in drought stricken areas throughout the state.\n\nLong-Term Actions\n\nThere is broad agreement that the state's water management system is currently unable to satisfactorily meet both ecological and human needs, too exposed to wet and dry climate cycles and natural disasters, and inadequate to handle the additional pressures of future population growth and climate change. Solutions are complex and expensive, and they require the cooperation and sustained commitment of all Californians working together. To be sustainable, solutions must strike a balance between the need to provide for public health and safety (e.g., safe drinking water, clean rivers and beaches, flood protection), protect the environment, and support a stable California economy.\n\nAs we work on emergency actions to manage through this crisis, we are also taking proactive, long-term steps to prepare California for future droughts and flood. Our long term approach to preparing California's water future is captured in the California Water Action Plan which was released in January of this year. This plan will guide California's efforts to enhance water supply reliability, restore damaged and destroyed ecosystems, and improve the resilience of our infrastructure. We are working daily to balance needs and interests throughout the state on the overall long term sustainability of our water resources. This is not just about the current problem of this serious drought.\n\nThe California Water Action Plan has been developed to meet three broad objectives: more reliable water supplies, the restoration of important species and habitat, and a more resilient, sustainably managed water resources system that can better withstand inevitable and unforeseen pressures in the coming decades. Altogether, this plan centers on sustaining supplies of water for people, the environment, industry and agriculture.\n\nThis action plan lays out our challenges, our goals and decisive actions needed now to put California's water resources on a safer, more sustainable path. While this plan commits the state to moving forward, it also serves to recognize that state government cannot do this alone. Collaboration between federal, state, local and tribal governments, in coordination with our partners in a wide range of industry, government and nongovernmental organizations is not only important--it is essential.\n\nThe Water Action Plan, over the next five years, will guide state efforts to enhance water supply reliability, restore damaged and destroyed ecosystems, and improve the resilience of our infrastructure.\n\nWith this plan, we recognize that water recycling, expanded water storage and groundwater management must all be part of the solution. We must also make investments in safe drinking water, restore wetlands and watersheds and make further progress on the Bay Delta Conservation Plan. All of these things are critical to the long-term solution.\n\nTen key actions identified:\n\n. Make conservation a California way of life.\n\n. Increase regional self-reliance and integrated water management across all levels of government.\n\n. Achieve the co-equal goals for the Delta.\n\n. Protect and restore important ecosystems.\n\n. Manage and prepare for dry periods.\n\n. Expand water storage capacity and improve groundwater management.\n\n. Provide safe water for all communities.\n\n. Increase flood protection.\n\n. Increase operational and regulatory efficiency.\n\n. Identify sustainable and integrated financing opportunities.\n\nThere are many important components imbedded under each of these ten actions. For the committee's benefit, let me highlight just two of these that go to the heart of this hearing's topic of addressing long-term solutions.\n\nThe Delta is California's major collection point for water, serving two-thirds of our state's population and providing irrigation water for millions of acres of farmland. We know too well the challenges of moving water through the Delta's fragile levee system with declining fish populations and historic restrictions on water deliveries. But, the status quo in the Delta is unacceptable and it would be irresponsible to wait for further degradation or a natural disaster before taking action.\n\nWhile we are working to implement the Delta Plan, one component remains to be completed: The Bay-Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP). State and federal agencies will complete planning for this comprehensive conservation strategy aimed at protecting dozens of species of fish and wildlife in the Delta, while permitting the reliable operation of California's two biggest water delivery projects.\n\nThe BDCP will help secure California's water supply by building new water delivery infrastructure and operating the system to improve the ecological health of the Delta. It will also restore or protect approximately 145,000 acres of habitat to address the Delta's environmental challenges. The BDCP is made up of specific actions, called conservation measures, to improve the Delta ecosystem. It includes 22 conservation measures aimed at improving water operations, protecting water supplies and water quality, and restoring the Delta ecosystem within a stable regulatory framework. The project will be guided by 214 specific biological goals and objectives, improved science, and an adaptive management approach for operating the water conveyance facilities and implementing other conservation measures including habitat restoration and programs to address other stressors. As the Delta ecosystem improves in response to the implementation of the conservation measures, water operations will become more reliable, offering secure water supplies for 25 million Californians, an agricultural industry that feeds millions, and a thriving economy.\n\nState and federal agencies will complete the state and federal environmental review documents; seek approval of the BDCP by the state and federal fishery agencies; secure all permits required to implement the BDCP; finalize a financing plan; complete the design of BDCP facilities; and begin implementation of all conservation measures and mitigation measures, including construction of water conveyance improvements. Once the BDCP is permitted, it will become part of the Delta Plan.\n\nWe agree that we need to expand our state's storage capacity, whether surface or groundwater, whether big or small. We need more storage to deal with the effects of drought and climate change on water supplies for both human and ecosystem needs. Climate change will bring more frequent drought conditions and could reduce by half our largest natural storage system--the Sierra snowpack--as more precipitation falls as rain rather than snow, and as snow melts earlier and more rapidly. Moreover, we must better manage our groundwater basins to reverse alarming declines in groundwater levels. Continued declines in groundwater levels could lead to irreversible land subsidence, poor water quality, reduced surface flows, ecosystem impacts, and the permanent loss of capacity to store water as groundwater.\n\nAmong other actions to expand water storage, our plan supports funding partnerships for storage projects. The Brown administration will work with the Legislature to make funding available to share in the cost of storage projects if funding partners step forward. The state will facilitate among willing local partners and stakeholders the development of financeable, multi-benefit storage projects, including working with local partners to complete feasibility studies. For example, the Sites Project Joint Powers Agreement, formed by a group of local government entities in the Sacramento Valley , is a potential emerging partnership that can help federal and state government determine the viability of a proposed off stream storage project - Sites Reservoir .\n\nOver the next five years, this Water Action Plan will help us advance sustainable water management by providing a more reliable water supply for our farms and communities, restoring important wildlife habitat and species, and helping the state's water systems and environment become more resilient.\n\nBay Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP)\n\nThe Draft Bay Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP) and associated EIR\/EIS is now available for public review and comment. Lead state and federal agencies recently extended the public comment period for the EIR\/EIS by 60 days. The review period now totals 180 days stretching from Dec. 13, 2013 to June 13, 2014 . This extension will allow the public more time to review and comment on the public draft documents. The 180-day comment period is four times that of the required 45 days in order to ensure the public has plenty of time to review the draft documents. This extension is not anticipated to cause significant delays in the project, although it will likely extend the anticipated release date for the Final Draft BDCP and EIR\/EIS. The public review draft documents are available online and electronically at libraries throughout the state serving as document repositories. DVD copies are also available on request.\n\nAs of February 12 , DWR completed 12 public open house meetings throughout the state on the public review draft plan and associated EIR\/EIS. More than 800 participants attended statewide. The meetings in Sacramento , Clarksburg and Stockton had the highest attendance, with Sacramento topping the list at 165 participants. A broad range of engaged stakeholder groups attended every meeting, including environmental, industry, business, water, and labor groups. Feedback has been that participants appreciated the format, and the ability to have one-on-one conversations with technical staff involved in the development of the project.\n\nOur goal is to allow as many people as possible to provide comments, all of which will be carefully considered and will ultimately help shape the development of the final project.\n\nIf there's one thing these last two to three years demonstrate is that we need conveyance in place that can move water during wet years in a way that's safer for fish. Doing that allows us to lay-off in the dry years. We can't manage very easily through droughts without it. In the long-term, California must continue to focus on actions to modernize our water delivery system by completing the environmental planning process for the BDCP.\n\nWith the conveyance proposed in the Bay Delta Conservation Plan in place, the Central Valley this year would have an extra 800,000 acre-feet of water in the San Luis Reservoir . This effort to restore the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta ecosystem and greatly enhance the water system's reliability is the best investment we can make right now in our water future.\n\nIn closing, it is important to note that California water policy moves in fits and starts tied to floods and droughts. When the rain and snow falls steadily and predictably, Californians tend to assume it will always be so. It's human nature.\n\nWe intend to take advantage of the public's hyper-focus on water issues this year to advance improvements to our water system.\n\nEast Coast newspaper reporters lately have looked at our muddy reservoirs and declared that California has finally overreached and hit a wall.\n\nWe know better. We know it's because of our reservoirs -- as well as our investments in water conservation, recycling, drip irrigation, groundwater recharge, and a host of other smart water management techniques -- that we've been able to build a nearly $2 trillion economy in a state with hydrology that is as varied - both temporally and geographically - as California .\n\nWe are the most populous state, with the richest farm economy, and the most diverse natural heritage in the nation. Our water system gets us through all but the most extreme, outlier years like this one without much sacrifice. We will cope, invest, and thrive.\n\nOn behalf of my colleagues at the state level, and our partners at the federal level, I would like to thank you for holding this important hearing and providing this opportunity to provide testimony. Thank you for your attention to these issues.\n\nRead this original document at: http:\/\/naturalresources.house.gov\/UploadedFiles\/BelandTestimony3-19-14.pdf","353":"If water managers wielded a divining rod, the forked end would not point toward the heavens nor the Sierra Nevada. It would bend toward a major water source hundreds of feet beneath the Earth's crust.\n\nIndeed, with zero percent allocation from the State Water Project and a state mired in the third year of drought, even recent rainstorms can't bring the familiar sources -- aqueducts carrying water from Northern California -- back to normal.\n\nInstead, managers must find salvation in vast, underground lakes holding billions of gallons of fresh water stretching from the San Fernando to the San Gabriel Valley, from Southeast L.A. County to the West Basin and the Santa Ana River into the Inland Empire.\n\nOnce the man-made reservoirs run low -- say by this time next year -- water managers will depend on their last resort, the basins.\n\nIn short, water managers say they have enough supplies to get us through a third year of drought and a dusty summer without pressing the crisis button. But \"Drought 2015\" will become a game of aquifers and attitudes.\n\nFor example, jumping ahead a year, the city of Los Angeles may be in the worst shape.\n\nThirty years ago, Los Angeles received 70 percent of its water from the Los Angeles Aqueduct and 15 percent from both ground water aquifers and imported water purchased from Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. Today, the numbers have changed dramatically to 40 percent from the L.A. Aqueduct, 10 percent from ground water and 50 percent from MWD, said Marty Adams, head of water operations at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.\n\nRelying more and more on state water imported from Northern California is not a secure formula. This year, the agency celebrated the 100th anniversary of the L.A. Aqueduct. Hidden amid the fanfare was this statistic: the lowest amount of water came down the concrete channel in its history, Adams said.\n\nIn its heydey, the L.A. Aqueduct, which once turned Mono Lake into a salt flat, yielded 460,000 acre-feet of water. This year, it yielded 60,000 acre-feet, he said. An acre-foot of water is one acre of land covered in water 1 foot deep or about enough water for two families for a year.\n\nIn 2015, the LADWP will be forced to buy between 70 percent and 75 percent of its supplies from MWD, Adams said. The MWD reserves -- stored since 2009, the year the last drought ended -- are available at near 100 percent capacity at Pyramid Lake, Castaic Lake and Diamond Valley Lake in Hemet.\n\nThe only problem may be getting that water to the people in the San Fernando Valley, Adams said. \"Their (MWD's) biggest pool of water is not physically accessible to the San Fernando Valley but we can shift. We can make it work,\" he said.\n\nOne of the angles is to clean up the ground water basin in the Valley, buy supplemental water from MWD, blend it with the aqueduct water and deliver it to customers. LADWP can also buy water from East Los Angeles that originated in the Colorado River and pump it through an underground pipeline beneath the Santa Monica Mountains to the west San Fernando Valley, he said.\n\nOf course, Adams is concerned about using up all the reserves.\n\n\"Metropolitan has said they have enough storage for this year. The question is, how much do we use from those reservoirs? You want to use them very judiciously,\" Adams said.\n\nThe biggest losers will be farmers that do not have contracts for water from the State Water Project or the federal Central Valley Project. Both have decided not to release water to any users not signed up. Also, allocations will be drastically reduced.\n\n\"I can't impress enough how serious the situation is, particularly for agriculture in the state,\" said Shane Chapman, general manager of the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District, a wholesale water agency whose district includes about 1 million people.\n\nAbout 1.5 million acres of land could be fallowed in the agriculture-rich San Joaquin Valley, he said. Farmers will not plant some crops in order to maximize high-profit crops, such as almonds and pistachios, he said.\n\nThe recent torrential rainstorms dumped 4 inches in downtown Los Angeles and brought the season total to 5.72 inches, about 49 percent of the average, said Bill Patzert, meteorologist from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge.\n\n\"We are still 50 percent down. It is still a dry year,\" he said\n\nRainfall in the San Gabriel and Santa Monica Mountains was higher, but the runoff didn't reach the underground aquifers.\n\n\"It didn't help the drought at all. It is like trying to catch water in a champagne glass when someone is shooting a firehose at you. Most of it ends up in the ocean,\" he said.\n\nAdams would rather see the snow build up in Mammoth and the Eastern Sierra. But it will take close to 40 feet of snow there to return water supplies to normal, he said.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Flood Control District experts say they've been able to capture 100 percent of the water from the San Gabriel River during a normal year. That's because the San Gabriel and Rio Hondo rivers are mostly soft-bottomed, meaning they allow water to seep into the ground. Most of the L.A. River is concrete and impervious.\n\nWater is captured in spreading grounds -- areas of rock and gravel and berms -- that like a sponge soak water into the underground aquifer.

Instead that water was dumped into the Pacific Ocean for the amusement of the Delta Smelt. Now a natural drought has compounded the regulatory drought. And here's the simple truth of the matter.

California is basically a dry state, subject to periodic severe droughts. So, how come the largest water user is cow pasture, watered with giant sprinklers sending great sprays into the atmosphere? How come farmers irrigate those long brown furrows by flooding them, losing great quantities of water to evaporation, and bringing harmful salts to the surface? And how come some farmers even grow rice in flooded paddies, seeding them from airplanes? Why do we see so few elementary efforts to conserve water, such as drip irrigation or mulching fields to protect the soil? Why are irrigation canals not lined and covered to prevent water loss?\n\nWhy? Because California farmers get their water free, or close to free. Any of us who have taken elementary economics should be shouting from the rooftops or blasting through cyberspace: if you make something free, you will get waste and shortages!\n\nCalifornia's water crisis derives from history, ideology, and politics.\n\nHistory\n\nThe California Constitution says that the water belongs to the people. However, farmers may take water provided they put it to \"beneficial use,\" first come, first served. This is the basis of California \"water licenses\", which attach to pieces of land, dated to the time water was first \"appropriated.\" Absent any definition of \"beneficial use\", this is already a recipe for waste: A \"senior\" water license downstream, used for low-value irrigated pasture, takes precedence over a \"junior\" water license upstream, used for high-value orange groves.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nFrom 1935-55, federal agencies built many dams and canals, supplementing pre-existing farm water supply on the east side of the Central Valley. The part of that federal water that was administered by the Federal Bureau of Reclamation, however, was subject to the \"160-acre limitation,\" restricting the amount of land entitled to nearly free water to 160 acres per landowner, and limiting the term of this giveaway to 40 years. (160 acres is a quarter of a square mile.) California's giant landowners -- some left over from 1848 when the U.S. took California from Mexico, but validated the existing Spanish and Mexican land grants -- chafed under these restrictions. In the 1960's, they found a way around it: the California State Water Project (SWP). The SWP brings water from the Feather River in the Sacramento Valley south through the long-abused Sacramento delta, then pumps it up to a canal running south along the west side of the Central Valley, pumps it up again 2,000 feet over the Tehachapi mountains into Los Angeles, and conducts it even further south to San Diego. The SWP was financed by California taxpayers, frightened by claims that southern farming and then LA would dry up and blow away without an assured water supply into the 22nd century. Meanwhile, half that water has gone to irrigate the holdings of the west side land barons. These include the J. G. Boswell dynasty (200,000 acres) and their in-laws the Chandlers (145,000 acres), at that time owners of the LA Times.\n\nIdeology\n\nThe Environmental Defense Fund has proposed a \"market\" solution to the water problem: transform water licenses into secure and transferable property -- and let the market work its wonders! This is equivalent to \"cap and trade,\" which gives secure \"pollution rights\" to polluters based on their pollution history. However \"cap and trade\" at least limits pollution. \"Transferable water licenses\" simply wouldn't work. On the one hand, it would invite speculators to grab up water licenses and hold them by wasting water, creating an astronomical \"spot market\" for emergency water. On the other hand, most owners of water licenses wouldn't sell, but would rather keep on operating the old inefficient way. \"Transferable water licenses\" would lock in a system under which every subsidy and giveaway engineered by pork-barrel politics becomes sacrosanct, perpetual property, and taxpayers forever incur ongoing costs of $60 per acre-foot* or more to deliver water for $3.50 per acre-foot to landowners who can resell it for $400 per acre-foot. This is the absurd, unjust sequitur of condoning private seizure of public domain.\n\nPolitics\n\nPoor perpetually-broke California, trapped by Proposition 13 and other handcuffs on its taxing power! Yet there's liquid gold underfoot. The state could charge for water, thus recognizing that we the people own the water. Prices would depend on the region: low near the sources, and high at the end of long canals. The state could put a meter on every groundwater pump, and charge accordingly. Overnight, California's fiscal deficit would become a surplus. Yes, some water-hogging crops like rice and hay and alfalfa might move away, as they should. That would release water for the more valuable, intensive fruit and vegetable crops for which California is famous -- and which provide far more employment. The farmers might threaten to \"pass on\" higher water prices to consumers. But that's an idle threat, because shifting land and water into higher-valued and more intensive crops will raise the total supply of food marketed. And when the rains come again, the reservoirs will fill and stay filled, and all the little boats will put in again.\n\n*Enough to cover an acre a foot deep.","361":"FRESNO (AP) \u2014 Farmers holding signs protesting dramatic cuts to their irrigation supplies packed Fresno City Hall for a congressional hearing Wednesday, delving into the politics of California\u2019s drought crisis striking the state\u2019s agricultural heartland.\n\n\n\nVisalia farmer Michael Malmgren\u2019s sign had the words \u201cWater is the heart of the matter,\u201d surrounding a big, pink heart.\n\n\n\nThe House Natural Resources Committee\u2019s hearing on California\u2019s drought and the need for fixes began with statements from eight members of Congress followed by testimony from Central Valley farmers, community leaders and state officials.\n\n\n\nRepublicans dominated the spirited session.

They hope construction can start next year.\n\nHowever, the bill would not guarantee federal funding for the reservoir, which the lawmakers say will cost between $2 billion and $3 billion, although they said federal money could be available later. Likely sources of money are local water districts that will benefit from the reservoir and a state bond that is being negotiated for the November ballot.\n\nThis post contains reporting from Sasha Khokha, Craig Miller and Mina Kim of KQED News, and the Associated Press.","365":"Representatives call for more Valley water, storage\n\nDetails Published on 03\/19\/2014 - 2:19 pm Written by Business Journal Staff\n\nYoung and old carry signs calling for changes in water policy outside Wednesday's hearing.\n\nA congressional committee met at a full Fresno City Hall on Wednesday, taking up California\u2019s drought crisis and calling for freeing up more water and the construction of large reservoirs and dams.\n\nThe House Natural Resources Committee heard testimony from Central Valley farmers, community leaders and state water officials. Many speakers at the hearing titled \u201cCalifornia Water Crisis and its Impacts: The Need for Immediate and Long-Term Solutions,\u201d took sharp aim at the environmental community for becoming extreme and one-sided in its approach to water.\n\nRep. Devin Nunes, R-Fresno, charged that radicals in San Francisco and Los Angeles are dictating environmental policy for the delta region and the water systems it feeds.\n\nOutside City Hall, hundreds of sign-carrying demonstrators called for changes in how California regulates water and its uses.

The ruling went against a lower-court ruling that overturned the 2008 guidelines from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nEnvironmentalists fought to preserve those guidelines, but farmers say they're preventing vital water supplies from reaching the areas that need it most.\n\n\"I'm looking at tens of thousands of people being out of work,\" Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said. \"We're probably going to have upwards of five, six, seven hundred thousand acres of farm ground that's going to be out of production.\"\n\nAs a result of the drought and water restrictions, experts believe retail food prices could jump as much as 3.5 percent this year.\n\nIn addition to a rally on Wednesday, farmers are also testifying at a congressional field hearing about the impact of the California water crisis.\n\nEnvironmentalists hailed last week's appeals court decision.\n\nKate Poole, senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement that the drought is the problem -- not the lack of water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.\n\n\"Taking more water out of the Delta is not going to solve our problems. The emergency drought is a state-wide problem that affects all of us -- from farmers to fisherman to the average citizen. And it's the drought, not the Delta, that's affecting the water supply this year. That's why Delta fisherman and farmers support these protections -- because their jobs and livelihoods depend on it,\" she said in a statement. \"While we can't make it rain, we can take charge of our water use by investing in smart water practices that protect and preserve our water supply.\"\n\nBut others say that water is sorely needed right now.\n\n\"You're not going to grow anything with zero water, whether it's the lettuce that goes into your In-N-Out burger, whether it's the tomatoes that you use for your salsa, whether it's the nuts that you use for your health food -- all of that gets impacted here,\" Mario Santoyo, executive director of the California Latino Water Coalition, said.\n\nThat's why so many are rallying to bring attention to the problem as water deliveries dry up.\n\n\"It is true that we're in a drought condition, but it's also true there's a lot of regulations that are hampering water deliveries and really making it tough for the valley -- some of them don't make a whole lotta sense,\" Cannon Michael, with the Bowles Farming Company, said.\n\nThat makes it tough on farmers like Erskine and his son.\n\n\"I don't know what to tell him for a future,\" Erskine said. \"Don't be a farmer.

Tim Reed\/USGS\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This is the first in a three-part series examining how drought affects Native Americans and their communities. Drought maps this winter have shaded swaths of the American West in oranges and reds to signify severe, extreme and even exceptional levels of drought. And exceptional drought gets attention, especially when it hits America\u2019s vegetable basket, California\u2019s Central Valley. Speaker of the House John Boehner in January stood in his shirtsleeves in a dusty, bare field in Bakersfield. He supported a state bill that would quash salmon restoration in the San Joaquin River delta, joining the cry that scarce water should go to farms, not fish. President Barack Obama, a month later, stood in his shirtsleeves in a dusty, bare field in nearby Fresno, offering $183 million in aid and announced an initiative on climate change to address larger issues affecting the three-year drought. But living in the dry is nothing new for Native Americans in the West. Nor is being overlooked. In wet years as well as dry, many American Indians live in chronic droughtlike conditions, thanks to decades\u2019 worth of dams that hold water back or divert it from reservations which were usually sited on already marginal land. \u201cWe are definitely one of the overlooked groups of people in the U.S.,\u201d said Margaret Hiza Redsteer from her office in Flagstaff, Ariz. A member of the Crow Nation, Redsteer is a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey and has been monitoring 18 consecutive years of drought conditions in the Southwest, primarily on Hopi and Navajo lands. \u201cThe California drought is getting a lot of attention right now, and I keep thinking \u2018You know, we\u2019ve been facing this problem for a while now\u2019 \u2026 [but] we don\u2019t supply the food to the rest of the country, so people haven\u2019t noticed,\u201d she said.\n\nThe dry side of reservoirs\n\nHer concerns are echoed in the Great Plains \u2014 where reservoirs behind federal dams have displaced Indians \u2014 and in Northern California, where once teeming salmon streams shrink as water is diverted south. During the last century, California constructed a massive system of dams, reservoirs, tunnels and canals to funnel water to the Central Valley, which has become an industrial agriculture wonderland. According to the USGS California Water Science Center, Central Valley agriculture is a $17 billion per year industry that supplies a quarter of America\u2019s food, including 40 percent of its fruits and nuts. Lettuce, carrots, tomatoes and fruit take tremendous quantities of water, and the dry fields where Obama and Boehner were standing during their media events are often irrigated with water that comes from far away. In fact, 557 miles to the north, amid the forested ridges that outline the sinuous Trinity River, Rod Mendes reflected about being on the dry side of the Central Valley Project dams.\n\nPeople need to keep in mind, as [drought] legislation is drafted, that farms can be bailed out but fish populations can\u2019t. Dave Hillemeier fisheries manager, Yurok Tribe\n\n\u201cFor the most part, the Hoopa Indian Reservation is kind of in a drought situation all the time anyway,\u201d said Mendes, who is writing an emergency drought plan for the tribe. \u201cWe have a lot of dams in the area. They control the flow of the river whether we\u2019re in a drought year or not. We\u2019re not getting the flows we were getting before the dams.\u201d A half-century of lesser flows has reduced coho salmon runs to the point they are on federal and state endangered species lists. Officials with both the Hoopa and Yurok tribes say they are concerned that California\u2019s declaration of a drought emergency in January will make things worse by loosening environmental protections known as CEQA, California Environmental Quality Assurance. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned because during the process the tribes really haven\u2019t been consulted with,\u201d said Hoopa Valley tribal chairwoman Danielle Vigil-Masten. \u201cAll this legislation that\u2019s getting put through really fast. They have legislation to increase water flows into the Shasta Reservoir. They have other bills to do with the Trinity River. We have to constantly go online and look and try to understand what the information is that we are reading. We have our attorneys on it.\u201d \u201cPeople need to keep in mind, as [emergency drought] legislation is drafted, that farms can be bailed out but fish populations can\u2019t,\u201d said Dave Hillemeier, fisheries manager for the Yurok Tribe. \u201cOnce you lose the genetics that make up your fish population, they\u2019re gone.\u201d Salmon returning from the ocean last year faced such obstacles as low flows in the Trinity and Klamath rivers, higher water temperatures, algae blooms from agricultural runoff and even dewatering \u2014 stretches that were sucked dry by irrigation or consumption. \"Too much water has been allocated to too many people,\u201d said Konrad Fisher, executive director of Klamath Riverkeeper. Along the Scott River, an important tributary of the Klamath, Fisher said, \u201can 18-mile stretch \u2026 was completely dry,\u201d because of overappropriation of water rights. Dry stretches strand returning salmon, keeping them from reaching spawning grounds.\n\nTalking to the elders\n\nPressure on Northern California water may be especially dire this year. According to the California Water Science Center, \u201c2013 was the driest calendar year for California in 119 years of recorded history.\u201d Foreshadowing a bone-dry 2014, snowpack in the north ranged from 22 percent to 25 percent of normal by late February. Snowpack provides about one-third of the water used by California\u2019s cities and farms, the center said. In the Southwest, \u201cIt\u2019s a year without a winter here,\u201d Redsteer said from her USGS office in Flagstaff. She has chronicled the worsening scarcity of water by setting up her own weather stations and interviewing up to 100 tribal elders about changes they observed during their lifetimes, which included winters without snow, summers without monsoons and vanishing streams, plants and animals.\n\nOne of the ways USGS geologist Margaret Hiza Redsteer tracks climate change is by talking to Navajo and Hopi elders. U.S. Geological Survey Streams on the Navajo reservation have dried up one after another. Without moisture in the ground, perennial grasses don\u2019t grow. Without grass cover, sand dunes begin to migrate and advance on dwellings, roads and grazing land. Dry riverbeds release fine sediment to the winds, and the airborne dust settles on the snowpack of the southern Rockies. Dust absorbs more heat from the sun and melts the snow more quickly. Is it climate change? \u201cThat\u2019s the $10 million question, and frankly it\u2019s a question I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever be able to answer. It\u2019d be like trying to claim which cigarette gave the person lung cancer,\u201d Redsteer said. What can be said, she added, is that drought conditions are intensified by warmer temperatures. Plants don\u2019t remain dormant in winter anymore. They germinate and use up scant moisture. Higher temperatures increase aridity, which steals water from plants through evapotranspiration.\n\nUse it or lose it\n\nBut haven\u2019t indigenous cultures in the Southwest long adapted to arid climates? \u201cFirst of all, the traditional way of adapting to dry seasons was to move,\u201d Redsteer said. These days, \u201cIf you have a reservation, and the reservation is established where there are the most limited water resources in the region, the odds of you being able to make it through dry seasons are stacked against you.\u201d Indeed, she said, census data shows the reservation population in decline even as there are more Navajo. \u201cThere is a notable emigration from the reservation and mostly it\u2019s young people who are leaving because they can get jobs in cities,\u201d she said. This is due in part from the limited, land-based economies on the reservation. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of alternatives out there,\u201d Redsteer said. When it comes to drought planning, she praised the Navajo and Hopi tribes but added, \u201cWhat is it that we do after the first 10 years?\u201d Redsteer asked. \u201cPeople on the reservation use one-tenth of the water that people in Phoenix use every day. How do you conserve when you are already using so little? They don\u2019t have lawns, they don\u2019t wash their cars on a regular basis. It\u2019s hard to say, \u2018Well, we really need to conserve now,\u2019\u201d she said with a laugh. And Phoenix, a desert city that glimmers with emerald golf courses and backyard swimming pools when seen from the air, highlights the archaic nature of water laws. \u201cOne of the real ironies is that western water law is \u2018use it or lose it\u2019. Phoenix \u2026 to keep its Colorado River allocation, has to use that allocation or it will lose its rights to it. So in some ways there\u2019s a disincentive to conserve,\u201d Redsteer said. The aftershocks of dam building resonate throughout Indian Country, even on the Great Plains. \u201cIt is no coincidence that the major dams on the Missouri are on Indian reservations,\u201d added Gary Collins. Collins is a member of the Northern Arapaho Tribe who has spent much of his career in natural resource and water issues. \u201cActually, the tribes on the Missouri didn\u2019t get the dams, they got the reservoirs,\u201d said Bob Gough, secretary of the Intertribal Council on Utility Policy, based in Rosebud, S.D. \u201cWhen the dams were built for flood control, it actually means the tribes were permanently flooded and someone else is in control. That\u2019s what \u2018flood control\u2019 means if you are an Indian.\u201d\n\nAn ugly history\n\nCollins and Gough recently attended a drought-planning conference in Nebraska sponsored by the National Integrated Drought Information System.

The public is expected to voice their concerns on the building water tunnels, larger than any other water conveyance tubes in the world, and figure out how this will affect our communities.\n\nBut the problem is that the average California citizen has no clue what a massive project like this would do to them, much less the people in the Delta communities where this construction is taking place.\n\nThe Draft Report from the Bay Delta Conservation Plan waiting for public comment specifically says that at least four delta communities could lose \u201call\u201d access to groundwater for 10 years. That would destroy homes, small businesses and any farming industry in the area.\n\nThe reports say it completely destroys some of the delta\u2019s escape routes for flooding during that 10-year period.\n\nThis whole project will cost billions of dollars, without a public vote. No one knows for sure how it\u2019s going to be paid for.\n\nJust the cost for the half with the tunnels keeps climbing, and that\u2019s at $67 billion now.\n\nThis is not about the Water Bond coming up for a vote in November \u2014 that\u2019s the other half of this boondoggle. Reports say that only the stakeholders, the water contractors will pay for the tunnel half.\n\nReally? Around 30 water contractors will carry a $67 billion bill? Over three-quarters of state water contractors service homes and small business communities. How can these water districts pay for this boondoggle without doubling or tripling their water bills to an Alameda home owner, or a Napa County business owner?\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the tunnels are a state project (State Water Project, SWP), not a federal project (Central Valley Project, CVP).\n\nSeventy-five percent of CVP water from Northern California goes to two major water agencies who supply farmers along the west side of the San Joaquin Valley.\n\nYes, CVP water will benefit greatly because they will get these tunnels, but they will not be paying for this mammoth construction project. Only SWP contractors will.\n\nCongressman Devin Nunes from Bakersfield, a district that gets a great deal of CVP water, says that this is an issue is about \u201cstupid little fish.\u201d He\u2019s referring to the restrictions on killing smelt fish.\n\nThe CVP water contractors (Yes, the CVP who is not paying for this) want to move their pumping station up to Sacramento area and suck out the fresh water without being responsible for the seawater and smelt that backfills the missing water in the delta and the delta communities.\n\nWhen that happens, the rest of the state has to flush out the delta with what water we have left.\n\nGiving the CVP water contractors, with federal contracts, priority over fresh water makes it \u201csenior\u201d rights over Sacramento River water, and the Northern California counties, with state contracts, will have junior rights.\n\nThe Delta plan doesn\u2019t ask for public comment about that, and that\u2019s what we should be talking about.\n\nPat Snelling lives in Garden Valley, Calif.","388":"Thanks to February storms, state officials are slightly easing drought restrictions on water deliveries, but the changes won't make a difference to most of the state.\n\nThe prime beneficiaries will be Central Valley irrigation districts with the most senior water rights.\n\nAlthough last month's above average rainfall in Northern California improved the water supply picture somewhat, officials Tuesday continued to predict that the big state and federal water projects that help supply a majority of Californians will deliver little or no water to most agricultural and urban agencies this year.\n\nStill, state officials said they had grown more confident that there was enough water in reservoirs to meet human health and safety needs and provide some supplies for senior rights holders in the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys.\n\nOn Jan. 31, the State Water Resources Control Board issued an emergency drought order, restricting exports from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta to those necessary to meet drinking water and sanitation needs. The curbs were intended to maintain enough fresh water in the delta, the state's water hub, to prevent seawater from contaminating drinking supplies.\n\nThe restrictions, which eliminated exports to even senior agricultural districts in the San Joaquin Valley, were triggered for less than two weeks before February storms dumped enough water into the system to preserve delta water quality without them.\n\nOn Tuesday, Tom Howard, the water board's executive director, signed two amendments to the emergency order. One change allows delta exports beyond human health and safety needs. The second relaxes seasonal environmental requirements for delta outflow that are about to take effect.\n\nOfficials said they had cleared the revisions with federal fishery agencies that oversee endangered species protections in the delta.\n\nIn two weeks, the Central Valley Project, which primarily serves irrigation districts, and the California State Water Project, which delivers Northern California supplies to the Southland, will update water allocations that were initially set at zero for most agencies.\n\n\"My expectation is that that zero probably will not change\" for the state project, and \"if it does change, not significantly,\" said Mark Cowin, director of the California Department of Water Resources.\n\nbettina.boxall@latimes.com","389":"When it comes to water, we\u2019re so desperate for good news that even not-so-bad news sounds good.","390":"Best Activities This Weekend In Orange County - February 10 With no shortage of exciting things to explore, Orange County has plenty to offer regardless of your preference.\n\nBest Places For Last Minute Valentine Day Gifts In Orange CountyLast minute Valentine's gift givers don\u2019t really need to give it too much thought as there are plenty of last minute gifts you can get your loved one this year in Orange County.","391":"Officials say February's rain storms pleasantly boosted the state's water supply, but California remains in the throes of a drought.\n\nTom Howard, executive officer of the State Water Resources Control Board, says he will sign an order allowing water to be pumped from the San Joaquin Delta.

But plans are now in place to assist landowners that store water for use later in the season through a state program.\n\nThe California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) and the State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board) announced that they will expedite approval for the installation of storage tanks by landowners who currently divert water from these important rivers and streams. The action comes under the State Water Board's Small Domestic Use (SDU) registration program.\n\nInstalling tanks to divert and store water when flows are higher will help improve rural water supply reliability and fire safety while also relieving pressure for in-stream diversions during the drier months when fish need it most.\n\nThe State Water Board has an existing statewide registration program for domestic use of water, allowing home water uses such as drinking and fire protection. These small domestic registrations must comply with general conditions from the State Water Board and typically receive project specific conditions from CDFW.\n\nLandowners eligible for the SDU program currently can request approval to divert to storage. However, this can be a lengthy process requiring site-specific evaluations that address in-stream and habitat needs.\n\nWith this recent action, CDFW has essentially \"pre-approved\" the installation of storage tanks that meet the general criteria. The State Water Board has agreed to incorporate these criteria as conditions of approval, and to expedite the issuance of the registrations. This action will result in the collection of water during any upcoming precipitation events, taking advantage of higher flows, and using the stored water later in the season when there may be little to no water available.\n\nSome of these water tanks can provide months of storage to meet domestic water supply needs.\n\n\"We have been working in these coastal communities for many years, and have good reason to believe that these emergency changes are going to be welcomed,\" said Charlton H. Bonham, director of CDFW. \"Many landowners who have wanted to take these steps can do so now more quickly with greater regulatory certainty from our department.\"\n\nThis action is designed to capture water when it is raining and right after rain events. It is not designed to expand any applicant's existing water right or amount of diversion. Capturing rain when it falls from the sky and storing it for use later can also help reduce the impacts to fish and wildlife from diverting water from streams during the driest times of the summer. This action was the direct result of suggestions made by local communities and fish conservation organizations such as Trout Unlimited, Mattole River Restoration Council, Sanctuary Forest and the Salmonid Restoration Federation.\n\n\"The drought is going to be really hard for fish and wildlife as well as agriculture and people,\" said State Water Board executive officer Tom Howard. \"CDFW and the State Water Board are open to any solution from any corner of the state on how to make it through these tough times together.\"\n\nExpedited permitting is available to applicants that meet all of the criteria set forth in the program. SDU program eligibility can be found at http:\/\/www.waterboards.ca.gov\/waterrights\/waterissues\/programs\/registrations\/.\n\nEligible parties are those that are already diverting from a stream under a riparian basis of right in CDFW Regions 1 or 3. The party should be diverting for domestic and fire protection use only, and has or will install a rigid style water storage tank. The storage tank should be big enough in size to store at least 60 days of water supply for the house.\n\nParties who are eligible will need to accept the general CDFW conditions, most importantly that they will use the stored water as a substitute for withdrawing additional water during the summer when flows are lowest. The State Water Board will expedite processing of registration forms where the party meets the CDFW eligibility criteria.\n\nThis will help protect fish during periods of low stream flow, especially this year with the drought conditions.\n\nWith California facing one of the most severe droughts on record, Governor Brown declared a drought state of emergency and directed state officials to take all necessary actions to prepare for water shortages. The governor signed legislation to immediately help communities deal with the devastating dry conditions affecting our state and to provide funding to increase local water supplies after it was passed with bipartisan support in the legislature.\n\nGovernor Brown met with President Obama about crucial federal support during the ongoing drought, and the state continues to work with federal partners to ensure coordinated drought monitoring and response. Governor Brown and the administration have also expressed support for federal legislation introduced by Senators Feinstein and Boxer and representatives Jim Costa, Tony C\u00e1rdenas and Sam Farr.\n\nAcross state government, action is being taken. The Department of General Services is leading water conservation efforts at state facilities, and the California State Architect has asked California school districts and Community Colleges to act on the governor's call to reduce water usage. The Department of Transportation is cutting water usage along California's roadways by 50 percent. Caltrans has also launched a public awareness campaign, putting a water conservation message on their more than 700 electronic highway signs.\n\nIn January, the state took action to conserve water in numerous Northern California reservoirs to meet minimum needs for operations impacting the environment and the economy, and recently the Department of Water Resources and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation announced they would seek the authority to make water exchanges to deliver water to those who need it most. The State Water Resources Control Board announced it would work with hydropower generators and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to preserve water in California reservoirs, and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the California Fish and Game Commission restricted fishing on some waterways due to low water flows worsened by the drought.\n\nThe state is working to protect local communities from the dangers of extreme drought. The California Department of Public Health identified and offered assistance to communities at risk of severe drinking water shortages and is working with other state and local agencies to develop solutions for vulnerable communities. Cal Fire hired additional firefighters and is continuously adjusting staffing throughout the state to help address the increased fire threat due to drought conditions. The California Department of Food and Agriculture launched a drought website to help farmers, ranchers and farm workers find resources and assistance programs that may be available to them during the drought.\n\nEven as the state deals with the immediate impacts of the drought, it is also planning for the future. In 2013, the California Natural Resources Agency, the California Environmental Protection Agency and CDFA released the California Water Action Plan, which will guide state efforts to enhance water supply reliability, restore damaged and destroyed ecosystems and improve the resilience of our infrastructure.\n\nGovernor Brown has called on all Californians to voluntarily reduce their water usage by 20 percent, and the Save Our Water campaign launched four public service announcements encouraging residents to conserve and has resources available in Spanish. Last December, the governor formed a drought task force to review expected water allocations and California's preparedness for water scarcity. In May 2013, Governor Brown issued an executive order to direct state water officials to expedite the review and processing of voluntary transfers of water.","393":"California drought: Solar desalination plant shows promise Solar desalination system appears to be cost-effective\n\nFirebaugh, Fresno County --\n\nQuietly whirring away in a dusty field in the Central Valley is a shiny solar energy machine that may someday solve many of California's water problems.\n\nIt's called the WaterFX solar thermal desalination plant, and it has been turning salty, contaminated irrigation runoff into ultra-pure liquid for nearly a year for the Panoche Water and Drainage District. It's the only solar-driven desalination plant of its kind in the country.\n\nRight now its efforts produce just 14,000 gallons a day. But within a year, WaterFX intends to begin expanding that one small startup plant into a sprawling collection of 36 machines that together can pump out 2 million gallons of purified water daily.\n\nWithin about five years, WaterFX company co-founder Aaron Mandell hopes to be processing 10 times that amount throughout the San Joaquin Valley. And here's the part that gets the farmers who buy his water most excited: His solar desalination plant produces water that costs about a quarter of what more conventionally desalinated water costs: $450 an acre-foot versus $2,000 an acre-foot.\n\nAn acre-foot is equivalent to an acre covered by water 1 foot deep, enough to supply two families of four for a year.\n\nCompetitive price\n\nThat brings Mandell's water cost close to what farmers are paying, in wet years, for water from the Panoche and other valley districts - about $300 an acre-foot. And that makes it a more economically attractive option than any of the 17 conventional desalination plants planned throughout California.\n\nIf Mandell can pull it off, the tiny farming town where he is starting his enterprise could be known as ground zero for one of the most revolutionary water innovations in the state's history.\n\n\"Eventually, if this all goes where I think it can, California could wind up with so much water it's able to export it instead of having to deal with shortages,\" Mandell said, standing alongside the 525-foot-long solar reflector that is the heart of his machine. \"What we are doing here is sustainable, scalable and affordable.\"\n\nDennis Falaschi, manager of the Panoche district, and many of the 60 farmers that constitute his customer base say the sooner WaterFX expands, the better.\n\nSaving water\n\nPanoche expects to deliver about 45,000 acre-feet of water this year to its growers. That total is half of what the growers get in wetter years - but because drought and environmentally driven water mandates are not unique to 2014, the district's farmers are already ahead of the curve on water preservation techniques.\n\nMost use drip irrigation instead of water-intensive sprinklers and are hooked up to an unusual drainage system that captures used irrigation water and directs it into fields of wheatgrass, a salt-tolerant crop sold for cattle feed. But that drainage system is little more than a creative way to get rid of irrigation water that's too salty for most uses once it leaches through farm soil.\n\nFinding a way to make it suitable for people to drink and use on the crops they eat would be a breakthrough, Falaschi said.\n\n\"It appears this solar system will be cost-effective, and if Aaron can perform as we think he can, it can make a huge difference - be a great supplement at the very least,\" he said. \"We're talking about basically unusable drainage water that is in everybody's interest to mine.\n\n\"This solar plant could be a very important part of where we want to be in terms of being self-sufficient in the valley.\"\n\nNothing from feds\n\nPanoche, like many districts in the Central Valley - the nation's most productive agricultural zone - has traditionally bought most of its water from the federally run Central Valley Project. But in this drought year, farmers are likely to get zero allocation from the project.\n\nIf that happens, Panoche will have to draw from leftover supply, the expensive spot water market and wells. All of that is pricier than usual, with the spot market alone charging as much as $3,500 an acre-foot.\n\n\"This situation right now is a killer, and anything that adds to a potential water supply is good,\" said Mike Stearns, a fourth-generation farmer in the Panoche district who is fallowing most of his tomato, onion and other fields this year because of the drought. He's concentrating on his wine grapes, which are thirsty but promise a good profit even in a drought year.\n\n\"And keep in mind that this water shortage doesn't just affect farmers,\" Stearns said. \"Think about the jobs that are lost when we have to fallow our fields. Or the taxes that the government won't get because we aren't growing and selling. It's bad. We need to do everything we can about this.\"\n\nSimple process\n\nThe way the solar plant works is simple, which is why the water it produces is cheap.\n\nWater that dribbles down from nearby hills, and through the soil in the Central Valley after being used for irrigation, collects so much salt, selenium, boron and other minerals that it's not fit for human consumption. The solar plant captures the foothill runoff and sucks in used irrigation water from a French drain-style system 6 to 8 feet under the crops, and sends that tainted water through a series of pipes and tanks that heat it.\n\nThe heat comes from the plant's huge, parabolic-shaped solar reflector, which focuses the sun on a long tube containing mineral oil. That heated tube in turn creates steam, which condenses the brackish water into usable liquid, separating out the minerals.\n\nThe water then goes back out for irrigation. Mandell says that because his condensation method distills the minerals more efficiently than other desalination methods, he is installing a system that will process them for use. Selenium and boron can be vitamin supplements, for example, and gypsum can be used for drywall.\n\nMore conventional desalination plants - such as a $1 billion operation being built near San Diego - use a reverse osmosis process, in which brackish water is forced through screens to filter out the contaminants. That requires a lot of energy, which is why it is more expensive.\n\nRaising money\n\nWaterFX's pilot plant cost $1 million in state grants to build last summer. The expansion of the 36-plant complex would cost as much as $30 million, which Mandell is working on raising.\n\n\"It does seem like this system is in a great location,\" said Daniel Choi, an analyst with Lux Research, which researches emerging technology. \"It's where it should be - an area with a lot of sunlight, where reverse osmosis doesn't make the most sense large-scale. It does seem like it's viable.\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised if WaterFX expanded to other markets.\"\n\nMandell's expanded solar plant would be able to deliver 2,200 acre-feet of water next year - and if that performs as hoped, within a few years his ambition is to scale it up to 20,000 acre-feet. That would meet nearly half of the current demand from Panoche district farmers.\n\n\"Eventually we could process not just drainage water, but industrial and residential wastewater as well as groundwater that now is too salty to use,\" Mandell said. Such desalination already happens on a large scale in other parts of the world, particularly the Middle East, he pointed out.\n\nSinking land\n\nDrawing groundwater, however - even groundwater that's now too salty to drink - could prove problematic in the Central Valley. Years of tapping usable groundwater have so depleted aquifers that in some places the land has sunk 30 feet since the 1920s.\n\nThere are trillions of gallons of brackish groundwater available in California, said Claudia Faunt, a U.S. Geological Survey hydrologist, and much of that has not been tapped because it is closer to the surface than the purer liquid deeper down. However, \"to say there wouldn't be subsidence (if it were tapped) is an unknown,\" she said.\n\nFor now, Mandell said, he and his partners are focusing on drainage water - and that alone is a major issue.\n\n\"Look, there are 200 million tons of salt on the land in the Central Valley, and billions of gallons of drainage water, and cleaning up that drainage water is a huge issue,\" said WaterFX's chief consultant, Bruce Marlow. \"I'd say if we can control the saline in the valley, in 10 years we might not have to rely on the federal water system here at all.\"\n\nOnline extra: For more on California's water issues, go to SFGate.com\/drought.","394":"Group calls for drought relief for Delta farmers\n\n\u2022 Restore the Delta says federal attention should include victims north of the San Joaquin Valley \u2022 \u0093We are on the verge of losing Delta farms and our salmon and other fisheries\u0094\n\nFRESNOMarch 18, 2014 12:09pmAn environmental group critical of efforts to increase water pumping from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta says the federal government should help Delta and northern California farmers suffering from the drought, not just those on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley.\n\nThe group says it will call on the federal government to provide drought relief to Delta farmers and business owners, and to stop focusing solely on aiding Westlands Water District and other west San Joaquin Valley growers at a hearing Wednesday in Fresno of the House Committee on Natural Resources.\n\n\u0093We are on the verge of losing Delta farms and our salmon and other fisheries.

The instability of the state\u2019s decades-old water system, in Ziegler\u2019s view, can even be summed up in a single number: 1.5 million.\n\n\u201cThe most conservative estimate you hear is that our water system is 1.5 million acre-feet out of balance in an average year\u2014even before the dramatic acceleration of well-digging and development we\u2019ve seen during the past two years of drought ,\u201d says Ziegler, director of external affairs and policy at the Nature Conservancy, a longstanding Economic Summit environmental partner. \u201cIn other words, we\u2019re taking more water out of the ground than Mother Nature is putting in on a sustainable basis.\u201d And not just a little more: 1.5 million acre-feet is about as much water as two to three million households use in a year.\n\nWith this daunting number in mind, the Nature Conservancy is pushing state leaders this year to make water investments that support communities most impacted by drought, while also more sustainably meeting California\u2019s needs\u2014\u201cfor people, for farms, and for the environment,\u201d as Ziegler puts it. The leaders of the Economic Summit shared a similar view in a February letter to the governor and Legislative leaders.\n\nZiegler is quick to acknowledge that the administration\u2014and the leaders of the governor's drought task force, in particular\u2014seem to share the Nature Conservancy\u2019s long view on water issues. It was the California Department of Water Resources, after all, that produced the study in 1998 estimating a statewide \u201coverdraft\u201d of 1.5 million acre-foot each year. The governor\u2019s updated California Water Action Plan, released in January, emphasizes the importance of \u201csustainable\u201d water policies that strike a balance between public health, protecting the environment, and supporting a stable California economy.\n\n\u201cMany of these proposals are very positive and on track to achieve a more sustainable water balance\u2014and provide for a bright future for California,\u201d says Ziegler. \u201cWe are particularly pleased that Gov. Brown has approached the Water Plan on a system-wide basis\u2014integrating strategies from upper watersheds, where 60 percent of California\u2019s water supply falls as snow and precipitation, to urban water resources management in a more holistic way.\u201d\n\nGetting more specific about state water goals\n\nBut there is more that can be done, and Ziegler and the Nature Conservancy are pushing state leaders to be even more specific about the state\u2019s water goals\u2014and exactly how they can be accomplished. The Conservancy laid out its proposals in a December letter to the administration that called for a \u201cvision statement\u201d for state water policy that would mobilize water managers around a single objective: getting the water system back in balance.\n\nThe letter even put a number on it (one that will sound familiar): The Nature Conservancy called on the state to support a blend of conservation actions, water-use reductions, and alternative water supplies that will generate at least 1.5 million acre-feet of water over the next five years.\n\nThere are ways the state can get this done, says Ziegler, but it will take more than simply putting money into existing storage facilities or even the water recycling and reuse projects supported by environmentalists. Instead, Ziegler thinks the state needs to take a fresh look at the situation: \u201cFirst, we need to recognize what\u2019s happening by understanding our water balance in a much more specific way so we all understand the linkage between groundwater and surface water resources. Based on that understanding, we can all develop and \u2018buy into\u2019 a smarter and more sustainable water management strategy with appropriate roles for water management agencies, local government, and state agencies.\u201d\n\nZiegler hopes to start where the biggest problem is: groundwater. Unlike the dams and aqueducts most people associate with water infrastructure, the invisible groundwater system is the source of water for almost half the state\u2019s population in dry years. As the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office pointed out in a report released this week, it\u2019s also the least-regulated and least-understood part of the water system. The state doesn\u2019t currently have a statewide method of regulating groundwater use, and its locally-based approach to monitoring is still largely voluntarily. Even more important is the disconnect between groundwater law and water science: The state manages surface water and groundwater separately, even though groundwater levels have a substantial impact on the flow of water on the surface and vice versa.\n\nDrought emergency legislation enacted this month offered the promise of some action on these issues\u2014making groundwater recharge projects eligible for $472 million in grant funds, while also allocating $14 million for groundwater management.\n\nA statewide approach to groundwater\n\nZiegler, though, believes these efforts could be more focused: \u201cThe administration has drawn attention to those areas where we know groundwater basins are most out of balance\u2014the lower San Joaquin and some places on the Central Coast. That is understandable, but we need to take a larger, statewide look at groundwater resources. Given the time it takes for groundwater basins to recover\u2014it may be 20 years\u2014we may be at a tipping point in managing groundwater in some places where we can better manage water resources to avert tomorrow\u2019s crisis and make sure that we have water in the ground when our next drought occurs.\u201d\n\nTo accomplish this, the Conservancy is pushing the state to expand its approach to managing groundwater. \u201cIt would be a mistake just to focus on the most distressed areas today and miss areas that may be in decline,\u201d says Ziegler. But without robust groundwater monitoring and management, the state can\u2019t be sure which basins are in balance and which are in decline. \u201cWe need a broader strategy to identify areas where we need to invest in monitoring, water conservation, managed groundwater recharge efforts, alternative supply, and water storage strategies. If we look at this drought like a \u2018fire alarm,\u2019 we need to do much more than just put out the current fire.\u201d\n\nThe Nature Conservancy hopes to convince state leaders to allocate more funds for groundwater monitoring in the current budget and other state actions this year. Such a program could be funded through legislation or a revamped water bond. The Conservancy is also working with the Summit to expand local financing authorities that could allow regions to do more not just to monitor groundwater\u2014but to protect wildlife, restore natural ecosystems, and prepare for the next drought.\n\n\u201cTo do any of that,\u201d says Ziegler, \u201cyou have to go back to monitoring: We have to get to a place where we have much better understanding of regional water supply, demands on that supply and use information for better water management\u2014both regionally and on a statewide basis. We are at risk of focusing in one place while tomorrow\u2019s crisis goes without notice for too long.\u201d\n\nA crisis that could be even more daunting if the state keeps depleting its water resources at a rate of 1.5 million acre-feet a year.\n\nCategories: Water","396":"Page not found\n\nSorry.

This service isn\u2019t cheap, some \u2018water witches\u201d charge as much as $500 per visit, reports the AP.\n\nBut that barely scratches the surface on the extreme measures California has taken.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, state officials announced they would cut off water to local agencies for the first time, according to the New York Times.\n\n\"It is the first time in the 54-year history of the State Water Project that water allocations to all of the public water agencies it serves have been cut to zero. That decision will force 29 local agencies to look elsewhere for water. Most have other sources they can draw from, such as groundwater and local reservoirs,\" the report said.\n\nThe State Water Project \"is the infrastructure agency that parcels out the water that comes mainly from winter rains and snowfall to water agencies serving cities and agricultural areas. Because precipitation has been rare this winter, there is virtually no hope supplies for the dry summer will be adequate,\" UPI explained.\n\nThe decision to suspend water distribution to agencies aims to \"conserve what little water is left in state reservoirs,\" PBS reported.\n\nMeanwhile, the state is pouring funds into drought relief. Last week, Governor Jerry Brown signed major funding legislation. \"The largest share of the drought relief package - $549 million - comes from accelerated spending of bond money voters previously approved in two ballot propositions,\" Reuters reported.","398":"In an effort to promote water conservation during the state's ongoing drought, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife joined the State Water Resources Control Board in a decision Monday to speed the approval of domestic water storage tank installations.\n\nFish and Wildlife spokeswoman Jordan Traverso said that the decision is one of many \"necessary steps to conserve water and help fish during an unprecedented drought.\"\n\n\"The idea behind it is that while there is still water in the streams, to have people storing it as quickly as possible,\" Traverso said. \"We're concerned that there is not going to be enough water for them to store later during the drier summers when the fish will need it.\"\n\nThe decision alters eligibility requirements for the water board's small domestic use registration program, which allows landowners with existing water rights to divert water from streams and rivers and store it for home use and fire protection purposes. In order to be approved for storage installation under the program, landowners had to comply with both the water board's conditions and more site-specific requirements under Fish and Wildlife. Under the new program, Fish and Wildlife has made its requirements more generalized to allow for quicker processing.\n\nState Water Board spokesman George Kostyrko said the program would also call for landowners to alter their storage schedules to take advantage of the rainy season and its resulting high water flows.\n\n\"Under this program, they would not divert during the summer, and instead divert more during the winter and hold it in the tank for summer use,\" Kostyrko said.\n\nThe program only applies to counties within Fish and Wildlife's designated northern and bay delta regions -- which include Humboldt County.\n\nInput from several communities and conservation organizations -- including Mattole River Sanctuary Forest -- helped to bring about this change, according to Traverso. Sanctuary Forest Executive Director Tasha McKee said she was \"thrilled\" with the outcome, but said \"it won't be enough\" unless more action is taken.\n\n\"The big message here is that the departments that permit on the state level have put their best foot forward to respond to the drought,\" she said. \"The county needs to put their best foot forward now. I hope all the other levels of government can seize the moment and do the right thing.\"\n\nMcKee said Sanctuary Forest -- a public benefit corporation based in Whitethorn -- has been working since 2002 to educate and assist people interested in water storage as well as working to convince the state to give incentives to those who do install the tanks. From 2007 to 2013, McKee said Sanctuary Forest has aided the installation of 18 tanks on several properties, which have collectively stored about one million gallons of water.\n\nBut with the county viewing water tank installations as property improvements, it opens up the landowner to increased property taxes on top of the already expensive installation prices. McKee said this tax increase is like a \"slap in the face\" to those working to both conserve water and protect the environment.\n\n\"You have to spend a lot of money to get these installed, but people still get higher property taxes,\" McKee said.\n\nSecond District Supervisor Estelle Fennell -- who also serves on the county's water storage ad hoc committee -- said Monday's decision was a \"step in the right direction,\" but also said taxation was acting as a deterrent.\n\n\"We're discussing anything we can do to in regards to permitting or tax relief that will lessen the burden and encourage people to actually go forward with water storage,\" Fennell said.\n\nMore information on the state water board's small domestic use registration program can be found at http:\/\/www.waterboards.ca.gov\/waterrights\/water_issues\/programs\/registrations.\n\nWill Houston can be reached at 707-441-0504 or whouston@times-standard.com.

Instead of flowing into storm drains and washing out to sea, an oversized tank harvested the precious resource to keep her thirsty citrus trees and vegetables from shriveling up on dry days.\n\nAcross Santa Monica, backyard rain barrels and cisterns are becoming fashionable. Since 2010, the beach city has doled out 385 rebates to homeowners who direct rainwater back into their gardens as part of a broader effort to become water independent that also includes cleaning up contaminated groundwater and recycling water.\n\n\"This is kind of a no-brainer, low-hanging fruit solution for anyone,\" said Miller, who three years ago installed a 205-gallon water storage container, which resembles an upright accordion.\n\nCalifornia is gripped by historic parched conditions that have desiccated farmland, dried up reservoirs and forced rural communities to ration water. A welcome dousing late last month did little to break the arid spell.\n\nEven before this latest drought emergency, some agencies that historically draw their water from the overtapped Colorado River and Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta have taken steps to slash their dependence on water from outside sources and boost their own supplies. Past drought woes, particularly in the late 1980s and early 1990s, have forced some communities to rethink where their water comes from, and they're increasingly realizing local sources are insurance against future dry weather.\n\nSanta Monica, population 92,000, has perhaps the loftiest goal: to completely wean itself off outside water by 2020. The city long depended on its groundwater wells, but supplies became polluted in the mid-1990s from underground gasoline storage tank leaks and the addition of a fuel additive.\n\nThe contamination forced Santa Monica to buy most of its water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, a giant wholesaler that provides drinking water to nearly 19 million people in six counties. Meanwhile, the city used proceeds from settlements with oil companies responsible for the pollution to purge the wells. The cleanup, completed three years ago, allows the city to tap groundwater for up to 70 percent of its water needs.\n\nAbout 50 miles to the northwest, the semi-agricultural community of Camarillo receives about 60 percent of its water from the State Water Project -- a maze of dams, pipes and canals that carries snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada and transports it to points south -- that it blends with salty groundwater sources.\n\nThe Southern California port city of Long Beach, which relies on outside water for 40 percent of its drinking water, studied the possibility of building a desalination plant, which separates salt from ocean water. But it was too expensive, and the city is now focused on increasing groundwater supplies.\n\nA recent amendment to a court order deciding groundwater rights would allow Long Beach to pump more water. It's in the very early stages of drawing up a multimillion-dollar plan to build miles of pipelines to move the water.\n\nWhile maximizing groundwater is key to cutting down on distant imports, which can be fickle depending on the weather, it's not an option for every community.\n\nGroundwater is \"not available everywhere and it also depends on the quality,\" said Jennifer Persike, a spokeswoman for the Association of California Water Agencies. \"You have to be careful not to overpump it.\"\n\nWhile Santa Monica bets on groundwater, it's also investing in other water conservation tactics, including recycling and rain harvesting. Near the touristy Santa Monica Pier, a water recycling plant treats excess irrigation and other urban runoff that is then used to water parks, school grounds and a cemetery.\n\nThe city also collects rain. The main library has a 200,000-gallon underground cistern that captures raindrops to water the gardens. Last year, officials installed a smaller cistern that will fill toilets at a newly built library scheduled to open next month.\n\nSince 1997, the city code requires that new construction and remodeled homes must catch the first quarter inch of rain.\n\nDuring a recent downpour in late February, Miller checked on her cistern, which she bought from a hardware store and installed by rerouting the downspout. She paid $571 for the tank, which is bolted to the side of her house for earthquake safety, and the city reimbursed her $250. As rain funneled from the roof into the beige cistern, water from neighboring houses coursed down the street like a river.\n\nThough Miller's yard consists mostly of cactus and succulents -- she's in the process of ripping up the last patch of grass -- there are orange, lemon and kumquat trees, and a small vegetable bed of green beans, sweet peas and snap peas that need water. A full tank typically can last for months, allowing Miller to tend to her water-needy trees and vegetables on rainless days.\n\nWhile rainwater capture does little to affect the water table, it does reduce potable water demand.\n\n\"I don't think it's as dramatic as buying an electric car, but if everyone in LA did it, imagine the water savings there would be,\" she said.\n\nSanta Monica officials estimate that rain harvesting, low-flow toilets and other conservation measures save the city about $326,000 per year. If the city becomes self-sufficient by 2020 as planned mainly by tapping groundwater, it is expected to save $3 million per year.\n\n\"Every drop counts,\" water resources manager Gil Borboa said.\n\nCalifornia's drought has caught the attention of foreign leaders. During a recent three-day swing through California, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Gov. Jerry Brown that the semi-arid country has no water troubles because it emphasizes desalination, wastewater recycling, irrigation that uses less water than traditional sprinklers and other measures.\n\nKevin Wattier, Long Beach Water Department general manager, said incentives are important, but there's no substitute for educating people to stop watering sidewalks.\n\n\"People need to quit wasting water. It's that simple,\" he
