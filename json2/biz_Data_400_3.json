The Dreamliner was grounded for more than three months after jets owned by Japanese airlines had problems with their lithium-ion batteries. (Photo: David McNew, Getty Images)\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing announced Wednesday that the Boeing 787 is safe after a comprehensive review of the Dreamliner because of initial problems with its lithium-ion battery.\n\n\"We do conclude that the aircraft is safe and that it meets its intended level of design and safety,\" FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said.\n\nThe FAA review of the design, manufacture and assembly of the 787 began Jan. 11, 2013, four days after a lithium battery fire aboard an empty Japan Airlines jet parked in Boston. Then an All Nippon Airways flight made an emergency landing in Japan on Jan. 16, 2013, because of a smoldering battery.\n\nThe review wasn't limited to the battery or electrical system, and, while the entire plane was deemed safe, Huerta didn't discuss the battery specifically because those incidents remain under investigation\n\nThe 71-page report that resulted from the review made seven recommendations for FAA and Boeing basically to focus their inspections and oversight more on higher-risk areas of a plane as it is developed. These areas are where less is known about the material or equipment, so there is not as much familiarity with how it will operate.\n\n\"We concluded that the aircraft was soundly designed, and that Boeing and the FAA had processes in place that were designed to identify and correct any issue that might arise during the manufacturing process,\" Huerta said. \"It's many layered. You don't have single points of failure.\"\n\nBoeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Ray Conner said the company has already taken significant steps to implement its recommendations, such as improving the flow of information, standards and expectations with suppliers.\n\n\"The findings validate our confidence in both the design of the airplane and the disciplined process used to identify and correct in-service issues as they arise,\" Conner said.\n\nHenry Harteveldt, an industry analyst with Hudson Crossing, said the report confirms Boeing and its partners did their jobs. He compared the 787 with a model-plane kit because parts of the fuselage, wings, landing gear and avionics flow in from thousands of sub-suppliers.\n\n\"It is truly an aircraft that is going to change how all kinds of commercial aircraft are designed and built,\" Harteveldt said. \"It's understandable that some glitches occur. It's disconcerting that some of these problems are basic.\"\n\nThe FAA grounded the first six jets in the USA for more than three months, which led to a worldwide hiatus in flights for 49 planes.\n\nWithout knowing precisely what caused the problem, Boeing developed more insulation between each battery's cells and a fireproof shell for the battery to starve it of oxygen if there is a fire. The improvements were added before the plane returned to the skies.\n\nEach jet carries two batteries, which are surrounded by a stainless steel box. Each battery has a titanium venting tube to a hole in the fuselage to carry flammable electrolytes and smoke overboard if a battery fails.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board continues to investigate the cause of the Boston fire. Another battery problem surfaced in January on a Japan Airlines jet parked in Tokyo, where Boeing discovered during routine maintenance that one cell of a battery released gas.\n\nThe Dreamliner is an innovative jet built largely from composite material, which makes it lighter and 20% more fuel-efficient. Passengers like the jet's quietness in flight and its larger windows equipped with electronic dimmers rather than shades.\n\nBoeing delivered 65 of the jets last year and expects to deliver 110 this year. The company wants to sell 3,300 of the jets during the next 20 years.\n\nRead or Share this story: http:\/\/usat.ly\/1gPKmfU","1":"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Boeing's design and manufacture of its cutting-edge 787 jetliner is safe despite the many problems encountered since the plane's rollout, including a fire that forced a redesign of the its batteries, according to a report issued jointly Wednesday by the Federal Aviation Administration and the aircraft maker.\n\nThe yearlong review concluded \"the aircraft was soundly designed, met its intended safety level, and that the manufacturer and the FAA had effective processes in place to identify and correct issues that emerged before and after certification,\" the agency said in a statement.\n\nFAA Administrator Michael Huerta asked for the review in January 2013 after a lithium-ion battery caught fire on a 787 parked at Logan International Airport in Boston. A battery aboard another 787 failed less than two weeks later. Airlines around the world temporarily ground their 787 fleets after the incidents.\n\nThe 787, Boeing's newest and most technologically advanced plane, has been hit by a variety of technical and safety glitches since its launch in 2011. It is the first airliner to make extensive use of lithium-ion batteries. Since the FAA didn't have safety regulations for those batteries as installed equipment in planes when the 787 was designed, the agency and Boeing jointly developed the special safety conditions the plane's battery system should meet.\n\nAfter the battery failures, the FAA was criticized for relying too heavily on designated Boeing employees to ensure the safety of the plane's design and manufacture.\n\n\"The (report's) findings validate our confidence in both the design of the airplane and the disciplined process used to identify and correct in-service issues as they arise,\" said Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Ray Conner.\n\nA National Transportation Safety Board investigation into the battery fire in Boston is still underway. Wednesday's report was not intended to address the battery's design, but rather the overall safety of Boeing's design and manufacture of the plane and the adequacy of FAA's oversight.\n\nThe report also makes several recommendations for improvement by Boeing and FAA. It says Boeing should ensure suppliers are fully aware of their responsibilities, establish a way to ensure suppliers identify realistic risks, and require suppliers to follow industry standards for personnel performing Boeing-required inspections.\n\nThe report recommended that the FAA make changes to its oversight of the safety certification of new planes to take into account \"new aircraft manufacturing business models.\"\n\nBoeing extensively outsourced the manufacture of many elements of the 787 to overseas suppliers. Suppliers sometimes then outsourced portions of their work to other companies.\n\nAnother report recommendation is that the FAA revise its production approval procedures \"to more fully address complex, large-scale manufacturers with extended supply chains.\"\n\nLast month, an Air India Dreamliner, flying nonstop from Sydney to Delhi, with 215 people on board, landed in Kuala Lumpur under emergency conditions after its cockpit panels suffered a software malfunction. There was a third battery incident in Japan in January, but Boeing officials said the problem appeared to have been contained by the new battery design.\n\nMore from MBTMag.com\n\nCEOs' Optimism On Economy At 2-Year High\n\nGM Creates New Post For Safety Issuess\n\nNorth Dakota Tries To Woo Workers To Fill Empty Jobs","2":"Read timely, trustworthy and engaging news involving B.C.'s multicultural communities on theprovince.com and theprovince.com\/asiapacific.\n\nQuestions or comments contact\n\nFabian Dawson at\n\nfdawson@theprovince.com","3":"Boeing (NYSE: BA ) is lower Wednesday amid conclusions by the Federal Aviation Administration that its 787 Dreamliner is fit to fly.The FAA initiated an investigation last year, after batteries in the 787 were determined to be unsafe for flight, grounding the entire fleet for three months.Improvements needed by Boeing were as follows:3.2.1. MANUFACTURING\/QUALITY BUSINESS MODELEarly on, suppliers experienced difficulty learning to work with the new business processes, especially in handling late engineering changes from Boeing. Boeing has increased supply chain support to mitigate supply chain issues, and supplier management has improved significantly. The CSRT recommends manufacturers ensure suppliers use a closed-loop system to capture realistic program risks and complementary mitigation plans.3.2.2. DESIGN REQUIREMENTSAlthough the CSRT did not find issues with the general methods used to develop design requirements, it noted the following issues with identified causes:\u2022 Communication of the requirements (flowdown),\u2022 Ownership of the requirements,\u2022 SMEs following the established design review process, and\u2022 Inadequate design requirements because of incorrect assumptions about how systems would perform based on previous experience with a similar design.The CSRT lessons learned for this area noted emphasis must be placed on requirements clarity and verification throughout the supply chain. In addition, the owner of the design requirement needs to be clear. The CSRT recommends that Boeing implement and advance its gated design and production processes and clarify supplier accountability.3.2.3. INSPECTION DELEGATIONThe CSRT found inspection delegation in widespread use among the suppliers. The CSRT noted many of Boeing\u2019s suppliers have unique inspection delegation processes, some of which do not meet minimum industry standards. The CSRT recommends that Boeing require all suppliers to follow industry standards for inspection delegation including certification and recertification.3.2.4. FAA REGULATORY OVERSIGHTThe CSRT observed that several FAA orders do not align with current practices. Specifically, the FAA orders do not\u2014\u2022 Encourage surveillance at critical subtier suppliers and require risk management models to allow assigning risk and surveillance requirements at integrator tier suppliers.\u2022 Recognize the differing levels of complexity of aircraft manufacturing systems and technologies (small, relatively simple aircraft manufacturers versus large-scale, complex aircraft manufacturers with extended supply chains.)\u2022 Describe a production approval process that focuses on aircraft complexity and critical technologies using a comprehensive risk-based plan.\u2022 Establish engineering conformity based on a risk-based conformity inspection plan.Recommendations were as follows:Based on the CSRT\u2019s observations of FAA oversight policy and guidance issues in chapter 2 of this report, the FAA CSRT team members recommend the following changes be made to FAA policy and guidance documents.\u2022 FAA Recommendation No. 1: The FAA should revise chapters 3 and 4 of FAA Order 8120.23, Certificate Management of Production Approval Holders, to recognize new aircraft manufacturing business models and their potential impact on safety, complexity, risk, and mitigating actions.\u2022 FAA Recommendation No. 2: The FAA should revise chapter 3 of FAA Order 8120.22, Production Approval Procedures, to recognize the changing aircraft manufacturing environment and to more fully address complex, large-scale aircraft manufacturers with extended supply chains, expectations, and production capabilities.\u2022 FAA Recommendation No. 3: The FAA should revise FAA Order 8110.4C, Type Certification, and FAA Order 8100.15B, Organization Designation Authorization Procedures, to provide clear and consistent guidance to ensure FAA engineering conformity inspections for all projects (including ODA projects) are based on risk. The orders should require FAA (or ODA) approval of the risk-based conformity plan.The full PDF is below:","4":"By Alan Levin Bloomberg News\n\nYou must sign in or register to continue reading content.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. regulators and Boeing didn\u2019t exercise enough quality control over subcontractors during the 787 Dreamliner\u2019s development, according to a review prompted by battery failures that led to the longest grounding of a commercial airplane since the 1950s.\n\nThe review found that the Dreamliner is safe, meets design standards and is about as reliable as other Boeing jetliners were after being introduced. The Federal Aviation Administration issued seven recommendations, four for Boeing and three for itself, to improve the way new-aircraft design and manufacturing is overseen.\n\n\u201cThe review team identified some problems with the manufacturing process and the way we oversee it, and we are moving quickly to address those problems,\u201d FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said in a statement.\n\nThe FAA\u2019s review of the 787\u2019s certification and manufacturing, announced in January 2013, is separate from an ongoing probe by the National Transportation Safety Board into what caused the battery incidents.\n\n\u201cWe welcomed the opportunity presented by this joint review,\u201d Ray Conner, Boeing commercial airplanes president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. \u201cThe findings validate our confidence in both the design of the airplane and the disciplined process used to identify and correct in-service issues as they arise.\u201d\n\nThe two cases in which 787 batteries overheated and emitted fumes in the U.S. and Japan were another blemish on a more-efficient plane that was beset with manufacturing delays and production issues. Those pushed its introduction more than three years behind schedule.\n\nThe 787 fell behind in part because Boeing turned over more authority to suppliers than during development of previous models. The arrangement, intended to cut costs and reduce Boeing risk, caused a series of delays starting in October 2007.\n\nThe first battery incident occurred Jan. 7, 2013, in Boston aboard a Japan Airlines plane that had arrived from Tokyo. It emitted fumes and gave off high heat, as if it was on fire, according to the NTSB.\n\nWhile no one was hurt and the plane didn\u2019t suffer significant damage, the NTSB opened an investigation because the aircraft was new and had just recently entered service.\n\nTwo days later, an All Nippon Airways 787 made an emergency landing at Takamatsu Airport in southern Japan after another lithium-ion battery overheated and fumes entered the cabin.\n\nBoth Japanese carriers halted flight of 787s, and the FAA followed on Jan. 17 with its order grounding the plane, the first such action in 34 years. At the time, there were 49 Dreamliners in service.\n\nOne hundreds days after the grounding, on April 19, the FAA announced it had approved a set of more-rigorous battery standards and allowed the plane to resume commercial operations.\n\nThe FAA directive required multiple additional protections for the battery system. Each of the individual eight cells was to be placed in a protective sleeve. The cells were enclosed in a steel case to prevent heat and fire from damaging a plane. A vent was devised so that any fumes would go outside the plane and not enter the cabin.\n\nGS Yuasa Corp., based in Kyoto, Japan, makes the batteries, which are part of an electrical system built by France\u2019s Thales. United Technologies Corp.\u2019s Aerospace Systems unit supplies the system, which uses 1.45 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 400 homes.\n\nIn its statement Wednesday, Boeing said it has instituted changes in the new-airplane development process, particularly with regard to outsourcing.\n\n\u201cThe review team outlined four recommended improvements for Boeing,\u201d the company said. \u201cThree of the recommendations focus on improving the flow of information, standards and expectations between the company and its suppliers. Boeing has already taken significant steps to implement these recommendations.\n\n\u201cThe fourth recommendation encourages Boeing to continue implementing and maturing the gated processes for development programs,\u201d Boeing said.\n\n\u201c\u2018Gated process\u2019 refers to the disciplined criteria followed as a new airplane model is developed. This ensures a sufficient level of maturity is gained before a program proceeds to key milestones such as design completion, production start and entry into service,\u201d the company said.\n\nMeanwhile, the review recommended that the FAA revise how it oversees new-airplane development programs \u201cto recognize new aircraft manufacturing business models\u201d and implement better production-approval procedures \u201cto more fully address complex, large-scale manufacturers with extended supply chains.\u201d\n\nBoeing had delivered 122 Dreamliners through last month, according to the company\u2019s website, most from the big factory in Everett but also from North Charleston, S.C. Airlines have ordered 1,031 Dreamliners in all.\n\nWhile the manufacturer boosted monthly production of the 787 to 10 from seven at the end of 2013, it has struggled to match deliveries with that schedule. The company had handed over only eight planes to airlines this year through February.\n\nBoeing is also contending with the potential for hairline cracks in wings on about 40 Dreamliners after supplier Mitsubishi Heavy Industries changed a manufacturing process, the company announced March 8. None of those 40 planes had been delivered to airlines.\n\nAfter the 2013 battery incidents and grounding, Boeing shares fell, from a close of $77.69 Jan. 4 to $73.65 Jan. 29, a 5.2 percent drop. As the investigation progressed and a fix was instituted, the shares climbed.\n\nShares have risen about 30 percent since the FAA announced it approved Boeing\u2019s fix for the 787, last April 19.\n\nDreamliners are the first commercial jets built chiefly of spun composite fibers instead of the traditional aluminum. The composite wing is distinctive for its 190-foot span and raked tips and, according to Boeing\u2019s website, is about 20 percent lighter because of the new materials.\n\nHerald staff contributed.","5":"Staying on the taper path, the Federal Open Market Committee today said it would trim its monthly purchases of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities from $65 billion to $55 billion. All three major U.S. stock indices were down on the committee's afternoon statement, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI)falling 44 points as of 3 p.m. EDT.\n\nThe Federal Reserve in recent months has moved away from its stance connecting the unemployment rate to its readiness to lift interest rates, and that trend continued today. While the unemployment rate has fallen faster than anticipated, it's mostly because of discouraged job hunters giving up the search. The Fed recognizes that issue and today announced that it would drop the unemployment rate as the primary measuring stick for the economy's strength. It will instead rely on a multitude of factors to decide when raising interest rates is the correct move. With that in mind, here are some large industrial companies making headlines today.\n\nInside the Dow, Boeing (NYSE:BA) had a couple of favorable headlines hit the news feed today. Boeing and Comair announced an order for eight 737 MAX 8s, the first such order from an African operator. The order was actually booked in December 2013 but was previously unidentified on the Boeing orders and deliveries website; it is valued at $830 million at list prices. This order will support future fleet expansion for the brands operated by Comair. There's also an option for the carrier to take another eight aircraft in the future.\n\nIn other positive news for the aviation juggernaut, the Federal Aviation Administration announced today that the Boeing 787 Dreamliner is safe after a thorough review of its lithium-ion battery issues.\n\n\"We concluded that the aircraft was soundly designed, and that Boeing and the FAA had processes in place that were designed to identify and correct any issue that might arise during the manufacturing process,\" FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said, according to USA Today. \"It's many layered. You don't have single points of failure.\"\n\nThis is welcome news for Boeing investors who have grown weary of the Dreamliner project running over budget due to production delays and other issues. As production of the 787 Dreamliner continues to accelerate, investors hope the project will become profitable for Boeing in 2016.\n\nOutside the Dow, investors of General Motors are hoping that its recent recalls of millions of vehicles globally doesn't turn into a nightmare akin to Toyota's (NYSE:TM) unintended acceleration problems. Toyota just agreed to pay a $1.2 billion fine, which is the largest penalty imposed on any automaker, according to federal prosecutors. Ultimately, the defect led to a recall of more than 10 million vehicles and the company's admission to concealing information and making false statements regarding safety issues.\n\n\"Other car companies should not repeat Toyota's mistake,\" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder warned in a statement, according to Automotive News. \"A recall may damage a company's reputation, but deceiving your customers makes that damage far more lasting.\"\n\nToyota will record the $1.2 billion in after-tax charges against earnings. While this is a huge penalty it won't put a dent in the automaker's cash pile of nearly $60 billion. That said, this drawn-out process could have larger ramifications for its brand inside the automotive industry, where Toyota long ago captured the image of reliability and safety. While General Motors is beginning its own battle with ignition issues linked to at least 12 deaths, Toyota's tarnished image could open up the door for Ford to continue increasing its market share and positive brand image in the U.S. market.","6":"cna.not.found.respheadline\n\nThe page you are looking for could not be found.\n\nYou may also like to try the following pages:\n\nAlternatively, you may like to do a search:","7":"Daniel Terdiman\/CNET\n\nDespite years of problems, including a series of on-board fires that led to a lengthy fleet-wide grounding, Boeing's 787 Dreamliner has been deemed safe by federal regulators.\n\nThis morning, Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration said that after a joint review process that began in January 2013, the \"787 meets the intended high level of safety expected by the FAA and Boeing.\"\n\nAmong other things, the review (PDF) examined the processes behind the design, certification, and production of the Dreamliner. \"The review's findings validate the integrity of the airplane's design and confirm the strength of the processes used to identify and correct issues that emerged before and after the airplane's certification.\"\n\nAlthough numerous airlines are currently flying the 787 Dreamliner, the next-generation airplane has been plagued by delays and problems throughout its history.

The review was initiated in January 2013, after a series of problems with the plane\u2019s electrical system and batteries surfaced and eventually caused the entire fleet of 787s to be grounded for three months.\n\nThe review team consisted of six FAA officials and seven Boeing employees, who spent six months validating the 787\u2019s certification process. The review committee\u2019s report stated:\n\nThe CSRT [critical systems review team] determined the B787 meets its intended level of safety based on (1) the fundamental soundness of the airplane\u2019s overall design and (2) the effective processes that have been defined and implemented to correct issues that arose during and after certification.\n\nThe review team made four recommendations:\n\nBoeing should establish a means to ensure suppliers identify program risks and complementary mitigation plans. Boeing should continue to implement and mature the gated design and production processes with sufficient resources for development programs, and to minimize risks throughout the life cycle of the program.

Since the FAA didn\u2019t have safety regulations for those batteries as installed equipment in planes when the 787 was designed, the agency and Boeing jointly developed the special safety conditions the plane\u2019s battery system should meet.\n\nAfter the battery failures, the FAA was criticized for relying too heavily on designated Boeing employees to ensure the safety of the plane\u2019s design and manufacture.\n\n\u201cThe (report\u2019s) findings validate our confidence in both the design of the airplane and the disciplined process used to identify and correct in-service issues as they arise,\u201d said Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Ray Conner.\n\nA National Transportation Safety Board investigation into the battery fire in Boston is still underway. Wednesday\u2019s report was not intended to address the battery\u2019s design, but rather the overall safety of Boeing\u2019s design and manufacture of the plane and the adequacy of FAA\u2019s oversight.\n\nThe report also makes several recommendations for improvement by Boeing and FAA. It says Boeing should ensure suppliers are fully aware of their responsibilities, establish a way to ensure suppliers identify realistic risks, and require suppliers to follow industry standards for personnel performing Boeing-required inspections.\n\nThe report recommended that the FAA make changes to its oversight of the safety certification of new planes to take into account \u201cnew aircraft manufacturing business models.\u201d\n\nBoeing extensively outsourced the manufacture of many elements of the 787 to overseas suppliers. Suppliers sometimes then outsourced portions of their work to other companies.\n\nAnother report recommendation is that the FAA revise its production approval procedures \u201cto more fully address complex, large-scale manufacturers with extended supply chains.\u201d\n\nLast month, an Air India Dreamliner, flying nonstop from Sydney to Delhi, with 215 people on board, landed in Kuala Lumpur under emergency conditions after its cockpit panels suffered a software malfunction. There was a third battery incident in Japan in January, but Boeing officials said the problem appeared to have been contained by the new battery design.\n\n___\n\nFollow Joan Lowy on Twitter at http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/AP_Joan_Lowy","17":"The Obamacare enrollment deadline is quickly approaching on March 31st, and numbers are picking up the pace as expected. However, with numbers sitting just above 5 million enrolled, will the number of Americans signing up reach the projected 7 million?\n\nThere are eleven days until the enrollment deadline, and the Department of Health and Human Services announced Monday that in the first half of March enrollment rose by about 800,000 people. That's about 0.4 million per week. At this point, enrollment would have to leap to 1 million per week, according to the Christian Science Monitor.\n\nThe Administration has really gone above and beyond to not only encourage people to sign up, but to also spread the word via social media. The president even went on Between Two Ferns in a ploy to get his message out there.\n\nThey are also riding the coattails of \"March Madness\" to make people aware of some reasons to get signed up, releasing their own \"bracket\". Seems desperate, but will it work?\n\nThere are still some issues that are slowing enrollment. There are still website kinks that seem to never end, there are coverage issues, and there is the fact that the costs (higher than promised) are not as affordable as just remaining uncovered and paying the penalty.\n\nThere was the problem last week during a WebMD interview wherein the President admitted that actually, you may not get to keep your doctor after all. And of course, there's the problem of some 51% of Americans in the new Bloomberg National Poll saying the mandate should be repealed.\n\nThe true test of success will be after the deadline passes, all are enrolled, and the dust settles. Will the Americans who received coverage through Obamacare like their new coverage? Will the promises made hold water?\n\nThat remains to be seen. As for the enrollment goal, 1 million per week seems steep, but stranger things have happened...\n\nImage Via YouTube","18":"THE PRESIDENT\u2019S PROMISE IS WORKING \u2026 IN REVERSE\n\nSurprise, surprise \u2026 except not really.\n\n\u201cObamacare\u201d \u2013 U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s socialized medicine monstrosity \u2013 is doing the exact opposite of what we were promised it would do.\n\nAgain \u2026\n\nAccording to a new report from Paul Bedard of The Washington Examiner, \u201cfamilies are paying an average of $663 a month and singles $274 a month, far more than before Obamacare kicked in.\u201d\n\nHow much more? According to data from eHealthInsurance.com, the family payments are up 56 percent from this time a year ago while individual payments are up by 39 percent from last February.\n\nWow \u2026 just \u2026 WOW.\n\nYet Obama and his allies continue to refer to this law as the \u201caffordable care\u201d act. Funny.\n\n\u201cIn an Obama administration, we\u2019ll lower premiums by up to $2,500 for a typical family per year,\u201d then-U.S. Senator Obama said during a June 2008 campaign swing through Virginia. \u201cWe won\u2019t do all this twenty years from now, or ten years from now.

At the end of Obama\u2019s first term, premiums for the average family with an employer-provided plan increased by $2,400 according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nNow they are skyrocketing even further \u2026\n\nViva la hope and change, people \u2026","19":"As we reach the end of the first year of enrollment in Obamacare\u2019s subsidized health insurance exchanges, we\u2019ve been trying to solve a couple of mysteries. First: how many people who have signed up for coverage were previously uninsured? Second: will the botched rollout and design flaws lead to even higher health insurance costs next year? We\u2019re starting to get indications from insurers that premiums on the exchanges will go up significantly in 2015. Here are four reasons why.\n\nConcerns about an Obamacare \u2018death spiral\u2019\n\nFor years, analysts have worried about the possibility that, for people who shop for coverage on their own, Obamacare could lead to an \u201cadverse selection death spiral.\u201d The law makes healthy people pay a lot more for their health insurance, in order to make coverage a better deal for the sick.\n\nIf the healthy people recognize this for what it is\u2014a bad deal for them\u2014they\u2019ll sit Obamacare out, making the law\u2019s health plans even less affordable than they were before. That\u2019s why, in theory, the law uses an individual mandate to force people to buy coverage that they don\u2019t need.\n\nI\u2019ve long been skeptical that a formal death spiral would occur; Obamacare\u2019s subsidies ensure that some healthy, but low-income, people will sign up for coverage. We have experience in places like New York and New Jersey, pre-Obamacare, with a two-tiered system in which subsidized coverage works okay for those who qualify.\n\nIt\u2019s the people who aren\u2019t eligible for large subsidies\u2014those who aren\u2019t poor enough\u2014who will gradually be squeezed out of affordable options.\n\nPremiums, on average, may increase by 20-40% in 2015\n\nAetna CEO Mark Bertolini was among the first to sound the alarm about the potential for rate shock on the Obamacare exchanges. In December 2012, he told investors that \u201cin some markets,\u201d individual-market premium increases \u201ccould go as high as 100 percent.\u201d This past January, in an interview with CNBC, he asked, \u201care we going to get beat up because [next year\u2019s premium increases will be] double-digit or are we just going to have to pull out of the program?\u201d\n\nYesterday, Elise Viebeck of The Hill cited unnamed health industry officials as telling her that \u201cObamacare-related premiums will double in some parts of the country, countering claims made by the administration.\u201d One insurer indicated that \u201chis company expects to triple its rates next year on the Obamacare exchange.\u201d I\u2019ve been hearing that insurers expect to see rate increases of about 20 to 40 percent, on average, throughout the country. Here are four reasons why.\n\n1. The White House is making up the rules as it goes along\n\nInsurers are particularly upset about the White House\u2019s extralegal improvisations, in which key Obamacare regulations have been delayed, suspended, or exempted in various circumstances. In particular, the administration\u2019s decision to continue to allow people to keep their \u201cgrandfathered\u201d pre-Obamacare plans, in some limited instances, will keep a lot of those healthy people out of the Obamacare exchanges.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re exasperated,\u201d an insurance executive told Viebeck. \u201cAll of these major delays on very significant portions of the law are going to change what it\u2019s going to cost.\u201d\n\nThink about it this way. According to the Associated Press, 4.7 million Americans who shop for coverage on their own have been notified that their old plans will be canceled. Let\u2019s say about half of these people\u20142.5 million\u2014elect to preserve their old arrangements under the new Obama dispensation. Let\u2019s further estimate that about 4 million people have enrolled in Obamacare exchange plans, of which about three-fourths were previously insured.\n\nThat\u2019s three million previously insured people enrolling in Obamacare, versus 2.5 million finding coverage elsewhere: more than enough to substantially skew the risk pool in the exchange toward sicker and older people.\n\n2. The administration has avoided talking about the individual mandate\n\nA few weeks back, the Obama administration suspended the individual mandate for those whose plans had been previously canceled, declaring this feature of Obamacare to be a \u201chardship\u201d worthy of exemption. The best part is that in order to apply for the exemption, you simply have to \u201cattest\u201d that your old plan was canceled. My colleague Scott Gottlieb has tabulated 14 different ways you can avoid complying with the mandate.\n\nThe administration hasn\u2019t created a mechanism with which to verify that this has actually happened to you. As a result, lots of people will be able to opt out of the individual mandate.\n\nArguably worse is the fact that the White House has deliberately avoided talking about the individual mandate in its outreach to the uninsured. My sources indicate that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and affiliated outside groups like Organizing for Action, tested a number of different messages on young people that might encourage them to sign up for coverage. The ones that tested most poorly were those that mentioned that young people would pay a steep fine if they refused to buy into Obamacare.\n\nThat\u2019s why, in all of the gauzy ads you see promoting Obamacare to young people, two things are never mentioned: (1) the steep prices of the plans; (2) the individual mandate. In February, Sharon Long and Dana Goin of the Urban Institute published a survey indicating that less than two-fifths of the uninsured had heard \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d about the individual mandate.\n\nIf the individual mandate falls down in a forest, and nobody hears it, does it really exist?\n\n3. Many of the young people enrolling are pregnant women\n\nWe\u2019ve been talking a lot about the proportion of young people signing up for Obamacare versus old people. Around 30 percent of the signer-uppers are under the age of 35. That\u2019s not great\u2014but it\u2019s not catastrophically bad in and of itself. What\u2019s hidden in that figure, however, is that a lot of the younger people signing up under Obamacare are also consuming a lot of health care.\n\nOne of the biggest changes that Obamacare makes to the private health insurance market is that it forces all insurers to cover a wide range of health care services that the government has deemed \u201cessential.\u201d One of those newly mandated health benefits is maternity coverage.\n\nIf you\u2019re expecting, you have a huge incentive to sign up for Obamacare-based insurance. According to a survey by Truven Health Analytics, in 2007 the average insurer paid $18,329 for a vaginal birth and $27,866 for a cesarean birth, inclusive of maternal and newborn charges. But for a typical 27-year-old, Obamacare-based insurance might cost around $200 per month.\n\nThough I don\u2019t have any hard numbers, the indications I\u2019m getting from insurers is that they\u2019re seeing a disproportionate number of pregnant enrollees among younger people. In addition, NerdWallet calculates that the average cost of \"recommended annual preventive services and...oral contraceptives for an uninsured woman\" is $1,231, making Obamacare much less expensive, on net, for those who seek these services. Insurers are going to take that into account when they price their premiums for 2015.\n\n4. Obamacare\u2019s design gave insurers an incentive to \u2018underprice\u2019 in 2014\n\nOne last point. The various mechanisms that Obamacare\u2019s exchanges use to keep insurers on board\u2014what industry wonks call the \u201cthree Rs\u201d of risk adjustment, reinsurance, and risk corridors\u2014have been exploited by some insurers to offer prices that, while still high, are relatively lower than their competitors. Obamacare incentivizes insurers to do this, because they know that in the early years of the exchanges, they\u2019ll be reimbursed by taxpayers for doing so.\n\nThis is why Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.), among others, has been sounding the alarm about a taxpayer-funded \u201cbailout\u201d of Obamacare-participating insurers. But as time goes on, the incentive that insurers have to use these tactics recedes. In 2015, many insurers who tried to underprice their premiums relative to their costs are planning to bring rates more in line with what they\u2019re actually spending on health claims. That\u2019s going to drive prices upward.\n\nPricing data will come out this summer\n\nInsurers will have to file their proposed rates for 2015 in the late spring of 2014. So we should know by summer how this all shakes out. Don\u2019t be surprised if Congress\u2019 August recess is filled with another set of town hall meetings in which angry constituents ask politicians about their latest round of premium hikes. For those who already struggle to afford their health insurance bills, the worst is not yet over.\n\n* * *\n\nUPDATE: Echoing Mark Bertolini's comments, WellPoint executive Ken Goulet told investors on Friday that \"Looking at the rate increases on a year-over-year basis on our exchanges, and it will vary by carrier, but all of them will probably be in double digit plus.\"\n\nREAD AVIK\u2019S NEW BOOK, How Medicaid Fails the Poor (Encounter, 2013), available at Amazon and other major retailers.

The president plugged healthcare.gov, the website where Americans can shop for and buy new insurance plans, saying it works well now after its troubled launch in the fall and that young Americans should know they can buy a plan for the same cost as their cell phone bill.\n\nThe stunt appears to have paid off for Obama. The video has been viewed more than 19 million times on Funny or Die\u2019s website alone, administration officials said traffic to healthcare.gov jumped 40 per cent in the hours after it was posted online and Funny or Die was the number one referral site.\n\nWhite House spokesman Jay Carney said it was a \u201ccreative\u201d way to reach Americans and that it will be \u201cone of the reasons we get young Americans to enrol in health insurance programs.\u201d\n\nThe White House certainly is stretching its creative muscles to get adults aged 18 to 34 to buy insurance before the open enrolment period ends. After March 31, Americans without insurance are subject to a fine.\n\nYoung adults are one of the largest groups of uninsured in the U.S. and to help change that, the Affordable Care Act allows youth to stay on their parents\u2019 plan until age 26. But getting those without access to a plan to pay into one is also crucial, some warn, in order to cover the higher costs of health care for older people and to keep premiums stable.\n\nA twist on March Madness\n\nLast week was Funny or Die, and this week\u2019s strategy from the White House is using the hype around the NCAA\u2019s annual March Madness college basketball tournament. It created its own online \u201cbracketology\u201d game where players choose their favourites from 16 reasons for signing up for insurance.\n\nEach reason \u2013 like \u201cbirth control is free\u201d and \u201cit will give your mom peace of mind\u201d \u2013 is accompanied by a GIF (a looping animated video or graphic), most of them of cats, \u201cbecause the internet loves GIFs of cute animals,\u201d the White House blog explains.\n\nThe White House recruited NBA star Shane Battier and NCAA officials for a call with reporters Tuesday and the department of health and human services was circulating statistics about the cost of a broken arm or ankle without insurance and how many sports injuries are suffered by young people.\n\nA few weeks ago, Obama hosted popular young YouTube personalities for a chat at the White House about how to spread the word among their peers. They've been touting Obamacare to their followers through livechats, music videos, Twitter and other methods.\n\nAnother online campaign with the Twitter hashtag #YourMomCares features the mothers of celebrities Jonah Hill, Alicia Keys, Jennifer Lopez and Adam Levine. \u201cSeriously, do you want your mothers to have a nervous breakdown? You need health insurance.\u201d \u201cDo it for your mom,\u201d they implore in the video, along with first lady Michelle Obama who says, \u201cWe nag you because we love you.\u201d\n\nSharon Feldstein, left, and Patsy Noah, mothers of Hollywood stars Jonah Hill and Adam Levine respectively, appear in a YouTube video encouraging young people to buy a health insurance plan. (YouTube)\n\nSo will all this nagging from the White House and pro-Obamacare advocates who are doing their own work across the U.S. to get young people to sign up actually work?\n\n\u201cI think that they\u2019ve done a lot of really great things,\u201d according to Erin Hemlin, a manager at a Washington-based non-profit called Young Invincibles. \u201cThings like that are really helping.\u201d Her organization formed in 2009 to represent youth in the Affordable Care Act debate.\n\nHemlin said enrolment by youth was slow in October when the online marketplaces first launched but it\u2019s been picking up in recent weeks. Not unlike cramming for an exam, she expects young Americans to sign up with little time to spare before March 31.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s going to be a lot of people who sign up in the last week or so \u2026 young people procrastinate,\u201d she said.\n\nThe most recent government numbers show that 5 million Americans have bought a plan since October. About 25 per cent are between 18 and 34 years old. That\u2019s not as high as the administration would like but they are counting on the final days to bump up the numbers.\n\nYouth expected to procrastinate\n\n\u201cWe always expected that this month, March, would be the time that we\u2019d really see young people come out because it\u2019s right before the deadline, and that\u2019s just the nature of being young is that sometimes you wait until things are due to get them done,\u201d said Jessica Barba Brown, communications director at Enroll America, a non-profit dedicated to signing people up for new health insurance.\n\nIts March blitz campaign involves a bus tour, that included a stop at the SXSW music festival in Austin, Texas, and 3,000 events, dozens of them on college campuses. But Enroll America also dedicated $7 million to reaching Americans online and its digital advertising has an \u201caggressive\u201d focus on young people, Brown said.\n\nObama\u2019s amusing appearance on Between Two Ferns was effective in getting people\u2019s attention and now there has to be follow through so that people actually sign up in the remaining days, she said.\n\nBut not everyone is laughing. The White House\u2019s youth outreach is rubbing one group, Generation Opportunity, the wrong way. It describes itself as a free-thinking, liberty-loving organization of young people.\n\nIt countered the March Madness theme with its own \u201c16 reasons to opt out of Obamacare\u201d list on its website. \u201cThousands of Canadians came to America for their health care to avoid their government-run health-care system,\u201d is among them.\n\nEvan Feinberg, president of the group, told Fox News on Tuesday he takes issue with Obamacare itself and the way it\u2019s been pitched to young adults.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve really talked down to us and suggested that we\u2019re stupid and that the reasons we\u2019re signing up for Obamacare are because it\u2019s cool or because LeBron James or Amy Poehler or some other celebrity supports it,\u201d he said.\n\nLike it or not, the deadline to sign up is fast approaching and if it\u2019s missed, the next chance to get insurance isn\u2019t until November 2014.","21":"HHS Has Authority To Grant Exceptions to Open Enrollment\n\nHHS can extend the general open enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act's insurance exchanges beyond March 31, despite statements from department officials that they cannot or do not have plans to do so, Modern Healthcare's \"Vital Signs\" reports.\n\nDuring a media conference call last week, HHS Office of Health Reform Director Michael Hash said, \"We do not believe we have the authority to extend that period beyond March 31,\" adding, \"We have no plans to do so.\" HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius echoed Hash's comments during a House committee hearing last week, saying that the Obama administration will not extend the enrollment period.\n\nHowever, Sebelius during the hearing said that her department could grant special enrollment periods, or SEPs, for consumers who are still unable to complete their enrollment applications through HealthCare.gov because of lingering technological problems, according to \"Vital Signs.\"\n\nShe said HHS has \"made it clear that if, through no fault of their own, [consumers] were unable to enroll, that eligibility extends to a delayed enrollment period and they will have a special enrollment period which we have the authority to grant.\"\n\n\"Vital Signs\" notes that HHS had granted a special enrollment period in December 2013 so that consumers, who struggled to complete their applications because of HealthCare.gov's glitches, could still qualify for coverage that took effect on Jan. 1 (Demko, \"Vital Signs,\" Modern Healthcare, 3\/18).\n\nObama Admin Targets 10 States With Highest Uninsured Rates\n\nMeanwhile, the administration and ACA supporters are stepping up their exchange enrollment outreach efforts in 10 states that could determine whether it achieves a projected goal of enrolling six million people by March 31, Kaiser Health News reports. The uninsured in those states -- seven of which are governed by Republicans -- account for almost two-thirds of the nation's 47 million uninsured residents (Galewitz, Kaiser Health News, 3\/19).\n\nOn Monday, CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner announced that as of Sunday at least five million people had enrolled in health plans through the Affordable Care Act's federal and state-operated insurance exchanges (California Healthline, 3\/18).\n\nAccording to KHN, \"hundreds\" of enrollment events have been planned during the next several days in the 10 states, which are:\n\nCalifornia;\n\nFlorida;\n\nGeorgia;\n\nIllinois;\n\nNew Jersey;\n\nNew York;\n\nNorth Carolina;\n\nOhio;\n\nPennsylvania; and\n\nTexas.\n\nOnly two of those states -- California and New York -- are operating their own exchanges. State-run exchanges generally are faring better in terms of enrollment because of the additional funding they received under the ACA, KHN reports (Kaiser Health News, 3\/19).","22":"What would you get if you combined your income tax filing with the health history form you fill out at your doctor\u2019s office?\n\nAn application for Obamacare.\n\nWhile improvements in the federal website have made the enrollment process smoother, it could never be called \u201ceasy.\u201d That\u2019s because it asks for lots of personal and financial data at the same time it requires decisions about health care.\n\nIs it more important to save money or have access to the doctor you\u2019ve been seeing for years? Would you rather pay more in monthly premiums for a policy that had lower co-pays, or have lower premiums and higher co-pays? And looking into that crystal ball you brought along just in case, how much do you think you\u2019ll make this year?\n\nWith just 12 days left to buy private health insurance through the federal website, the easiest way to get through the process may be to have someone guide you through the journey.\n\nThose people have a name \u2014 \u201cnavigators\u201d \u2014 and they\u2019re scattered around the state, ready to help.\n\nOne way to find them is to click the \u201cFind Local Help\u201d button on HealthCare.gov. By typing in your ZIP code, you can see what groups and institutions have federal grants to provide help.\n\nAnother route would be to call your local hospital. Many are offering enrollment guidance themselves, or know where to find such help nearby. Check njha.com\/reform to see a list of sign-up sessions scheduled between now and March 31, the deadline to purchase private insurance through the federal exchange.\n\nThere are two enrollment offices in the northern part of the state that work directly with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. If you have a complicated set of circumstances, it may be worth the ride to consult them. The Edison enrollment assistance center is at 1719 State Route 27, Festival Plaza, (732-484-9710). The Wayne center is at 1211 Hamburg Turnpike, Suite 301, (201-414-0465).\n\nBoth centers are open seven days a week.\n\nAnother option is to consult a local insurance broker who handles health insurance. While agents typically handle small business accounts, they can handle individuals as well, said David Oscar, a spokesman for the New Jersey Association of Health Underwriters. Their help is free to clients; agents ultimately get paid by the insurance carrier for sending business its way.\n\nYou can locate a nearby agent at njahu.org.\n\nEven with the help of a trained professional, the experts say to plan on spending at least 90 minutes on the process \u2014 longer if you\u2019re enrolling on behalf of a large family.\n\nThe most difficult part may be \u201creading the questions thoroughly and not reading them too fast,\u201d said Oscar. Some of the questions are silly, he said, such as the one asking about the pregnancy status of all females in the household, including infants.\n\nThat\u2019s why it helps to gather all the information you need before you apply, whether that application is by phone (800-318-2596), computer (HealthCare.gov), or face-to-face:\n\n\u2022 Not just your Social Security number, but the numbers of everyone you\u2019re signing up for, including small children. (You don\u2019t need proof of your Social Security number; you just need to know what it is.)\n\n\u2022 If you are a permanent resident, bring your green card.\n\n\u2022 If you are switching from a policy you have but don\u2019t like, bring that policy number and company name.\n\n\u2022 Something that helps document your income, whether it\u2019s your taxes for last year, or better yet, recent pay stubs. You will be required to state your best guess for what you\u2019ll earn in 2014, and the more accurate your prediction, the better, say tax advisers.","23":"Daily Events Top\n\nWhen liberal pro-Obama scholars question the legality of President Barack Obama\u2019s actions to implement Obamacare, the issue of illegal presidential use of power moves from partisan to frightening.\n\nGeorge Washington Law School\u2019s Jonathan Turley is the second most quoted law professor in the nation and a two-time Obama voter. He recently testified before Congress on Obama\u2019s extensive use of executive orders and administrative actions to make unilateral changes in Obamacare, immigration policy, minimum wage and the IRS qualifying standards for non-profit status.\n\nAs to Obamacare, Obama, so far, changed it in at least a dozen major ways, including, but not limited to, postponing the employer mandate, allowing insurance carriers to let their insured keep an old policy, and, more recently, redefining the Obamacare \u201chardship\u201d exemption so broadly as to nullify the individual mandate for at least two more years.\n\nWas this legal?\n\nTurley said: \u201cPresident Obama has repeatedly violated this (separation of powers) doctrine in the circumvention of Congress in areas ranging from health care to immigration law to environmental law. We are in the midst of a constitutional crisis with sweeping implications for our system of government. \u2026 \u201d We are now at the constitutional tipping point for our system.\u201d\n\nTurley challenged Congress to re-assert its authority. \u201cIf balance is to be reestablished,\u201d he said, \u201cit must begin before this President leaves office, and that will likely require every possible means to reassert legislative authority. No one in our system can \u2018go it alone\u2019 \u2014 not Congress, not the courts, and not the President.\u201d\n\nObama sold Obamacare with many now-broken promises. Saving costs was a big one. In 2009, the Congressional Budget Office set the net cost of Obamacare at $599 billion over 10 years \u2014 citing a gross cost of $848 billion less $249 billion in tax revenues and other cost savings. But recently the CBO revised the 10-year price tag to more than $2 trillion.\n\nEconomist Jonathan Gruber, the father of Romneycare \u2014 which was the template for Obamacare \u2014 recently admitted that well, no, costs will not be going down. \u201cCovering people with health insurance doesn\u2019t save money,\u201d said Gruber. \u201cThat was sometimes a misleading motivator for the Affordable Care Act. The law isn\u2019t designed to save money. It\u2019s designed to improve health, and that\u2019s going to cost money.\u201d\n\nSo, Obamacare won\u2019t save money, but at least those too poor to afford health insurance will now lead healthier lives, right? Not necessarily.\n\nOregon expanded its Medicaid program years ago \u2014 the way Obamacare does now \u2014 to include some of Oregon\u2019s low-income uninsured. Because of costs, Oregon did this on a random lottery basis. Some got it, some, unfortunately, wanted to but couldn\u2019t. But this allows comparisons. Oregon, for example, can now compare the health outcomes of the now-insured Oregonians against those who wanted to get insurance, but couldn\u2019t. Surely, the now-insured are healthier compared to those without health insurance.\n\nBut there were no significant differences in their health care outcomes. While the newly insured did increase their doctor visits for preventative and primary-care services, some could not get appointments with doctors, many of whom wouldn\u2019t take new Medicaid patients. Emergency room use went up 40 percent among the new Medicaid patients, not down \u2014 all for non-emergency medical needs. Forbes health care researcher Avik Roy writes, \u201cThe result calls into question the $450 billion a year we spend on Medicaid, and the fact that Obamacare throws 11 million more Americans into this broken program.\u201d\n\nWorse, the uninsured dislike Obamacare even more than do those with health insurance. A recent Kaiser Health poll found that among the uninsured, only 22 percent have a favorable attitude toward Obamacare, a far-lower percentage than the 56 percent of uninsured who are unfavorable toward Obamacare.\n\nBefore Obama became president, he said if he were \u201cstarting from scratch,\u201d he\u2019d go with a single-payer system. A few months ago, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid was asked whether Obamacare would lead us to single-payer. Reid said, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d This is the real plan.\n\nSingle-payer is universal healthcare system used in Canada. It remains popular. But in 2009, the incoming president of the Canadian Medical Association said: \u201c(Canadian doctors) all agree that the system is imploding. We all agree that things are more precarious than perhaps Canadians realize.\u201d What did the outgoing CMA president propose? He said: \u201cA health care revolution has passed us by\u201d and \u201ccompetition should be welcomed, not feared.\u201d So while the Canadian Medical Association urges more competition and privatization, America moves toward even more government involvement in health care.\n\nIn the annual index of countries rated on \u201ceconomic freedom,\u201d the United States \u2014 since 2008 \u2014 has slipped from the No. 5 position to No. 12. Canada \u2014 at No. 6 \u2014 is now more \u201ceconomically free\u201d than the United States! Economic freedom and prosperity go hand in hand.\n\nYet this administration makes it clear it is more interested in wealth re-distribution and less interested in wealth creation. President Obama is quite adept at the former \u2014 clueless about how to achieve the latter.\n\nLarry Elder is a best-selling author and radio talk-show host.","24":"This site has been blocked by the network administrator.","25":"Targeted News Service\n\nWASHINGTON , March 19 -- The White House issued the text of the following news briefing by Press Secretary Jay Carney :\n\nMR. CARNEY : Good early afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for being here. Before I take your questions, I'd like to mention something.\n\nAs many of you are well aware, with over 5 million people now signed up for private health insurance plans through the marketplaces, and 13 days left to enroll this week, we are doing a March Madness enrollment push to reach our fellow college basketball fans, especially young adults, before the March 31st deadline.\n\nYesterday, we released our \"16 Sweetest Reasons to Get Covered\" bracket, and a video by the UNC and UCONN coaches. Today, we're lucky to have NCAA and NBA champion Shane Battier joining us to release a new analysis by HHS that looks at the economic costs and the incidence of common sports injuries like sprains and fractures. The report finds that almost 2 million people every year suffer sports-related injuries and receive treatments in emergency departments. And if you don't have insurance, these types of injuries can really set you back financially. For example, treatment for a sprained ankle could cost over $2,000 . Treatment for a broken arm could run you as much as nearly $7,700 . This data also finds that the rate of these types of injuries is especially high among folks under 25.\n\nSo this is yet another reminder of the importance of getting covered, whether you're an athlete, a fan, or, like so many of you here, both.\n\nWith that, I will take your questions.\n\nQ (Laughter.) Take that as a compliment.\n\nMR. CARNEY : That's exactly right.\n\nQ Jay, on Ukraine -- Putin annexed Crimea today. What is the definition of success if this is being labeled a test of President Obama 's leadership, as Tom Donilon mentioned over the weekend? What is failure? What is success? Before, you were trying to stop something from happening; it seems that now you have to undo something. That's a much tougher task. And what's the goal for the meeting of the G7 in The Hague next week?\n\nMR. CARNEY : Let me say a few things. We condemn Russia's moves to formally annex the Crimean region of Ukraine . Such action is a threat to international peace and security, and it is against international law. We would not recognize this attempted annexation.\n\nAs we have said, there are costs for such action. Along with our partners in Europe and Japan , the United States imposed sanctions yesterday, including an executive order that gives us an expansive tool to sanction Russian government officials, entities operating in the arms sector in Russia , and individuals who act on behalf of or provide material support to senior officials of the Russian government. You have seen some designations already, and there are more to come.\n\nWe also continue to be focused on how we can best support Ukraine . We urge Congress to pass legislation as soon as possible that will enable us to provide Ukraine the resources it needs. We also support the IMF's ongoing work to negotiate a package with the Ukrainians.\n\nIn addition, as you know, Vice President Biden was in Poland today, and he will be in Lithuania tomorrow. To our NATO allies, our message is clear: We have a solemn commitment to our collective defense, and we will uphold this commitment.\n\nLastly, I would note that today, President Obama invited his counterparts from Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , the United Kingdom and the EU to a meeting of G7 leaders next week on the margins of the Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague . In answer to your question, the meeting will focus on the situation in Ukraine and further steps that the G7 may take to respond to developments and to support Ukraine . As you know, the U.S. and the other members of the G7 have already suspended our preparations for the G8 Summit in Sochi.\n\nThe actions that Russia has taken, in clear violation of international law, in clear disregard for Ukraine's constitution, Ukraine's territorial integrity and Ukraine's sovereignty, have not been and will not be recognized by the international community. Those actions have incurred costs already. They have done damage to Russia's economy, to its currency, and to its standing in the world. Further actions, further provocations will lead to higher costs.\n\nThe goal of our policy is to make clear that in the 21st century, in the year 2014, these kinds of actions are not tolerated by the international community; that they are responded to, they bring about consequences. And the leaders of Russia will have to make their own calculations about the costs that they are incurring for their country and for Russia's future and Russia's standing in the world.\n\nIn the meantime, the President is focused on working to build and sustain the consensus that exists in opposition to these actions, and to ensure that we collectively, both here in the United States and in Europe and Asia , are working to support Ukraine and to make it clear that these kinds of actions will not be accepted by the international community.\n\nQ So the goal of the policy is for the Russians to disavow any steps that they have taken for the Crimean Peninsula to become -- to be part of Ukraine ? Or is it more to just get the Russians to stop threatening the Eastern Ukrainian region?\n\nMR. CARNEY : The answer is both, in the sense that what Russia has done -- the referendum held under circumstances that are unacceptable under international law and in violation of Ukraine's constitution, the military actions taken by Russia , the actions taken by the Crimean parliament and the Russian Duma are not and will not be recognized by the international community. Further provocations will result in increased costs to Russia and others who engage in activities that violate a sovereign state's territorial integrity.\n\nQ So you've gone after visas, asset forfeitures. None of that has changed Putin's mind. Why not deploy the full arsenal of your economic power against them initially, instead of doing it piecemeal, which doesn't seem to be doing anything with the Russians?\n\nMR. CARNEY : Jim, what I would say is that the motivations and the calculations of the leaders in Russia are for them to describe. What we have done is made clear that these actions will never be recognized by the international community. They're illegal, and they violate a sovereign state's territorial integrity.\n\nWe will make clear that we support the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people. And we will make sure that there are costs to Russia for the actions that Russia has taken. And the assessments as to what costs Russia's leaders are willing to pay on behalf of their nation and at the expense of the Russian people are ones that they will have to make. But they are real.\n\nAnd Russia is taking action that reverses some of the work that that nation had done to establish itself as a responsible leader on the international stage. It isolates Russia . It undermines faith in Russia's commitment to rule of law, and therefore undermines the incentive that global investors might have in investing in Russia . That effect has a negative impact on Russia's economy and on the Russian people. And those costs are real.\n\nWhat we can do is make sure that the costs are imposed, that the international community speaks with one voice in opposition to these steps, and that we together take action to ensure that the costs are imposed as we take action to ensure that Ukraine is supported with assistance by the United States and our allies and partners and the IMF, and as we take steps to make it clear, as Vice President Biden has done in Poland and will do in Lithuania , that we consider our commitment to our NATO allies a solemn commitment that, of course, will be upheld.\n\nQ And on another subject -- The Washington Post is now reporting that the NSA has the ability to not only collect metadata about phone calls made and numbers, but that the calls themselves are recorded and can be played back. These are calls from foreign countries. Can you comment on that?\n\nMR. CARNEY : I can't. I haven't seen the report, and I don't have a response to it except to say that we don't, as a general rule, comment on every specific allegation or report. We made clear what activity the NSA and our intelligence community engages in, and the fact that they are bound by our laws and the oversight of three branches of government. We also note, as I did the other day, the steps that the President announced in January to significantly reform our activity in order to provide the American people even greater assurance about these programs. But I don't have anything specific on that report.\n\nQ Jay, would the U.S. back the expulsion of Russia from the G8? Do you expect this to come up at the meeting next week?\n\nMR. CARNEY : We and the other G7 nations have already now announced that preparations for the planned G8 Summit in Sochi have been halted. I don't have a preview of all the topics that will be discussed in the G7 meeting in The Hague , on the fringes of the National Security Summit -- sorry, the Nuclear Security Summit. But certainly Ukraine and Russia's behavior will be the number-one focus of that conversation.\n\nIt is hard to imagine a meeting of this group taking place in Russia under the current circumstances.\n\nQ And Vladimir Putin said today that he's not interested in Ukraine beyond Crimea. Has he given the President such assurances, and do you believe him?\n\nMR. CARNEY : The President, as you know, spoke with President Putin the other day, one of several conversations, lengthy conversations the two leaders have had. We provided a readout; I don't have any more specificity on that conversation.\n\nWhat we are monitoring is activity, of course, in Eastern Ukraine and near Eastern Ukraine , and we are making clear that further provocations will be met with further costs to Russia . We are making clear our support for the Ukrainian government. We are working with Congress to ensure that bilateral assistance is provided and that the IMF has all the tools it needs to provide even greater assistance to Ukraine . And we're in conversations with the Ukrainian government and others about other modes of assistance that we can provide.\n\nI'm not going to judge the truthfulness of the statements. We're going to look and see and evaluate the actions that are taken.\n\nLet me go up and back. Steve.\n\nQ The Russian stock market is soaring the last couple days. Is this a sign that the sanctions that we've taken are ineffective if they're not really paying a cost? In reality, it's up about 8, 9 percent in the last couple days, their main stock exchange.\n\nMR. CARNEY : I think it's down for the year and I think the ruble has lost value. And I think that the long-term effect of actions taken by the Russian government, in clear violation of the United Nations charter, in clear violation of its treaty commitments that are destabilizing and illegal, will have an impact on their economy all by themselves. They will also incur costs because of the sanctions that we and the EU have imposed, and there will be more actions taken under the authorities that exist with the two executive orders that the President has signed. So I wouldn't, if I were you, invest in Russian equities right now -- unless you're going short.\n\nQ How important is it for Congress to act, given this last few days? And is the administration considering additional steps that you would like to see Congress take when they return in the light of the fact that the annexation is now going forward?\n\nMR. CARNEY : Additional steps that Congress can take or should take? What Congress needs to do, as soon as it is able, is pass the assistance package that has been moving through the Senate . And we strongly encourage both houses to pass legislation that not only provides the bilateral assistance but ensures that the IMF has all the tools necessary to provide the maximum amount of assistance to Ukraine -- because our bilateral assistance, everyone agrees, is meant to complement, not replace, the IMF's assistance. And if we all care, as we say we do, about making sure that the Ukrainian government in this difficult moment has all the assistance it needs to stabilize its economy, Congress needs to make sure that those IMF quota reforms are passed, as well as the bilateral assistance.\n\nWhat other steps Congress can take, I'm sure we will be in discussion with congressional leaders about that matter. We are in regular consultation with the Ukrainian government, with our allies in Europe and others about what the Ukrainian government's needs are and how we can assist them. Right now, our focus is and continues to be on de-escalation and on doing what we can to help Ukraine stabilize their economy in this difficult moment.\n\nJim.\n\nQ After that performance in Moscow today, does the President believe that Putin would actually give Crimea back?\n\nMR. CARNEY : We're not judging motives or intentions or predicting future actions, Jim. I think President Putin spoke for himself today, and everyone can evaluate what he said.\n\nWhat is unquestionably true is that the actions that have occurred in Crimea, the decisions made by the Russian government are all in violation of international law and the Ukrainian constitution.\n\nWe have said all along, and so has the Ukrainian government, that there are legal means by which the residents of Crimea could take steps to change their status within Ukraine or change their relationship with Ukraine or Russia , for that matter. But there's a legal code in place and a constitution in place for those kinds of discussions to take place and decisions to be made.\n\nQ But it appears that Putin is not adhering to that legal code.\n\nMR. CARNEY : No question.\n\nQ So how do you deal with a person like that? How do you deal with the Russians if they're not abiding by the same legal code?\n\nMR. CARNEY : We are imposing costs to Russia through sanctions and other measures. The international community is doing the same, and there are other costs incurred by Russia because of these actions that have an effect on Russia's ability to grow and prosper in the future. So what the motives of the Russian leadership are, I have to point you to statements by Russian leaders.\n\nQ And is there a sense of urgency that the West needs to step it up quickly in order to have Putin and Russia reverse course? Is there a sense of urgency?\n\nMR. CARNEY : This is certainly a serious situation and we have taken steps accordingly, and we will continue to do so as I indicated earlier. There are more designations to come when it comes to specific sanctions under the authorities created by the executive orders. And I noted that the executive order the President signed yesterday is an expansive tool that allows for sanctions to be imposed on Russian government officials -- that has happened -- but also on entities operating in the arms sector in Russia and on individuals who act on behalf of or provide material support to Russian government officials even though they themselves do not hold office in the government.\n\nAnd I think that we discussed that yesterday -- there are individuals who fall into that category who have both a great deal of influence in Russia and on the Russian government and who also have substantial assets that can and would be affected by these kinds of sanctions.\n\nQ And you've heard the critics in the last couple of days say that because the President showed weakness to Russia , that that invited this move from Putin to take Crimea. What is your best argument that that is not the case?\n\nMR. CARNEY : Here's what I would say in response to those criticisms, which always lack an alternative approach or proposal. The idea that bombing another country -- in this case, Syria -- would have somehow been the right policy in order to send a message to the leader of Russia so that he didn't take action against Ukraine is preposterous in many ways. It is also provably wrong, as others have said. The fact that President George W. Bush invaded Iraq and had two ongoing wars in the Middle East didn't seem to affect Russia's calculations when it came to its actions in Georgia . So there's a problem with the logic.\n\nI would generally say that when assessments are made and judgments made about the course of action the United States is taking with regard to Ukraine , most of what we here called for, we are doing and we will continue to do, including stepping up our assistance to Ukraine , including ratcheting up the costs to Russia for their actions. If there are other concrete ideas that lawmakers or others have, they ought to express them; and certainly if they're good ideas, we may take them up.\n\nChuck. I never get to my right here.\n\nQ What made today so special about suspending diplomatic relations with Syria ?\n\nMR. CARNEY : I'm not sure it's about -- what's special about today --\n\nQ I guess, why didn't it happen sooner?\n\nMR. CARNEY : Following the announcement that the Syrian embassy suspended its provision of consular services, and in consideration of the atrocities the Assad regime has committed against the Syrian people, we have determined it is unacceptable for individuals appointed by that regime to conduct diplomatic or consular operations here in the United States . Consequently, the United States notified the Syrian government today that it must immediately suspend operations of its embassy in Washington, D.C. and its honorary consulates in Troy, Michigan and Houston, Texas . Syrian diplomats at the embassy and Syrian honorary consulates are no longer permitted to perform diplomatic or consular functions, and those who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents must depart the United States .\n\nQ I guess what I'm trying to figure out is why didn't this happen nine months ago when I think the Assad regime --\n\nMR. CARNEY : As I said, following the announcement that the Syrian embassy suspended its provision of consular services and in consideration of the atrocities perpetrated by the Assad regime, this step was taken. I think the suspension of consular services was the nearer-term precipitating event.\n\nQ That's more of the tipping point. Ambassador McFaul said today -- said this morning in response to Putin's speech that there should be more -- that the President should be enacting more sanctions today, that our new response should take place today.\n\nMR. CARNEY : Well, I think I said that --\n\nQ And Vice President Biden seemed to hint that more is coming.\n\nMR. CARNEY : Well, more is coming.\n\nQ When?\n\nMR. CARNEY : I don't have timing for you. But work is being done to make further designations. And obviously when --\n\nQ It will continue to be on the individual?\n\nMR. CARNEY : I'm not going to itemize what's under consideration or what the decisions will be. The authorities under the two executive orders are broad and give us the tools we need to take appropriate action as we see fit, given the decisions by the Russian government.\n\nQ And can you give us more on the Merkel phone call?\n\nMR. CARNEY : The President spoke with Chancellor Merkel not that along ago, today, about Ukraine , about the collaboration that the two leaders have engaged in with our shared allies and others to ensure that the actions in Ukraine , in Crimea, the transgressions by the Russian government are not viewed as legitimate by the international community. And that effort is clear to see, and it was evidenced by the 13 to 1 vote --\n\nQ She agreed with that?\n\nMR. CARNEY : I'm not going to speak for Chancellor Merkel, but I would point you to her public statements, which have been quite clear and strong on this matter, and on the need for further steps to be taken in response to Russia's actions.\n\nQ And I want to get a response to Mitt Romney's op-ed today that seemed to suggest that the President takes too -- that he's left with bad options because he takes too long to make decisions in certain situations, whether it's Syria or Russia , on foreign policy. I just didn't know if you had a response to --\n\nMR. CARNEY : I don't have a response.\n\nQ There's nothing you want -- anything to say in response to his --\n\nMR. CARNEY : I'll resist.\n\nAll the way in the back.\n\nQ Thanks, Jay. Two questions on the missing flight. First, Malaysia is criticized of lacking cooperation with the FBI . Is the White House frustrated with that?\n\nMR. CARNEY : You'll have to repeat. You said, Malaysia is criticizing?\n\nQ Of lacking cooperation with the FBI .\n\nQ Criticized for.\n\nQ For -- yes.\n\nMR. CARNEY : What I can tell you is that the Malaysian government has the lead in this investigation. U.S. officials are in Kuala Lumpur , as you know, working closely with the Malaysian government on the investigation.\n\nThis is a difficult and unusual situation, and we are working hard, in close collaboration with the Malaysian government and other partners, to investigate a number of possible scenarios for what happened to the flight. Our hearts of course go out to the families of the passengers. They are in a truly agonizing situation.\n\nWe remain fully committed to assisting the Malaysians and working with our other international partners on this investigation, on this effort. And we are providing assistance through the NTSB, through the FAA and through the FBI . So I haven't seen the report that you're mentioning. I can assure you that we are in a close, collaborative relationship as regards this investigation.<\/p>\n\nQ And also, there are some new reports saying that the missing flight could have landed in the U.S. military base, Diego Garcia , in the central of Indian Ocean . Do you rule in that or rule out that?\n\nMR. CARNEY : I'll rule that one out.\n\nBill.\n\nQ You mentioned earlier that there will be costs. Again, you said that yesterday, you said it today. But a lot of people who have looked at the sanctions that were imposed yesterday have found them to be minimal, and in some cases risible. Mr. Rogozin said that they were written by a prankster. And, in fact, a lot of the people who were sanctioned don't have any assets in the U.S. So --\n\nMR. CARNEY : Or say they don't.\n\nQ Or say they don't. So how do these bite? I mean, what --\n\nMR. CARNEY : Bill, what I can tell you is that the actions taken against 11 individuals were part of a process that will continue because of continued unwillingness by Russia to resolve this in a way that's consistent with international law. And the costs have been real and they will increase. I'm not going to get into a guessing game about what the decision-making process is among President Putin and his advisors about steps moving forward or the acceptability of the rising costs that are being imposed on Russia for Russia's actions.\n\nWhat I can tell you is those costs are real and they will increase.\n\nQ What are those costs? I mean, we don't have any indication from you what you think the costs are.\n\nMR. CARNEY : No, that's -- because somebody pops off for a television camera doesn't mean that the costs aren't real; that blocking of assets -- access to assets, blocking of an individual's ability to travel are not real consequences. And as outlined in the two executive orders that the President signed, there are authorities in those orders to expand considerably the sanctions imposed in response to Russia's refusal to reverse course in this matter. And so the costs will increase.\n\nAnd as we just discussed with regard to one of the provisions, one of the descriptions of those who could be sanctioned under yesterday's executive order, they include individuals who are influential with, close to, and provide material support to leading government officials but are not members of the government. I think anyone who understands how the Russian system of governance works and who has influence in that system understands the kind of person that we're talking about here, and the fact that they have substantial assets not just in Russia but abroad.\n\nQ Exactly to that point: People have pointed out that the people who were sanctioned yesterday are not the top-level oligarchs of Russia . They are people who have some influence --\n\nMR. CARNEY : I don't disagree with that, but I'm not sure what your point is. We took steps yesterday identifying 11 people. Further steps will be taken, as I've made clear today, in response to Russia's continued refusal to avail itself of the means to resolve this diplomatically in a dialogue with the Ukrainian government, with the participation of international interlocutors, through the presence of U.N. and OSCE monitors in Ukraine ; through a process that is established under Ukrainian law and the constitution that would allow for the legal discussion of decisions, like changing the status of a region within the sovereign state of Ukraine . These are all options available to Russia , available to those in Crimea who have taken this step. Russia has not availed itself of those options, thus there will be further costs imposed not just by the United States but by others.\n\nQ You don't really expect the Russians to walk back what they did this morning, do you?\n\nMR. CARNEY : I'm not going to psychoanalyze motivations or behavior, and I'm not going to predict actions. What I can say is that we have been very clear that there are costs to this behavior; those costs have been imposed and are increasing as the behavior continues.\n\nQ But they just don't look very severe.\n\nMR. CARNEY : Bill, I get your point. It's yours to have. I can tell you what we're doing and what our policy is.\n\nEd.\n\nQ Jay, can I ask you about health care? You started out by saying 5 million people have enrolled. Is that the correct word, \"enrolled,\" since we still don't know how many people have actually paid their premiums? Is it 5 million signed up? Will we get the information on who has actually enrolled and paid their premiums?\n\nMR. CARNEY : CMS is working to provide more detailed data on who has already paid their premiums, what percentage of the population of enrollees that includes. We can point you to major insurers who have placed that figure at 80 percent, give or take, depending on the insurer. But we don't have specific data that is in a reliable enough form to provide. I think it's consistent with how these things tend to work.\n\nAnd what is ironic to me, I think it was -- in some ways it seems like yesterday and in some ways it seems like five years ago instead of five months ago -- but I doubt, based on the questions I got in the room at the time, that anybody would have done anything but laugh if I had said there would be 5 million enrollees by March 18th .\n\nQ The last time Secretary Sebelius did a call with CMS officials a couple weeks ago with enrollment figures, they did say -- as you say -- they're working on the data; they hope to have that data soon about who's paid. Do you anticipate it would be by the end of March?\n\nMR. CARNEY : I would refer you to CMS. I understand what's happening here, which is the battle to discredit the process has been lost on the grounds of -- in the arena of nobody is going to enroll, healthcare.gov is a disaster, the whole thing is going to collapse of its own weight. Well, that didn't happen, and I apologize to those who were hoping it would.\n\nBut, you know, what we are doing is systematically implementing a law that provides enormous benefits to millions of Americans who are making clear that they want us to do that by the demand they're showing. Every time there's an issue that needs to be resolved, we are going about the business of resolving it. Every time there's data that we are able to provide in a responsible way, we provide it. And that's going to be the case here.\n\nWhat I can tell you is a lot of people have signed up; a lot more will sign up. They're signing up because they want the benefits provided by the options available to them, and I am confident that no matter what the number is on April 1st , there will be those who find it insufficient.\n\nQ Last one. One reason people have to go to the exchanges to get covered is if they're looking for a new job. And so I wonder if you think you're going to be looking for health care and going to the exchanges any time soon. (Laughter.)\n\nMR. CARNEY : I would say a couple of things about reports on personnel moves at the White House , which is the level of accuracy is inversely proportional to the quality of the sources.\n\nQ So can we get your take on it then? So we can get the most accurate version, let's get it from you.\n\nMR. CARNEY : I have a great job that I love.\n\nYes, sir.\n\nQ Thank you, Jay. Vice President Biden with Polish President Komorowski this morning. President Komorowski said he was not surprised of Russia's move in Ukraine because the Russian budget defense had grown 400 percent in the last eight years, and he criticized NATO members who have scaled back their defense spending. Does the White House agree or believe that NATO members, considering the Ukrainian crisis, should reconsider their military spending?\n\nMR. CARNEY : Well, I didn't see those particular comments, but I can certainly understand the concern and suspicion on behalf of Polish officials with regards to what Russia has been doing in Ukraine . I think that if you look at overall military spending by this country, say, from 10 years ago, you'd see dramatic increases, even as we now rationalize our military spending after having ended one war and being in the process of ending another.\n\nWhat I would also say is that if you look at the President's submitted budget, it contains within it both a topline for defense spending and an additional $25 billion through the security and investment fund that we certainly hope Congress will support, because we believe that is an appropriate additional amount of spending that we should see in our defense budget.\n\nQ And how about the NATO members?\n\nMR. CARNEY : I'll wait until we talk to NATO , or hear what the institution itself has to say. I don't have at my fingertips figures on defense spending by NATO members.\n\nApril.\n\nQ Jay, on two subjects; one on health care. You're over 5 million enrolled. What is the anticipation of this White House for March 31st ? What are your numbers for March 31st ? What are you expecting?\n\nMR. CARNEY : Now, you know I'm not going to do that, April.\n\nQ No, I don't know.\n\nMR. CARNEY : All I can tell you is that we have a lot of people who have signed up and there are going to be more. Our goal has always been to get a substantial number and for it to be demographically and geographically allocated in a way that allows the marketplaces to function effectively. We believe very strongly that we'll achieve those goals.\n\nThere's been some talk over the months about what target figures there are, and CBO has made estimates and revised estimates, and I can point you to the CBO for the CBO's figures. What I can tell you is, since the very, very rocky start that this enrollment period endured, we have seen substantial interest rewarded with an ability consummated to enroll in insurance coverage through the marketplaces. That's a good thing.\n\nThe purpose of the law was to make sure that Americans across the country had options available to them for quality, affordable health insurance. And that is being realized. We have a lot of work to do. We're 13 days out. A lot of people can and will still enroll, and we are doing a multifaceted campaign to reach as many people as we can so that they know what their options are and they know that March 31st is the deadline and they need to enroll by then or they won't be able to until next year.\n\nQ So was it out of the realm of possibility that 7 million could be met? Especially as this weekend the President told those workers at QSSI that he's anticipating large numbers to come in on the site and through the other sites that are linked to the federal government to register.\n\nMR. CARNEY : I think we've all learned through hard experience not to predict success but to do the hard work necessary to create success when it comes to this effort. And there are a lot of people working extremely hard to ensure that the website is functioning, that all the various issues that need to be resolved as we smooth out the transition here are being resolved effectively for the American people. And that work is going to continue right up until the deadline, and it will continue beyond that in the various efforts that need to continue to work.\n\nSo what we feel positive about is that since the wretched start to healthcare.gov, we have seen a system that has functioned effectively for the millions of Americans who want it to work for them. And it was on us to fix the problems, and some very talented people worked hard to make that happen.\n\nWe've got 13 days left, and I want everybody -- and I know the audience isn't huge -- but anybody who is out there watching should be aware that March 31st is the deadline and they need to make sure they have the information they want and need so that they can enroll by March 31st .\n\nQ And last topic. What would it take to see a G8 again versus a G7? I mean, what would it take for Russia to come back into the fold?\n\nMR. CARNEY : I wouldn't put it in terms of that institution and the meetings and the summits it holds. I would simply say that the suspension of preparations for that G8 Summit are the result -- that that suspension is the result of the actions that Russia has taken. So the positive that would come out of Russia reversing course might include restoring preparations for the G8 in general, but I think the positives are far greater than that as a general matter.\n\nJared. Go ahead, Jared, and then Jon.\n\nQ You described the costs to Russia as real and significant, and they've been effective. Can you at this point point to any hesitation or any reversal of course that Russia has made due to the sanctions and the other costs that the United States has put into place?\n\nMR. CARNEY : Jared, I want to congratulate you on the penetrating question. I think it's very clear that Russia continues to pursue a course that is in direct violation of international law, that directly contradicts its obligations under international treaties and understandings and memoranda that it has with Ukraine and other nations. And that's why we're taking the actions we're taking, and that's why the costs will increase until Russia changes course.\n\nQ But at this point you can count no successes?\n\nMR. CARNEY : You've seen what's happened today. I'm not sure your point, except that as long as Russia -- I mean, you're reinforcing the point. Yes, if Russia refuses to change course, it will incur more costs imposed by us, imposed by our friends and allies around the world, and imposed in general by the global economy.\n\nJon.\n\nQ I just want a couple clarifications. You said the United States will never recognize this annexation that Russia has done today. Does that mean that the sanctions that have been put in place are going to remain in place until Russia reverses what it has done?\n\nMR. CARNEY : Sanctions will increase. Designations will be forthcoming. So it's hard for me to put a pin on what the ongoing consequences of that kind of action would be. What I can say without question is that this action, the results of the referendum, and the attempt to annex a region of Ukraine illegally will never be recognized by the United States or the international community.\n\nQ And should we then assume -- and I think you strongly implied it, so I'll just ask directly -- the G8 Summit in Sochi will not happen unless Russia reverses course?\n\nMR. CARNEY : All I can say right now, Jon, is that preparations for that summit have been suspended. Summits don't occur without preparations; those preparations don't look likely to be resumed any time soon. But I don't have an announcement to make about that at this time.\n\nWe are focused on, as we have been throughout this situation, providing support to Ukraine , rallying the international community in opposition to these actions, and conveying very clearly to the Russians what we believe are very sensible options for them to take when it comes to ensuring that their interests in Ukraine are protected and recognized.\n\nQ On the seven Russians that were sanctioned, assets freezed -- can you tell us, do any of them have assets in the United States ?\n\nMR. CARNEY : That's not information I have. I would refer you to the Department of Treasury for those kinds of questions. What I can tell you is those named in the seven -- there were four others under the other designation -- the seven you mention are very well known and prominent members of the Russian government or the Duma, and they fall under the category of Russian government officials that was spelled out in the executive order. That executive order contains within it expansive authorities for the designation of other individuals and entities. And what I can tell you is that you should expect further action to be taken as Russia continues down this path.\n\nQ And just a political question. Earlier today, the Chairman of the Republican Party predicted a Republican \"tsunami\" this fall. I'm just wondering if political forecasters here at the White House see signs of a Republican \"tsunami\" on the horizon?\n\nMR. CARNEY : It's an interesting choice of words. But I think that the President is focused on and Democrats are focused on a message that supports the policy priorities that we have, which consist of steps we can take to expand opportunity and reward hard work and responsibility in this country. And that policy approach is supported by a substantial percentage of Americans across the country. And that's the way we approach this election cycle, because elections in the end are about who makes the decisions going forward in Congress , in this case when it comes to policy.\n\nAnd we're always engaged in a debate about what the proper policies are when it comes to how do we grow our economy, how do we expand opportunity, how do we reward hard work. What to me doesn't seem like a particularly substantive argument is that we're against everything they're for and we'll get back to you about what we're for. It certainly does leave the opening for those who might make the counter argument that, therefore, the policies that helped precipitate the worst recession since the Great Depression, that's not a great place to be.\n\nQ Do you agree with your predecessor, Robert Gibbs , on the likelihood of the Republicans taking over the Senate ? I mean, it's not -- the Republicans --\n\nMR. CARNEY : I didn't see him say that was likely. I don't think it's likely at all. I think the Senate is going to be retained by Democrats for the reasons I just described.\n\nQ Jay, you said of the G7 side meeting next week that they would discuss modes of assistance to Ukraine . A Senate delegation that went over there late last week or whatever, Senator John McCain at the very least has come back and said that the United States and NATO should consider sending some kind of defensive military hardware -- anti-aircraft, anti-tank hardware, whatever. Is that one of the modes of assistance that will be considered at that meeting next week?\n\nMR. CARNEY : Well, we have said -- and I'll repeat -- that we are reviewing requests by the Ukrainian government, and we are -- and we'll continue to do that. Our focus, however, remains on supporting economic and diplomatic measures aimed at de-escalating the situation in Ukraine . But we're reviewing a variety of requests and running a process that evaluates what forms of assistance we and our partners can provide aimed at a focus that still hopes to see this situation de-escalate rather than escalate.\n\nQ Have they requested significant amounts of military?\n\nMR. CARNEY : I would refer you to the Ukrainian government.\n\nAlexis, then Roger.\n\nQ Jay, one quick question to follow up. Because a lot of the relationships, international relationships with Russia are under some scrutiny or reevaluation, do you happen to know whether the World Trade Organization is something that Russia might lose its membership in? It worked so hard to get into the WTO. Is that at risk?\n\nMR. CARNEY : I haven't heard that specific conversation. I think that, in general, Russia's credibility and stature internationally is affected by these actions. The system that is in place through organizations with broad international membership that affect trade and politics, if you will, through the United Nations and other organizations depend on a fealty to the rule of law, a shared commitment to resolve differences through legal means.\n\nAnd what we have seen of late by the actions taken by the Russians in Crimea is an undermining of and a violation of those principles that undergird that structure that supports all of these international institutions. So it certainly affects their standing within the world community. I don't know at this point how to answer questions about status or membership within any specific organization.\n\nRoger, last question.\n\nQ Thank you. The Vice President in Poland this morning talked about diversifying the region's energy supply. Can you talk a little bit more about what the Vice President has in mind and what possibly the U.S. role will be?\n\nMR. CARNEY : I think that there has been a lot of focus, for good reason, on the secure energy needs of Europe in general and which nations depend on which other nations for their energy supplies. What we have said is that we're taking immediate steps to assist Ukraine , including in the area of energy security, energy efficiency and energy sector reform. In addition, we understand that there has been no interruption of oil and natural gas exports from Russia to Ukraine and Europe . European gas inventories, as I think I pointed out the other day, are well above normal levels at this time due to a milder than usual winter in Europe and could replace a loss of Russian exports for several months if necessary.\n\nIt's also important when you look at the question of energy security and Ukraine , that any disruption to Russia's energy shipment to Ukraine and Europe is a lose-lose situation for everyone, with Russia being the biggest loser. They depend heavily on Europe and Ukraine as critical export markets for its natural gas, and they earn something like $50 billion per year from those sales. You remember that a lot of the supplies to Europe run through Ukraine . So we're evaluating steps that Ukraine can take when it comes to energy security to energy efficiency and energy sector reform, and mindful of all the things that I just mentioned.\n\nQ This would be on the agenda for The Hague next week, you think?\n\nMR. CARNEY : I don't want to get more specific than I was earlier. Ukraine is the subject, will be the principal subject of that conversation. I obviously leave it up to the leaders to decide the particulars. Thank you all very much.\n\nTNS 30FurigayJane-140120-4673509 30FurigayJane","26":"The Right Opinion Abuse of Power Endangers the Nation's Health\n\nWhen liberal pro-Obama scholars question the legality of President Barack Obama\u2019s actions to implement Obamacare, the issue of illegal presidential use of power moves from partisan to frightening.\n\nGeorge Washington Law School\u2019s Jonathan Turley is the second most quoted law professor in the nation and a two-time Obama voter. He recently testified before Congress on Obama\u2019s extensive use of executive orders and administrative actions to make unilateral changes in Obamacare, immigration policy, minimum wage and the IRS qualifying standards for non-profit status.\n\nAs to Obamacare, Obama, so far, changed it in at least a dozen major ways, including, but not limited to, postponing the employer mandate, allowing insurance carriers to let their insured keep an old policy, and, more recently, redefining the Obamacare \u201chardship\u201d exemption so broadly as to nullify the individual mandate for at least two more years.\n\nWas this legal?\n\nTurley said: \u201cPresident Obama has repeatedly violated this (separation of powers) doctrine in the circumvention of Congress in areas ranging from health care to immigration law to environmental law. We are in the midst of a constitutional crisis with sweeping implications for our system of government. \u2026 \u201d We are now at the constitutional tipping point for our system.\u201c\n\nTurley challenged Congress to re-assert its authority. \"If balance is to be reestablished,\u201d he said, \u201cit must begin before this President leaves office, and that will likely require every possible means to reassert legislative authority. No one in our system can \u2018go it alone\u2019 \u2013 not Congress, not the courts, and not the President.\u201d\n\nObama sold Obamacare with many now-broken promises. Saving costs was a big one. In 2009, the Congressional Budget Office set the net cost of Obamacare at $599 billion over 10 years \u2013 citing a gross cost of $848 billion less $249 billion in tax revenues and other cost savings. But recently the CBO revised the 10-year price tag to more than $2 trillion.\n\nEconomist Jonathan Gruber, the father of Romneycare \u2013 which was the template for Obamacare \u2013 recently admitted that well, no, costs will not be going down. \u201cCovering people with health insurance doesn\u2019t save money,\u201d said Gruber. \u201cThat was sometimes a misleading motivator for the Affordable Care Act. The law isn\u2019t designed to save money. It\u2019s designed to improve health, and that\u2019s going to cost money.\u201d\n\nSo, Obamacare won\u2019t save money, but at least those too poor to afford health insurance will now lead healthier lives, right? Not necessarily.\n\nOregon expanded its Medicaid program years ago \u2013 the way Obamacare does now \u2013 to include some of Oregon\u2019s low-income uninsured. Because of costs, Oregon did this on a random lottery basis. Some got it, some, unfortunately, wanted to but couldn\u2019t. But this allows comparisons. Oregon, for example, can now compare the health outcomes of the now-insured Oregonians against those who wanted to get insurance, but couldn\u2019t. Surely, the now-insured are healthier compared to those without health insurance.\n\nBut there were no significant differences in their health care outcomes. While the newly insured did increase their doctor visits for preventative and primary-care services, some could not get appointments with doctors, many of whom wouldn\u2019t take new Medicaid patients. Emergency room use went up 40 percent among the new Medicaid patients, not down \u2013 all for non-emergency medical needs. Forbes health care researcher Avik Roy writes, \u201cThe result calls into question the $450 billion a year we spend on Medicaid, and the fact that Obamacare throws 11 million more Americans into this broken program.\u201d\n\nWorse, the uninsured dislike Obamacare even more than do those with health insurance. A recent Kaiser Health poll found that among the uninsured, only 22 percent have a favorable attitude toward Obamacare, a far-lower percentage than the 56 percent of uninsured who are unfavorable toward Obamacare.\n\nBefore Obama became president, he said if he were \u201cstarting from scratch,\u201d he\u2019d go with a single-payer system. A few months ago, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid was asked whether Obamacare would lead us to single-payer. Reid said, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d This is the real plan.\n\nSingle-payer is universal healthcare system used in Canada. It remains popular. But in 2009, the incoming president of the Canadian Medical Association said: \u201c(Canadian doctors) all agree that the system is imploding.

He said: \u201cA health care revolution has passed us by\u201d and \u201ccompetition should be welcomed, not feared.\u201d So while the Canadian Medical Association urges more competition and privatization, America moves toward even more government involvement in health care.\n\nIn the annual index of countries rated on \u201ceconomic freedom,\u201d the United States \u2013 since 2008 \u2013 has slipped from the No. 5 position to No. 12.

Economic freedom and prosperity go hand in hand.\n\nYet this administration makes it clear it is more interested in wealth re-distribution and less interested in wealth creation. President Obama is quite adept at the former \u2013 clueless about how to achieve the latter.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2014 LAURENCE A. ELDER\n\nDISTRIBUTED BY CREATORS.COM","27":"Wednesday\u2019s prediction of Obamacare doom came with a pretty blunt headline: \u201cO-care Premiums to Skyrocket.\u201d It accompanied an article, written by Elise Viebeck of the Hill, in which some anonymous insurance company officials predicted that premiums in some Obamacare exchanges would increase sharply for 2015. One official, from a \u201cswing state,\u201d actually said his firm was planning to triple its rates. It was only a matter of time before it became part of the right-wing conversation, which means\u2014I\u2019m just guessing\u2014it\u2019s only a matter of time before it\u2019s part of a Koch Brothers ad on your local television station.\n\nAs usual, the real news here is more complicated and ambiguous. The possibility of higher-than-normal rate increases in some parts of the country is real enough, for several reasons. Chief among them: Insurance companies may have expected a better mix of beneficiaries\u2014in other words, more healthy people and fewer sicker ones. If so, the companies could discover that the premiums they set for this year are too low to cover the medical bills they must pay to doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, and the like. If that happens, the insurers could respond by raising premiums next year, perhaps substantially. Serious, honest people are worried about this scenario unfolding, based in part on rumblings they are picking up from within the insurance industry. \u201cThere is extensive concern about rate increases next year,\u201d Caroline Pearson, vice president of Avalere Health, told the Fiscal Times. \u201cParticularly since exchange enrollment is skewed toward older enrollees, some are concerned that plans will need to raise prices in 2015.\u201d\n\nBut as Pearson also pointed out\u2014and as all the \"could\"s and \"if\"s in the above paragraph imply\u2014nobody really knows what\u2019s going to happen. That includes the insurers themselves. Open enrollment hasn\u2019t even ended yet. People can sign up for insurance until March 31 and, by all accounts, the pace of enrollment has quickened with the deadline approaching. Historically, young and healthy people have been the last to sign up. That\u2019s certainly where the Obama Administration and its allies are focusing outreach efforts, with appeals via sports celebrities, over social media, and, of course, between the ferns.\n\nIt\u2019s also not clear exactly what insurers were expecting in the first place\u2014or how widely spread the anxiety over enrollment patterns is. As the very same Hill story noted, insurance company executives have been relatively sanguine lately, both in public statements and, more recently, in anonymous quotes for other outlets about the new insurance system\u2019s stability. The confidence from those statements could simply be happy talk, designed to calm nervous investors. Then again, the angst in Wednesday\u2019s Hill story could also be its own form of propaganda, designed to put pressure on Obama and his allies at a time when they are weighing how much to cut payments to the insurers who participate in the Medicare Advantage program.","28":"Oops, we can't seem to find that page\n\nWhy not try searching for it using our site search.

Rather than stroke checks to insurers to make up for the huge sums they\u2019ll lose by participating in Obamacare\u2019s exchanges, Congress should scrap the law altogether.\n\nHere\u2019s how the risk corridors work. If an insurer has to pay claims that are 3 percent more than projected, the government must reimburse the insurer for half the excess payments. If claims are 8 percent or more beyond projections, the government reimburses about 75 percent of the losses.\n\nIf costs are lower than projected, insurers are supposed to pay the government. Because estimates of Obamacare\u2019s cost have marched steadily upward since the law passed, though, that outcome seems unlikely. Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office now estimates that Obamacare will cost more than $2 trillion through 2024 \u2014 more than double its initial projection.\n\nWithout the promise of a bailout, many insurers would have been reluctant to sell through the exchanges, due to the high probability of \u201cadverse selection.\u201d That\u2019s the insurance-industry term for having too many old and sick customers \u2014 and not enough young and healthy ones.\n\nIf that happens, then the insurance risk pools become imbalanced. Insurers end up paying out more in claims than they receive in premiums. If the \u201cselection\u201d is \u201cadverse\u201d enough, the whole system collapses.\n\nInsurers\u2019 fears are increasingly looking justified.\n\nMany Americans have had trouble enrolling because of technical problems with both federal and state exchange websites.\n\nMeanwhile, the president has declared that the approximately 5 million Americans whose policies were cancelled because of Obamacare won\u2019t have to pay tax penalties in 2014 designed to force them into the exchanges. The special dispensation was granted after a public outcry about the president\u2019s promise that Americans would be able to keep their existing coverage under his health reform plan.\n\nYounger Americans are realizing that they\u2019re going to pay higher premiums to subsidize coverage for older Americans, even though the latter group is, on average, wealthier. For millions of young adults, remaining uninsured \u2014 whereby they can pay the individual mandate penalty of $95 or 1 percent of income, whichever is greater, starting April 1 \u2014 will be cheaper than getting covered. So they\u2019re staying away from the marketplaces.\n\nA December Kaiser Family Foundation report described a 25 percent enrollment rate among 18-34 year olds as a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d that could cost insurers more than half their profit margin.\n\nThat worst-case scenario is now reality. Manhattan Institute Senior Fellow Avik Roy notes that \u201c25 percent of non-elderly adults who selected an exchange plan were younger than 35,\u201d according to January data.\n\nObamacare\u2019s supporters say that they envisioned these hiccups. Indeed, the law plainly states that Obamacare \u201cshall establish and administer a program of risk corridors for calendar years 2014, 2015 and 2016\u201d to help the exchanges outlast any growing pains.\n\nWe\u2019re just two months into their first year, though, and the White House is already talking about extending them three more years. That means the Obama administration expects the exchanges to be financially unsustainable for at least six years after their launch.\n\nHow long are Americans supposed to wait before Obamacare starts working?\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, isn\u2019t willing to wait any longer. He\u2019s looking to repeal the risk corridors. \u201cThe American people are sick of Washington picking winners and losers, especially since the chosen losers often end up being taxpayers who foot the bills for Washington\u2019s mistakes,\u201d said Mr. Rubio. \u201cEliminating Obamacare\u2019s blank check for a bailout of insurance companies is a common-sense step to protect taxpayers when Obamacare fails.\u201d\n\nObamacare is already set to cost taxpayers more than $2 trillion over the next decade. Funneling federal money to insurers through 2019 to get them to play ball on the exchanges \u2014 as the administration appears to want to do \u2014 will drive that price tag even higher. Congress should put a stop to this ill-advised bailout.\n\nSally C. Pipes is president, CEO and Taube Fellow in Health Care Studies at the Pacific Research Institute.

Nevada\u2019s exchange said Thursday it will consider a similar 60-day grace period.\n\nAnd in Washington state, exchange spokeswoman Bethany Frey said customers prevented from enrolling by March 31 because of a system error will have their applications reviewed \u201con a case-by-case basis.\u201d\n\nThe state efforts have not been blessed by the Obama administration, which flatly rejected the additional time.\n\n\u201cThe deadline is March 31,\u201d a Health and Human Services Department spokeswoman said.\n\nBut Matthew Lawrence, a fellow at Harvard Law School, said it\u2019s no surprise the administration is talking tough now \u2014 though it ultimately might find a plausible legal basis to help people bypass the March 31 deadline.\n\n\u201cI expect the administration to wait before announcing any retroactive \u2018fix\u2019 for those who tried and failed for fear that an announcement before the deadline could give people a license to procrastinate,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the White House, press secretary Jay Carney said the administration is confident it\u2019ll have enough sign-ups by the end of the month, including enough young, healthy people, to make the economics of Obamacare work.\n\nHealthier adults are needed to create a balanced risk pool and keep premiums in check when insurers take stock of the first round of enrollment and set prices for the coming year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident that come April 1, you will see a demographic mix that is equal to the objective, which is to ensure that actuarially the marketplaces function effectively,\u201d Mr. Carney said.\n\nOnce final enrollment numbers are known, the next question will be what insurers do with premiums headed into 2015.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius recently told Congress she thinks premiums will rise in the coming year, but at a slower rate than usual because of the law.\n\nSome industry professionals disagreed with Mrs. Sebelius assessment in news reports, saying premiums could spike multifold in some areas because of the troubled rollout.\n\nDan Mendelson, CEO of the Avalere health care consultancy in Washington, said a spike in premiums on the Obamacare marketplace is feasible, although likely a \u201cnot massive\u201d one, and that the exchanges should remain competitive.\n\nHe said the March 31 deadline is in place in part to give companies a chance to take stock of where things are.\n\n\u201cYou have to allow plans to reset, think about premiums and have a structured process,\u201d he said.\n\nAny tangible spike this year would damage Democratic candidates who supported the law and are up for re-election in November, as Republicans have made it clear they will wield Obamacare\u2019s troubles as a truncheon during the mid-term contests.\n\nThe law\u2019s stumbles are even causing intraparty problems in Maryland, where Democratic candidates to succeed Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley are sparring over the state\u2019s glitchy exchange website and the governor is trying to stem any bleeding over the coming days.\n\nOn Tuesday, it announced a stopgap measure to help \u2014 through telephone guidance \u2014 anyone who tried to sign up by March 31, but couldn\u2019t complete their application by that date.\n\nKentucky\u2019s exchange will allow people to apply for coverage by March 31 and pick a plan by April 15, exchange spokeswoman Gwenda Bond said.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

In fact, he spoke of families saving a cool $2500 a year. As with all socialist redistribution schemes, there are some people doing better under the Affordable Care Act\u2026 but most of us are not, and quite a few Americans are reeling from incredible premium hikes, followed up by enormous deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs if they actually try to use their benefits.\n\nAnd it\u2019s going to get worse. A lot worse. You have scarcely begun to pay for Obama\u2019s folly, America.\n\nThe horror stories keep piling up, faster than Democrats can scream they\u2019re all a bunch of liars. A Nevada man lamed Larry Basich fought his way into the bug storm on ObamaCare launch day, kept plugging away at the garbage ObamaCare computer systems until November, finally managed to buy a plan and pay his first premium, then suffered a heart attack, requiring triple bypass surgery\u2026 at which point he discovered the \u201cconfused\u201d state ObamaCare exchange never actually assigned him to an insurance provider.\n\nFour months later, Basich is sitting on $407,000 in unpaid hospital bills. He \u201cblames his back-and-forth with the exchange in December at least in part for the stress that caused his heart attack,\u201d according to the Las Vegas Review Journal. Everyone involved in the system claims they\u2019re working super-hard to get his bills taken care of, but thus far most of that work has involved the exchange contractor and two different insurance providers pointing fingers of blame at each other. The contractor actually took a stab at blaming Mr. Basich for the whole mess because, like many other Americans who made honest and persistent efforts to use the disastrous computer systems ObamaCare foisted on us, he ended up generating multiple online applications.\n\nAnd of course, Basich\u2019s senator is the sinister Harry Reid, famous for loudly declaring that all ObamaCare horror stories are untrue. Reid hasn\u2019t been much help, although his staff made a big production of calling Basich every day to work on a problem their boss claimed was pure fantasy from the floor of the Senate. Punchline: Basich\u2019s insurance broker estimates at least 20 other customers have problems of similar magnitude, while only about 5 percent of Nevada Health Link enrollments went through problem-free.\n\nThat\u2019s going to leave a lot of people saddled with big bills, and the attendant financial problems that come with crushing debts, plus the wasted hours invested in clearing up problems that wouldn\u2019t have existed without ObamaCare. Someday we\u2019ll see a solid estimate of the value of all the hours Americans have burned off dealing with ObamaCare problems. It will probably double the first year cost of the program. Of course, Big Government politicians don\u2019t think the time of private-sector Americans has any real value.\n\nPastor Tony Angran of Iowa got a bad case of ObamaCare sticker shock to go along with his diagnosis of esophageal cancer, discovering that his \u201cAffordable\u201d Care Act plan would cost him $800 a month, plus $7000 worth of copayments. He finds Obama\u2019s health care plan lacking in compassion. Maybe he\u2019ll feel better if Harry Reid calls him a liar from the floor of the Senate.\n\nIt\u2019s too bad we\u2019ve already wasted so much time and effort on Obama\u2019s Big Government boondoggle, because that\u2019s money and energy we could have put toward developing real solutions to the problems with health insurance, circa 2008. Instead, we have a whole new batch of problems, and a large number of people who never did anything wrong \u2013 people who \u201cworked hard and played by the rules,\u201d according to one of President Obama\u2019s favorite phrases \u2013 have been made to suffer unnecessarily. The money wasted on the federal and state ObamaCare exchanges alone could have done a lot of good, if invested wisely into actual medicine.\n\nThe worst is yet to come, as The Hill reported on Wednesday morning:\n\nHealth industry officials say ObamaCare-related premiums will double in some parts of the country, countering claims recently made by the administration. The expected rate hikes will be announced in the coming months amid an intense election year, when control of the Senate is up for grabs. The sticker shock would likely bolster the GOP\u2019s prospects in November and hamper ObamaCare insurance enrollment efforts in 2015.\n\nInsurance officials who listened to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius chirp about premium increases slowing in the coming year are scratching their heads in confusion:\n\n\u201cThe increases are far less significant than what they were prior to the Affordable Care Act,\u201d the secretary said in testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee. Her comment baffled insurance officials, who said it runs counter to the industry\u2019s consensus about next year. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty shortsighted because I think everybody knows that the way the exchange has rolled out \u2026 is going to lead to higher costs,\u201d said one senior insurance executive who requested anonymity. The insurance official, who hails from a populous swing state, said his company expects to triple its rates next year on the ObamaCare exchange.\n\nAmong the factors for these 2015 premium hikes are the nasty \u201crisk pool\u201d equations stemming from the reluctance of young and healthy people to buy ObamaCare policies, uncertainty created by President Obama\u2019s incessant tinkering with the law, new fees and regulatory costs\u2026 and the fact that \u201csome insurers initially underpriced their policies to begin with, expecting to raise rates in the second year.\u201d\n\nOnce again, the American people are played for suckers by ObamaCare. But that\u2019s been the story all along, hasn\u2019t it? Insurance experts quoted by The Hill think the Administration is currently working to soften voters up for a big \u201cbackpedal\u201d on Obama\u2019s false promises of lower insurance premiums. He knew he was lying back then, just as he knew he was lying when he made all those false promises about keeping your old plan and doctor. He knew even Democrat control of Congress wouldn\u2019t be enough to push ObamaCare through, if the American people knew what it really held in store for them. The plan was always to manage political fallout with strategic \u201cbackpedaling\u201d later.\n\nAlas, you won\u2019t be able to escape these premium hikes by going outside the ObamaCare exchanges to buy insurance, as President Obama has taken to recommending when he sees Democrat poll numbers droop. A recent survey from eHealthInsurance found people who buy policies outside the exchanges are already paying 39 to 56 percent more than before ObamaCare came along. There are families paying over $2600 a month in California.\n\nNext year\u2019s premium hikes will vary by state, which should make people in certain states very nervous. It doesn\u2019t make much sense to talk about the average national impact of the Affordable Care Act when certain states are teetering on the verge of total collapse. The \u201cfix\u201d will probably involve bailouts, which will oblige the more solvent states to rescue the disaster areas.\n\nAnd speaking of taxes, since people well into the middle class receive tax subsidies for buying ObamaCare insurance, these skyrocketing premiums should have some interesting effects on the federal deficit in coming years, as will the enormous expansion of Medicaid. Soon you\u2019ll hear Democrats angrily insisting that you must pay higher taxes to cover the unexpectedly high cost of their botched health care scheme. There\u2019s no question about whether we\u2019ve paid the last of ObamaCare\u2019s financial costs. The big question is whether Democrats will be finished paying the political cost after 2014.","34":"The mobile shortcut will then be added as an icon on your home screen.\n\nPress your menu button and find the option to bookmark this page (a star icon for some browsers).

After March 31, Americans -- with a few exceptions -- won't be able to buy health insurance for 2014. And unlike the previous deadlines, there seems to be no chance of a last-minute reprieve. It's a good time to take a look at the state of health care reform. Here are seven things we know now about it.\n\n1. The March 31 Deadline Is Firm Don't expect this enrollment deadline to get extended. Most uninsured people will need to buy insurance by then to avoid facing a penalty. How come they mean it this time? There have been lots of extensions and delays to the law, partly because of the botched launch of Healthcare.gov. \"But if you continuously push [the deadline] back, it will look like the policy is a failure, and you're not doing what the law intended, which is to force people to buy coverage,\u201d says John Bowblis. He's an assistant professor of economics at Miami University of Ohio who studies health insurance. Could there be one more delay? Possibly. If there are technical glitches in the final days of enrollment, federal officials are working on a plan to approve sign-ups for everyone who tries to enroll before the deadline. People with low income can apply at any time for Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, though.","36":"404\n\nSorry, the page you requested was not found.\n\nPlease check the URL for mistakes.

John \u201cMick\u201d Nicholson, the current U.S. military commander in Kabul, told the Senate this week that he needs several thousand more troops to stop a stalemated situation from going south. Sen. John McCain suggested that instead of just settling for more gridlock\u2014for playing \u201cnot to lose\u201d\u2014the U.S. needs to implement a more aggressive strategy to drive back and defeat the Taliban.\n\nHow President Trump will rule on Gen. Nicholson\u2019s request is anyone\u2019s guess given that, amid the plethora of words that the president has devoted to other topics (including Nordstrom\u2019s decision to discontinue his daughter\u2019s product line), he has had little to say on the future of Afghanistan even though that country remains one of the two major combat deployments still ongoing for U.S. troops. If I had to hazard a guess, I would venture that the White House, at the urging of Gen. Michael Flynn, the national security adviser who was previously the J-2 (intelligence officer) in Afghanistan, will approve Nicholson\u2019s request but not go much beyond that.\n\nIf so, that would not allow Nicholson to pursue the strategy that McCain urges, of trying to defeat the Taliban. The problem with attempting to do so is that it would require another major troop surge similar to the one in 2009-2010\u2014but one that will be hard to explain to the American people, who will understandably wonder why the earlier surge did not produce more lasting consequences.\n\nThe answer is because of Obama\u2019s self-defeating timeline, which forced U.S. troops to leave Afghan forces prematurely on their own in hard-fought districts where they were unable to preserve earlier gains. Having sacrificed momentum with his overly precipitous exit strategy, Obama has allowed the Taliban to regain lost ground across much of southern Afghanistan. Dislodging the insurgents again will require returning to square one\u2014something that few Americans will have the patience for.\n\nSo in all likelihood the Trump administration will continue to muddle along, trying not to lose rather than attempting to secure a victory. That may not be very satisfying, but under the circumstances it may be the best we can hope for. Allowing Afghanistan to fall to the Taliban would be a dispiriting defeat at the hands of what Trump calls \u201cradical Islamic terrorists,\u201d but trying to defeat those insurgents entirely may require more resources than we are willing to commit\u2014especially when the Taliban continue to enjoy cross-border support in Pakistan.\n\nIt is commonly if erroneously said that in an insurgency all the insurgents need to do is to avoid losing. The opposite is more nearly the case, given that the government remains in power as long as it does not lose, while the insurgents are typically confined\u2014as they are in Afghanistan\u2014to the hinterland. Only if the Taliban continue to grow in power will they pose an existential threat to the state, but the commitment of more U.S. advisers to work closely with the Afghan army, combined with more permissive rules on the use of American airpower which have already been approved by Obama, should be sufficient to prevent that from occurring.\n\nThe cost of this strategy is, of course, that U.S. troops could wind up remaining in Afghanistan for decades. That is clearly an unsatisfactory state of affairs, but it is preferable to the alternative\u2014which would be seeing the Taliban and their Al Qaeda and Haqqani friends returning to power in Kabul.","38":"Department of Health & Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius (Jim Bourg\/Reuters)\n\nThe federal Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) scored on Monday with a cheery press release on Obamacare. \u201cMarketplace Enrollment Hits 5 Million Milestone,\u201d noted the release, which opened with this line: \u201cAs this historic open enrollment period enters its final weeks, millions of Americans are finding quality, affordable coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nPolitico, Washington Post, Associated Press\/Huffington Post, The Hill, Time, the Los Angeles Times, Ed Schultz! \u2014 they all trafficked in the announcement. Who didn\u2019t?\n\nThe HHS announcement had an improvisational, ad hoc feel to it. Unlike the more comprehensive monthly Obamacare reports, it was more of an update, a celebration of a key milestone in the drive to promote Obamacare. Not unlike the Feb. 25 press release \u2014 also popular with the media \u2014 that announced enrollment had hit 4 million.\n\nIn other words, precisely the sort of incremental disclosures that HHS officials months ago said they wouldn\u2019t be providing. Last October, when Healthcare.gov, the vehicle for Obamacare enrollment, was misfiring, reporters hungered for enrollment numbers. HHS wasn\u2019t disclosing them, insisting instead upon a rigid and periodic approach to the numbers. Here\u2019s how the department defended its policy:\n\n\u201cAs with other programs (e.g., Medicare Advantage), HHS plans on issuing regular updates on implementation, including enrollment statistics. We don\u2019t plan to do hourly or daily data releases but anticipate sharing updates at regular intervals. It will likely be released in the middle of the following month to ensure accuracy. HHS needs to coordinate enrollment from different sources (paper, on-line, call centers), verify with insurers, and collect data from states. We are focused on providing accurate information.\u201d\n\nHHS did have a big, strapping justification for playing hard-to-get with the data last October. Massive back-end technical problems hindered compilation of the data, a problem that the media covered at the time. In any case, the Erik Wemple Blog asked HHS why it has adopted a more flexible approach to releasing numbers when those numbers are positive. Spokeswoman Joanne Peters responded:\n\n\u201cWe release detailed enrollment data on a monthly basis, similar to other government programs such as Medicare Advantage. Our top priority is in releasing accurate data, which we can do once we have compiled information from the states, verified with issuers and scrubbed the data. From time to time, we may announce when we have crossed certain milestones in enrollment, but we will continue to release formal enrollment reports on a monthly basis to ensure accuracy.\u201d\n\nHealth-care beat reporters aren\u2019t swayed. One of them noted to the Erik Wemple Blog, \u201cThey say all the time they don\u2019t have numbers when reporters (like me) ask them directly, but when they hit a milestone, they\u2019re quick to push that information out.\u201d\n\nAnd another recently tweeted:\n\nFunny how, when the numbers are good, HHS can turn them around like *that*. @urbaninstitute As of yesterday, #ACA enrollment hit 5 million \u2014 Christopher Flavelle (@cflav) March 18, 2014\n\nUPDATE 4:40 p.m.: Politico\u2019s Kyle Cheney tweets to the Erik Wemple Blog that an article of his had raised issues about HHS\u2019s release of data.","39":"Health insurance premiums will likely skyrocket next year, despite the Obama administration\u2019s consistent assurance that consumers will not experience sticker shock under the president\u2019s health care law.\n\nThat\u2019s according to industry insiders who told The Hill that they are expecting the price of monthly premiums to increase significantly. In some states, rates could increase by as much as 300 percent.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Sticker Shock Found in Deductibles, Not Premiums\n\n\u201cThere is extensive concern about rate increases next year,\u201d said Avalere Health\u2019s Vice President Caroline Pearson. \u201cParticularly since early exchange enrollment is skewed toward older enrollees, some are concerned that plans will need to raise prices in 2015.\u201d\n\nRates won\u2019t be announced until the fall, however, and Pearson cautioned that it\u2019s still too early to know what they are likely to be since the enrollment period for this year is still ongoing.\n\nThe industry\u2019s concerns of rising premiums are largely out of step with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius\u2019s comments at a congressional hearing last week, where the secretary downplayed any potential sticker shock.\n\n\u201cThe increases are far less significant than what they were prior to the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Sebelius said in testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\nRelated: Consumers Hit With Surprise Tax in Obamacare Premium\n\nBut insurers say a combination of Obamacare\u2019s new taxes and fees, as well as rule changes and delays announced to cope with the rocky rollout, will likely contribute to higher than expected rates.\n\nFor instance, the administration\u2019s decision to allow people to keep their old policies likely means that fewer people than anticipated are enrolling on the new exchanges.\n\nThis is bad news for the Obama administration, which has routinely pointed out that premiums on the exchanges are less expensive than comparable employer-based policies. While premiums may be cheaper, out of pocket costs on exchange plans tend to be higher. A survey by HealthPocket.com found the deductibles on the exchange plans were 42 percent higher than employer based policies. But now, insurers say Obamacare consumers can expect to experience sticker shock from both premiums and deductibles.\n\nStill, administration officials as well as health policy experts say the rising cost of premiums and deductibles were an issue even before the law took effect.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that we just don\u2019t know. Premiums were rising 7 to 10 percent a year before the law. So the question is whether we will see a continuation of that sort of single digit increase, as Sebelius said, or whether it will be larger,\u201d MIT professor and one of the architects of Obamacare, Jonathan Gruber told The Hill.\n\nInsurers say not everyone will see premiums rise significantly. That\u2019s because the rates vary depending on the region and carriers available in the area.\n\nFor instance, counties that have a population that skews older or have only one major hospital system in the area will likely be hit with higher premiums. In contrast, places with a mix of healthier younger people and more competition for providers will likely see lower premiums.\n\nCheck out the worst places to live for Obamacare here.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:","40":"When Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius sought to quell concerns about rising premiums under ObamaCare last week, she said: \u201cThe increases [we\u2019re seeing] are far less significant than what they were prior to the Affordable Care Act.\u201d This was an echo of a representative of Sebelius at HHS, Joanne Peters, who told Fox News, \u201cSince the Affordable Care Act became law, health-care costs have been slowing and premium growth has slowed to the lowest rate in years ... making it easier for [small] businesses to offer coverage.\u201d\n\nThese claims surprised health insurance company officials, who have been wrestling with the massive takeover by the government and trying to charge enough to stay solvent. Said one official, on conditions of anonymity: \u201c[These comments are] pretty shortsighted \u2026 everybody knows that [ObamaCare] is going to lead to higher costs.\u201d Privately, the same official said that his company, located in a large swing state, expects to triple its rates next year.\n\nAnother insurance company official stated: \u201cWe\u2019re exasperated. All of these major delays on very significant portions of the law are going to change what it\u2019s going to cost.\u201d Bill Hoagland, a former executive at health insurance company CIGNA, agreed: \u201cMy gut tells me that, for some people, these increases will be significant.\u201d\n\nAnalysts have been trying to estimate precisely what those cost increases are likely to be. Three economists with the Manhattan Institute made their first estimate last September, expanded it later that month, and issued a further broader report in November. Writing in Forbes, one of them said the average increase will be more than 40 percent over current premiums, with some insureds seeing their premiums double:\n\nThis nearly-complete analysis finds that the average state will face underlying premium increases of 41 percent.\n\nMen will have the steepest increases: 77, 37, and 47 percent for 27-year-olds, 40-year-olds, and 64-year-olds, respectively\u2026.\n\nThe eight states that will face the biggest increases in underlying premiums are: Nevada (+179 percent), New Mexico (+142 percent), Arkansas (+138 percent), North Carolina (+136 percent), Vermont (+117 percent), Georgia (+92 percent), South Dakota (+77 percent) and Nebraska (+74 percent).\n\nThe reason young men will suffer the biggest increases under ObamaCare is because they are the healthiest and, under the program, will be expected to carry most of the burden for the others, including women who use more healthcare services than men. ObamaCare requires insurers to charge them the same as men. And older people, who consume up to six times the services that young people do, may not, under those rules, be charged more than three times their premiums.\n\nThere\u2019s also the matter of subsidies, which, because oldsters pay more, will qualify them for higher subsidies. Wrote one of the authors of that study, Avik Roy:\n\n[It\u2019s} a double whammy. Because premiums for those nearing retirement can still be three times higher than those of younger Americans, elderly individuals will disproportionately benefit from ObamaCare\u2019s subsidies.\n\nThe subsidies increase in proportion to the percentage of your income that is tied up in health insurance; for elderly people whose premiums are much higher, the subsidies are higher, too.\n\nAccording to their study, a 27-year-old man was paying an average monthly premium of $133 a month. Now, even after taking subsidies into account, his premiums will jump to $188 a month \u2014 a 41 percent increase. But a 64-year-old woman, whose premiums were $430 a month, will see her premiums actually decrease, to $292 a month.\n\nThe distortion as a result of ObamaCare is obvious: Young men who don\u2019t need medical or health care services very often, will wind up paying for those who do. There\u2019s no other way to make the math work out and keep the insurance companies solvent. Wrote Roy: \u201cObamacare, in the average state, is a massive transfer of wealth from the young to the old.\u201d\n\nThis study preceded one reported by Fox News in February, concluding that rising premiums are going to hurt small business owners as well. Two-thirds of them, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMMS), will see sharp increases in premiums in order to come into compliance with the new law.\n\nReasons for the increases abound. In general, whenever government inserts itself into the private market and overrules what individuals would decide on their own to do about meeting their own personal health care needs, there will be inevitable distortions and unintended consequences. Second, the generic plans provide services that many don\u2019t need, even though they are required to pay for them. For example, how many young single men need maternity coverage, or newborn care, or pediatric services?\n\nThen there are the assumptions insurance companies made in developing their initial premiums under ObamaCare, many of which aren\u2019t being met. One of them \u2014 the assumption that 40 percent of new signups under the plan would be between ages 18 and 34 is turning out to be way off the mark.\n\nIn addition, to stay within the premium guidelines, insurance companies were forced to increase deductibles and co-pays, which are essentially \u201cafter-the-fact\u201d premium increases which won\u2019t show up until an insured undergoes a procedure or partakes of a medical service.\n\nHealth insurance companies will be rolling out their new rates based upon the latest signups and their demographics over the summer. Many of them will discover that they have undercharged and will try to correct those mistakes by building surpluses into their new premium structures. So the surprises will keep coming.\n\nOne of those surprises may just impact negatively precisely those politicians who voted for ObamaCare \u2014 Democrats all \u2014 who are running for reelection in November. By then, all the numbers will be in, and the insureds who are also voters will know exactly what to do when they enter the polling booth. For example, in Iowa, which hosts the first presidential caucus in the country, rates are expected to more than double for many individuals buying ObamaCare on the exchanges and by large double digits for those covered through their employers.\n\nA graduate of Cornell University and a former investment advisor, Bob is a regular contributor to The New American magazine and blogs frequently at www.LightFromTheRight.com, primarily on economics and politics.

Insurers have reported that roughly 20% of Americans who\u2019ve selected plans through the exchanges haven\u2019t made a premium payment, and yet, the media continues to report the numbers as though they\u2019re actual enrollments.\n\nThere may be a \u201csurge\u201d in sign ups on the exchanges, something that was expected as the clock winds down on the open enrollment period, but we\u2019re still a long way from knowing how many Americans have truly enrolled in health plans.\n\nThough the number of overall enrollments is important, what matters more is whether the administration has reached their target demographic \u2014 those between the ages of 18 to 34. That number will tell us much more about whether the Obamacare will be a burden to taxpayers should insurers trigger the law\u2019s bailout provisions.","42":"The Obama administration has said it expects premium increases for health insurance next year to be considerably slower than the pace before implementation of the Affordable Care Act. That's not what insurance industry executives told the Hill:\n\nSome insurers initially underpriced their policies to begin with, expecting to raise rates in the second year.\n\n\n\nOthers, especially in larger states, will continue to hold rates low in order to remain competitive.\n\n\n\nBut insurance officials are quick to emphasize that any spikes would be a consequence of delays and changes in ObamaCare's rollout.\n\n\n\nThey point out that the administration, after a massive public outcry, eased their policies to allow people to keep their old health plans. That kept some healthy people in place, instead of making them jump into the new exchanges.\n\n\n\nFederal health officials have also limited the amount of money the government can spend to help insurers cover the cost of new, sick patients.\n\n\n\nPerhaps most important, insurers have been disappointed that young people only make up about one-quarter of the enrollees in plans through the insurance exchanges, according to public figures that were released earlier this year. That ratio might change in the weeks ahead because the administration anticipates many more people in their 20s and 30s will sign up close to the March 31 enrollment deadline. Many insurers, however, don't share that optimism.\n\n\n\nThese factors will have the unintended consequence of raising rates, sources said.\n\n\"We're exasperated,\" said the senior insurance official. \"All of these major delays on very significant portions of the law are going to change what it's going to cost.\"\n\n\n\nOne executive, described as being \"from a populous swing state,\" expects his company to triple the rates on next year's exchange policies.\n\nTime to freak out about a death spiral? Not yet. Here's some reason for caution:\n\n1) All insurance is local. We've spent a lot of time talking about whether enrollment will get to the 6-7 million the administration projected. In some ways that's much less relevant than what is happening at the state or county level, which is the level at which policies are sold. Some places will have a very small or very sick pool of customers for exchange policies, and those places will have huge increases in their policy costs. Others will have relatively large, robust pools, and the price increases in those areas will be less drastic.\n\nWe should be worried if one insurer in a populous swing state is planning to triple the price of his exchange policies. But you can't extrapolate that nationwide -- and the Hill won't have spoken to executives from more than a handful of companies.\n\n2) The demographics could still improve, at least a bit. Yesterday, I argued that it's close to mathematically impossible for the exchanges to reach their original demographic projections. But it is mathematically possible for them to do better than 25 percent, and they may yet. If I had to guess, I'd expect that the folks waiting until March 30 to choose a policy are disproportionately young.\n\n3) Insurance executives have every incentive to be as alarmist as possible. The administration and the insurers are now engaged in a lengthy negotiation about what you might call \"The Obamacare Exchange Rescue Package of 2014.\" In response to public outcry, the administration has made a bunch of changes to the rules -- allowing people with \"grandfathered\" plans, for instance, to keep their policies. Those rule changes are going to cost the insurers a considerable sum. So the administration is proposing more rule changes, this time to funnel money to the insurers.\n\nThe insurance industry would like the funnel to be as big as possible. One way to encourage this is to tell reporters that you're planning to triple policy premiums in \"a populous swing state\" -- during an election year.\n\nI'm not saying that they are lying. I'm just saying that when we read these stories, we should always be conscious that these leaks are part of a huge ongoing negotiation to which most of us aren't privy. So we always need to consider the strategic aspect of these sorts of leaks.\n\n4) The administration, and local regulators, are going to train the big guns on any insurer that increases rates too much. They won't necessarily succeed in keeping increases small. Insurers, however, may not get the rate increase they're planning.\n\nAll that said, this is obviously not good news. However strategic these leaks might be, they didn't come out of nowhere. We won't know how serious a threat this is until actual rate increases come out this spring.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg View's editorial board or Bloomberg LP, its owners and investors.\n\nMegan McArdle writes about economics, business and public policy for Bloomberg View.

Additionally, the vast majority of new purchasers were selecting the bronze plan, the cheapest, where co-pays and out-of-pocket expenses were the largest.\n\nNot surprisingly, a recent survey of 700 businesses by consulting firm Mercer LLC indicated that 80 percent already had or were strongly considering raising deductibles, the Daily Caller reported.\n\nHence, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius\u2019s warning shot across the bow in testimony to Congress last week, that consumers could expect an increase in premiums in 2015, but smaller than usual.\n\nWith all the delays, mishaps and changes that Obamacare has endured since its rollout, officials across the country are exasperated. One high-ranking insurance executive from a swing state with a large senior citizen population, requesting anonymity, said that rates would likely triple on his Obamacare exchange, according to The Hill.\n\nA major reason would be the mandatory coverages that insurers must provide to everyone, such as maternity and pediatric services, even if you\u2019re male, over 70, and dislike children. Secondly, the percent of young robust Americans enrolling in the president\u2019s \u201csignature legislation\u201d has fallen well below the original benchmark, leaving the pool top-heavy with elderly and costlier patients.\n\nAnd of the administration\u2019s touted 5 million signups, as the March 31 deadline draws near, no mention of how many enrollees have actually paid their first month\u2019s premium.\n\nAs health industry actuaries begin to crunch the crucial numbers, rest assured, Republicans will be sharpening their messages against a party and a president that promised \u201cto cut the cost of a typical family\u2019s premium by up to $2,500 a year.\u201d","44":"Enrollment in Obamacare is surging as the March 31 deadline to sign up draws closer, but the Obama administration is still not likely to meet its original goal of 7 million people insured under the program.\n\nThe total who have signed up so far is now over 5 million, the program reports on its blog, and the rate at which people are signing up has accelerated, the Christian Science Monitor reports. But the surge probably won\u2019t be enough. About 400,000 people per week are signing up, less than half the number required for enrollment to meet early projections.\n\nThe highest rate of enrollment so far came in December, when 1.8 million people enrolled, the newspaper reports.\n\n\u201cGetting to 7 million would require a considerable surge \u2013 essentially squeezing a December-size tally into just two weeks,\u201d the Christian Science Monitor reports.\n\nThe Obama administration and the Department of Health and Human Services have downplayed the original goal recently. HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said last week that \"success looks like millions of people with affordable health coverage.\"\n\n\n\n","45":"It\u2019s come to this: Lefty groups now offering young people cash prizes to enroll in Obamacare\n\nposted at 1:21 pm on March 19, 2014 by Guy Benson\n\nObamacare is such a glittering success that the president has unilaterally issued dozens of delays, suspensions, postponements and alterations to the law. It\u2019s such a success that the administration continues to exaggerate and lie about its enrollment numbers. It\u2019s such a success that its administrators have quietly expanded waiver eligibility to include virtually anyone who might want one, an acknowledgement that the law is a \u201chardship\u201d unto itself. It\u2019s such a success that Obama and his allies have openly abandoned the top three promises upon which it was sold. It\u2019s such a success that only a small fraction of the previously-uninsured population has chosen to participate in it. And it\u2019s such a success that outside advocacy groups, desperate to boost the paltry share of young, healthy sign-ups, have resorted to stunts and bribery (via John Ekdahl):\n\nWith roughly two weeks left in the open enrollment period for health insurance, some groups are trying to sell Obamacare to young people in terms they might actually understand: music, comedy, and cash. Young Invincibles, a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C. that is focused on the economic issues affecting young adults, launched a sweepstakes last week where it is awarding a cash prize of $1,200 \u2014 enough to potentially cover a year\u2019s worth of health insurance premiums for a young adult \u2014 to people who download their health care app or submit a card in the mail. The contest runs through the fall, but by launching it now, organizers hope young people who download the app can use it to learn more about whether they qualify for financial assistance and where they should go to sign up\u2026.Young people are particularly lagging behind in other groups in signing up. So far, 25% of those who have selected private plans are between the ages of 18 and 34. Administration officials have said repeatedly that they expect young and healthy people to put off signing up for insurance until the last minute. So groups are getting creative with their approach in the final push.\n\nThe administration\u2019s original target for this demographic was close to 40 percent \u2014 an outcome experts projected would be necessary to sustain viable risk pools. That goal, like others that won\u2019t be reached, has since been discarded. The appeal of a $1,200 prize may seem intriguing for cash-strapped young adults, but let\u2019s put that number into proper perspective. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a healthy 30-year-old who is lucky enough to win the sweepstakes and claim the prize. That money, as the Marketwatch story says, is \u201cpotentially\u201d enough to cover your first year\u2019s premiums under Obamacare. Potentially. The real number could be significantly higher. Remember, the president just got through admonishing Latino families to ditch their cable or cell phones in order to scrape together enough money to afford Obamacare coverage \u2014 which he estimated could cost as \u201clittle\u201d as $300 per month, or $3,600 per year. But expenses in that ballpark are precisely what compelled a young, urbanite Obama supporter to confess that he\u2019d decided against obtaining coverage. Avik Roy\u2019s in-depth analysis reveals how young people are likely to suffer the worst under Obamacare \u201crate shock,\u201d even after factoring in taxpayer subsidies. CNN\u2019s research shows that in the country\u2019s largest metropolitan areas, many low-income young people won\u2019t be eligible for any subsidies at all. Which brings us to the second element of Obamacare\u2019s one-two wallet punch: Out-of-pocket costs. CBS News reports:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is turning out to be less than affordable for some consumers. That\u2019s because many of the plans carry huge deductibles, creating potential financial problems for middle-class consumers. Some \u201cbronze\u201d-level plans, the lowest level of coverage, carry deductibles as high as $12,700 per year for a family of four. The average individual deductible for a bronze plan is a whopping $5,081 per year, according to research provided to CBS MoneyWatch from HealthPocket, a technology company that ranks health care plans. What\u2019s worse, that represents an increase of 40 percent from the average deductible for an individually purchased plan before the federal health care overhaul, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nSee, young people? You can win a $1,200 prize by signing up for the privilege of forking over five grand in out-of-pocket medical costs\u2026before the coverage you\u2019d be paying into even kicks in. Yes, there\u2019s always the option to choose a plan with a lower deductible, but you\u2019ll pay higher premiums in return. And what about those cheap \u201ccatastrophic\u201d plans carved out for young consumers under Obamacare\u2019s rules? First off, they\u2019re not much cheaper than the \u201cbronze\u201d level options mentioned above. Then come the steep deductibles. Jim Geraghty ran through official GAO numbers to expose \u201cthe catch\u201d back in January:\n\nThe administration insists most uninsured young people will be able to buy plans for less than $50 per month. Sounds great, right? The GAO offered statistics that show the catch. A non-smoking woman, age 30, buying the plan with the lowest possible premium in the state of Virginia would pay $564 per year, or $47 per month. Affordable! . . . Until you realize the deductible is $7,500. That\u2019s how much she has to pay out of pocket before her insurance pays anything. And that\u2019s a bargain compared to some other states\u2026In Oregon, land of the music-video promotional campaign . . . that 30-year-old, non-smoking woman can get an insurance plan with a premium of just $52 per month! Of course, the deductible is $10,000. In Washington, D.C., it\u2019s $53.50 for a plan with the same $10,000 deductible. In Maryland, she can pay $65 per month for that deductible. In Illinois, $68 per month. In Connecticut, $99 per month. In Maine, that same woman can pay $127 per month to enjoy a $12,000 deductible! In Minnesota, that same woman can pay a monthly premium of just $56.92 with a $15,000 deductible. What a bargain!\n\nClick through for links to all of the supporting data. How \u201caffordable\u201d does any of that sound? And that doesn\u2019t even cover any of the substantial premium hikes industry experts are predicting for next year, which the administration is downplaying, not disputing. So which is more persuasive, Millenials: Your bank accounts, or comedy bits starring multi-millionaire movie stars? Young people can either run some quick math and determine for themselves that the \u201cAffordable\u201d Care Act is nothing of the sort, or they can submit to the allure of Obamacare music video contest entrants like this:\n\n\u201cHey bro, I was totally against paying up to $14,000 in deductibles and premiums for healthcare next year, but then I saw those dancers dressed up as hearts and changed my mind,\u201d said nobody, ever. I\u2019ll leave you with Megan McArdle explaining how young Americans are \u201ckilling Obamacare.\u201d\n\nUPDATE \u2013 A reader with ties to the insurance industry writes in to dispute some of Jim Geragthy\u2019s GAO numbers excerpted above:\n\n\u201cACA plans cannot have higher deductibles than $6,350 per person, and all catastrophic plans that I have seen have a $6,350 deductible with 100% covered thereafter. They are also much more expensive than the figures quoted in that paragraph. Sounds like the premiums quoted are from the 2013 pre-ACA plan versions. \u201c\n\nHe also says that the \u201ccatastrophic plan\u201d premiums he\u2019s seen for, say, a 29-year-old woman in Virginia are closer to $170 per month, as opposed to the lower totals mentioned in the piece. Two points: (1) Obamacare does cap out-of-pocket costs, but that provision has been delayed (surprise!) until 2015 \u2014 likely due to the negative impact those caps are expected to have on premiums. (2) Let\u2019s say those maximums do finally go into effect, and that premiums don\u2019t rise even further (even though they will). Let\u2019s run some math. Add the max deductible ($6,350) to monthly premiums ($170, for argument\u2019s sake), and you\u2019re looking at paying nearly $8,400 for healthcare. Here\u2019s another option: Add the average bronze deductible ($5,100) to the premiums described by the healthy, liberal young man in the blog post linked above ($308\/month). Obamacare tab: Nearly $8,800. \u201cAffordable\u201d?\n\nRelated Posts:","46":"Scandal Sheet\n\nThis article originally appeared on watchdog.org.\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 When it comes to Obamacare sign-ups, Florida is tops among the 34 states with federally run health exchanges.\n\nFor many, that\u2019s cause for celebration.\n\nBut, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 latest enrollment report, it\u2019s also a cause for concern.\n\nOnly 24 percent of Florida\u2019s enrollees are within the coveted 18 year-old to 34-year-old demographic.

Treating it can cost $2,290. Then there's the broken arm: On average $7,700. And people without health insurance get to pay full freight.\n\nOr as U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius put it in a government blog: \"This can be a huge financial blow to young people and families alike.\"\n\nThat is the message the administration hopes will be heard by college-age kids and others who do not have health insurance, but could qualify for federal subsidies to help purchase coverage.

And so the new marketplaces need young people who are cheaper to insure to make up for the higher financial risks posed by others.\n\nBut so far, the administration's target audience of people aged 18 to 34 have not been signing up in such large numbers, a trend that could lead to higher insurance costs down the road if it continues.\n\nMore than 5 million people have enrolled in private health insurance under Obamacare, according to the administration. But the latest breakdown shows the number of younger adults stuck at 25% of the enrollment population, versus the 38% target that the administration laid out before last October's botched rollout.\n\nAdministration officials say younger people could sign up in huge numbers in the final days of the open enrollment period.","50":"There are still 12 days left in Obamacare's open enrollment period, but the insurance industry doesn't need to wait for final enrollment numbers to know that they'll raise prices.\n\nThis article is from the archive of our partner . There are still 12 days left in Obamacare's open enrollment period, but the insurance industry doesn't need to wait for final enrollment numbers to know that they'll raise prices. As a series of anonymous industry sources told The Hill, premiums will \"skyrocket\" in 2015 due to the law's bungled rollout and the low number of 18-to-34 year olds who have signed up. Insurance industry officials emphasized that \"any spikes would be a consequence of delays and changes in ObamaCare\u2019s rollout,\" but that is premature. Until the enrollment period ends and insurance companies assess how sick their customers are \u2014 and how much cost will be absorbed by the government \u2014 it may be too early to promise increased premiums due to Obamacare. The sources The Hill cites were responding to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius saying last week that rates would rise, but not as noticeably as they have in the past. That, anonymous insurance industry official #1 told the si, is \u201cpretty shortsighted because I think everybody knows that the way the exchange has rolled out \u2026 is going to lead to higher costs.\u201d He said his company plans on tripling rates.\n\nThere are several points of consideration that will affect a premium spike. They would vary by region, state, and carrier; areas with sicker, older people are likely to be hit harder, according to insurance officials. States that are doing well in terms of overall enrollment would be less likely to see hikes. At the same time, some companies apparently underpriced their plans last year with the intent of hiking them this year regardless, and others will keep prices low to stay competitive. State insurance departments may also limit how much insurers can raise prices. More importantly, industry officials don't yet have enough information on their new customers. Jay Gruber and David Cutler, health policy experts who assisted with Obamacare, told The Hill they expect prices to rise \u2014 because they always do \u2014 but how much depends on how big insurers think the exchanges will be. Three bits of information will influence their perceptions: How many people have enrolled in their plans and how old are they? How sick (or healthy!) are those enrollees? How much will the risk corridors pay out if the companies has too many sick enrollees? The officials interviewed by The Hill said the industry is \"pessimistic\" when it comes to the surge of enrollments by young people that the administration predicts. Which makes this a little premature, since insurers won't know how many young people have enrolled in plans by March 31 until after March 31.","51":"Health Care: The administration issued new rules last week to spare President Obama more political damage from his phony \"keep your doctor\" promise. But in so doing, they've set in motion another ObamaCare rate shock.\n\nSoon after enrolling in ObamaCare, many people discovered the high cost of believing Obama's promises. Not only were millions required to change plans, but many learned that their \"new-and-improved\" ObamaCare plans forced them to give up their doctors and hospitals, too.\n\nTurns out that insurers \u2014 desperate to keep premiums as low as they could in the face of ObamaCare's costly benefit mandates, taxes and regulations \u2014 set up narrow, sometimes extremely narrow, provider networks to hold down costs.\n\nFor those with serious health problems, this could mean disruptions in care, lack of access to doctors and hospitals, and potentially huge out-of-pocket costs if they ended up out of network.\n\nYet even with these narrow networks, premiums still climbed by double digits in most markets thanks to ObamaCare.\n\nAs this reality sank in, public anger mounted. So in its latest attempt to mend a self-inflicted wound, the administration issued a new set of ObamaCare standards designed to force insurance companies to expand their provider networks.\n\nIn its letter to insurers, HHS said that, starting next year, the agency will require all plans to offer \"reasonable access\" to doctors and hospitals. The letter didn't define what \"reasonable access\" means, but any plan that fails to meet this test won't be available in the federal ObamaCare exchange.\n\nHHS will also require insurers to expand access to \"essential community providers,\" boosting it to 30% next year from 20% this year.\n\nAnd regulators will be looking at other cost-cutting features \u2014 deductibles, co-pays, pre-authorization requirements, etc. \u2014 to decide whether any of them are \"discriminatory\" because they might discourage the sick from signing up.\n\nIn other words, HHS plans to pressure insurers both to restrict their use of cost-sharing tools and expand their provider networks.\n\nThat might temporarily appease patients. But you simply can't mandate more generous health plans without also adding costs.\n\nAnd when you combine these new rules with all of ObamaCare's existing mandates, and add in the fact that not enough young people enrolled, you have a recipe for another major rate shock when millions go to renew their ObamaCare coverage in the fall.\n\nAnd so, the train wreck barrels on.","52":"Rick Moran\n\nAccording to the Hill, many insurance companies are contradicting HHS Secretary Sebelius's rosy predictions about modest increases in Obamacare premiums next year.\n\nSome of the increases will be \"significant.\" How significant? In some states, the increase may be as much as 300%.\n\nThe expected rate hikes will be announced in the coming months amid an intense election year, when control of the Senate is up for grabs. The sticker shock would likely bolster the GOP\u2019s prospects in November and hamper ObamaCare insurance enrollment efforts in 2015.","53":"Obamacare has had its share of troubles over the past year. Only 4.2 million people have signed up so far, well short of the desired 7 million enrollees the administration was hoping for. Of course, now the administration has moved the goalposts to 6 million enrollees. I suppose they don\u2019t live by the maxim under-promise and over-deliver. However, as bad as Obamacare is, more infuriating has been the administration\u2019s public presentation of how Obamacare is doing.\n\nPolitico\u2019s Kyle Cheney investigated how many of these 4.2 million enrollees have actually paid their premiums, and the best guess is that 15-20 percent have not paid a dime. That\u2019s problematic for the future of Obamacare. But even worse, insurance industry officials report that the administration has all of the relevant data. So why are we guessing? And why does Kathleen Sebelius obfuscate when asked about who has paid?\n\nFederal officials say they count sign-ups \u2014 people who select plans on HealthCare.gov or in state exchanges \u2014 because they can\u2019t yet rely on the insurers\u2019 figures. They say the industry reports are not comprehensive, and they change month to month. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you because I don\u2019t know that,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said Wednesday when Republicans asked about the number of paying Obamacare customers during hearings on Capitol Hill. \u201cWe don\u2019t collect it.\u201d She reiterated her contention Thursday, telling lawmakers that she\u2019d provide the information as soon as it\u2019s available.\n\nBut that\u2019s not true according to industry sources:\n\n\u201cThey have a lot more information than they\u2019re letting on,\u201d one industry source said of the Obama administration. \u201cThey have real hard data about the percent that have paid \u2026 If they have not processed those yet and compiled the data, that is a choice they are making. But they have that data now.\u201d\n\nSo there are two explanations. Either this administration is incompetent and can\u2019t figure out how to read spreadsheets. Or worse, they are actively lying by omission to the American public in hopes of making their health care law look better.\n\nWhile the consequences of this disinformation are widely different in effect, it\u2019s difficult to see a difference between this scenario and George W. Bush\u2019s misfire on whether Iraq had WMDs. Either Bush didn\u2019t have accurate intelligence (my belief on the issue) or he misled the public. We now face a similar scenario regarding who has paid for Obamacare premiums, except this time it feels a lot more like a lie than simple ignorance.","54":"Of course they will. We wrote last week:\n\nInsurance companies set premiums based on experience. When they lack experience, as with Obamacare, they make assumptions. One assumption that carriers used in setting 2014 premiums was that a bailout would be available if premiums turn out to be too low. The law establishes \u201crisk corridors\u201d for individual and small group insurance, under which the government will reimburse insurance companies\u2019 losses, up to a point. The risk corridors encourage insurers to quote lower premiums, since they are protected (again, up to a point) by the federal government. But the risk corridor provisions of the act expire in 2016. Even more fundamental is the composition of the risk pool in the Obamacare exchanges. The economics of Obamacare, and therefore the premiums charged by insurers, depend entirely on how healthy or sick the people who enroll in Obamacare turn out to be. The Obama administration made projections on this subject, as did the insurers. I don\u2019t think there is any doubt about the fact that actual enrollments in the exchanges have been disappointing from this standpoint. There are nowhere near as many young, healthy people signing up as will be required to make the system work. This is why the Obama administration has embarrassed itself in trying to recruit young people into the program, with Pajama Boy, Obama\u2019s pathetic \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d interview, Angry Mom, and so on. What this means is that once the insurance companies are able to set premiums based on actual experience, as opposed to rosy projections, those premiums inevitably will rise due to the risk pool being lower-quality than predicted.\n\nToday the Hill headlined, based on information from insurance industry sources: \u201cO-Care premiums to skyrocket.\u201d\n\nHealth industry officials say ObamaCare-related premiums will double in some parts of the country, countering claims recently made by the administration.\n\nWhy will Obamacare premiums rise so much next year? The main reason is the poor composition of the risk pool on the exchanges:\n\n\u201cI think everybody knows that the way the exchange has rolled out \u2026 is going to lead to higher costs,\u201d said one senior insurance executive who requested anonymity. The insurance official, who hails from a populous swing state, said his company expects to triple its rates next year on the ObamaCare exchange.\n\nIt is important to note that, while the increases will be most dramatic in the individual market, employer-sponsored group policies will also become more expensive due to Obamacare\u2019s mandates:\n\nIn Iowa, which hosts the first presidential caucus in the nation and has a competitive Senate race this year, rates are expected to rise 100 percent on the exchange and by double digits on the larger, employer-based market, according to a recent article in the Business Record.\n\nInsurance carriers will announce their 2015 rates over the summer, although, as the Hill notes, some \u201ccould also leak their rates earlier as a political statement.\u201d So the rolling disaster of Obamacare has just begun to plague Democrats running for election in November. Which is why RNC chairman Reince Priebus is predicting that the election will be a \u201ctsunami\u201d for Republicans.","55":"Health industry officials say Obamacare premiums will likely double, and in some cases triple, in certain parts of the country next year, and announcements of rate hikes could come within months, potentially adding to the pressure on Democrats going into the midterm elections.The botched rollout of the federal healthcare program, including its numerous delays and changes, is one of the chief reasons for impending hikes, officials told The Hill, as is the impact on insurers of Obamacare's new fees and regulatory restrictions.\"Everyone knows that the way the exchange has rolled out \u2026 is going to lead to higher costs,\" a senior insurance executive who requested anonymity told The Hill.Another official told The Hill, \"All these major delays on very significant portions of the law are going to change what it's going to cost.\"But the most significant cause of rate increases, officials say, is related to the administration's erroneous projections about the number of young healthy consumers who would enroll.\"Demographics matter a lot because they will help determine whether the health insurance market goes into a death spiral (or requires hefty federal subsidies to keep it from doing so),\" Megan McArdle writes in her column for Bloomberg View.\"Young healthy people, and a lot of them, are needed to keep the market stable and premiums low. As we head into the final few weeks, we have a pretty good idea of how many young healthy people there will be, and the answer is: a whole lot fewer than the healthcare wonks were expecting.\"The Obama administration estimated that roughly 40 percent of Obamacare's enrollees would need to be between the ages of 18 and 35 to keep Obamacare financially solvent and premiums would cover costs.As of March 1, just 25 percent of those enrolled were young people. McArdle cites figures from the Kaiser Family Foundation which indicate that if enrollment remains at that level by the end of March, costs would be 2.45 percent more than premiums. Additionally, even if youth enrollment increased to 33 percent, costs would still be greater than premiums at 1.1 percent.The Obama administration has insisted that the rate of enrollment for the young would accelerate in the final weeks, and has orchestrated a major push to sign up young people before the March 31 deadline.But McArdle points out that even in the unlikely event that \"enrollment is truly massive,\" it still won't be enough.Insurance officials emphasized that rate hikes will vary significantly depending on the region and the carrier, but areas of the country with older, less healthy populations are likely to be affected most.The industry warnings come less than a week after Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius admitted to congressional lawmakers that rates would increase in 2015. She emphasized, however, that growth would be slower than in the past, The Wall Street Journal reported.\"The increases are far less significant than what they were prior to the Affordable Care Act,\" Sebelius said during testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee.One official said he believes Sebelius' comments were a \"pre-emptive strike\" and an attempt to \"soften up the American public\" to the likelihood of premium increases.\"My gut tells me that, for some people, these increases will be significant,\" Bill Hoagland, a former executive at Cigna and senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center, told The Hill. \"That was her way of getting out in front of it.\"Other health industry insiders say it's too soon to assess the accuracy of Sebelius' predictions.\"Health premiums increase every year, so the odds are very good that they will increase next year, as well. None of that is news. The question is whether it will be a lot or a little. That depends in part on how big the insurers think the exchanges will be,\" David Cutler, one of Obamacare's architects, told The Hill.Jon Gruber, who also helped design the new healthcare program, said, \"The bottom line is that we just don't know. Premiums were rising 7 to 10 percent a year before the law. So the question is whether we will see a continuation of that sort of single-digit increase, as Sebelius said, or whether it will be larger.\"The picture is expected to become clearer as insurers begin the process this spring of filing their rate proposals with state insurance commissioners.It is possible that some insurers will continue to hold rates low to remain competitive, though some initially underpriced their policies to attract customers in the first year, expecting to raise rates in the second year, according to The Hill.If the predictions of major rate increases come to fruition, the political fallout for the Democrats \u2014 who will already be under intense pressure in the midterm elections due to the troubled healthcare law \u2014 could be even more significant.Rate hikes would also likely undermine Obamacare enrollment efforts in 2015, The Hill reported.","56":"This site has been blocked by the network administrator.","57":"Skyrockets in flight, but hardly a delight. The Hill reports:\n\nThe expected rate hikes will be announced in the coming months amid an intense election year, when control of the Senate is up for grabs. The sticker shock would likely bolster the GOP\u2019s prospects in November and hamper ObamaCare insurance enrollment efforts in 2015.\n\nThe industry complaints come less than a week after Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius sought to downplay concerns about rising premiums in the healthcare sector. She told lawmakers rates would increase in 2015 but grow more slowly than in the past.\n\n---\n\nThe insurance official, who hails from a populous swing state, said his company expects to triple its rates next year on the ObamaCare exchange.\n\nThe hikes are expected to vary substantially by region, state and carrier.\n\nAreas of the country with older, sicker or smaller populations are likely to be hit hardest, while others might not see substantial increases at all.","58":"ObamaCare hit a milestone Monday, as the Obama administration announced that five million people have now enrolled for health insurance under the law. That\u2019s approaching the six million that the Congressional Budget Office projected would enroll by March 31. But there\u2019s more than meets the eye here.\n\nThe White House still won\u2019t say how many people have paid their premiums (i.e., actually enrolled). It also won\u2019t tell us how many enrollees were previously insured. Millions of Americans saw their health plans cancelled because of the law\u2019s regulations. The law says plans must cover all kinds of \u201ccomprehensive\u201d things, so when a plan changed slightly after the law went into effect, it then had to comply with all of ObamaCare\u2019s regulations \u2013 hence the cancellations. If new enrollments are substantially made up of previously covered but subsequently cancelled people, that\u2019s hardly a success. In fact, it\u2019s often replacing a decent plan with a worse one that costs more.\n\nAccording to one recent survey, one in three uninsured Americans plans to remain that way. That\u2019s in large part thanks to skyrocketing premiums that will double in some parts of the country. The sticker shock is deterring many and causing those who do sign up to choose the bottom-rung \u201cbronze\u201d plans. Folks would rather pay the fine (ahem, the \u201ctax\u201d) of 1% of adjusted gross income and only sign up when they get sick. Who can blame them when the administration keeps delaying any penalties?\n\nThe White House has taken to entertaining, nagging and cajoling the young people ObamaCare must enroll in large numbers in order for it to \u201cwork.\u201d To subsidize the old and sick, the law depends on 40% of enrollees being young and healthy. But only about 25% of enrollees are young and it\u2019s a safe bet they\u2019re not as healthy on average as their age suggests, which means they won\u2019t balance the additional costs of the old and sick.\n\nOne of the core problems with ObamaCare is the designers' arrogance. Congressional Democrats thought that in a nation of more than 300 million people only they were smart and benevolent enough to design a health care law to fit everyone. But it will only work if participation is mandated. It\u2019s hard to think of something more antithetical to the principles upon which the nation was founded. And it\u2019s no wonder it isn\u2019t working.","59":"Health and Human Service Secretary Kathleen Sebelius tried to downplay the expected rise in health insurance premiums last week, telling a House committee that premiums would \u201dgo up at a smaller pace than what we\u2019ve seen since 2010.\u201d\n\nThose comments are already questionable. Obamacare caused the average individual health plan premium to increase by 39% between 2013 and 2014 and the average family plan to increase by 56%, according to data provided last month by eHealthInsurance.com.\n\nThese increases surpass the average of the previous eight years combined, a consequence of the law\u2019s actuarial requirements, taxes and fees, as well as the mandated essential benefits.\n\nFor their part, insurers are disputing Sebelius\u2019 claim, The Hill reports. They\u2019re expecting premiums to rise sharply in some areas of the country, perhaps double or triple, which is partially blamed on the botched rollout of the federal Obamacare exchange:\n\nHealth industry officials say ObamaCare-related premiums will double in some parts of the country, countering claims recently made by the administration.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty shortsighted because I think everybody knows that the way the exchange has rolled out \u2026 is going to lead to higher costs,\u201d said one senior insurance executive who requested anonymity. The insurance official, who hails from a populous swing state, said his company expects to triple its rates next year on the ObamaCare exchange. The hikes are expected to vary substantially by region, state and carrier. Areas of the country with older, sicker or smaller populations are likely to be hit hardest, while others might not see substantial increases at all.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\u201cMy gut tells me that, for some people, these increases will be significant,\u201d said Bill Hoagland, a former executive at Cigna and current senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center. Hoagland said Sebelius was seeking to \u201csoften up the American public\u201d to the likelihood that premiums will rise, despite promises to the contrary.\n\nInsurers are also pointing out that the age demographics are unbalanced, which will also contribute to the rise in insurance premiums, though that\u2019s something that will be determine on a state-by-state bases, since they determine factor expected costs through the lens of individual state exchanges, not one big risk pool.\n\nThere are a couple things to consider after reading this report. First, the ripple effects in the insurance market. Assuming that premium increases do double or triple in some areas of the country, that would likely depress enrollment numbers for the 2015 open enrollment period. Insurers would, once again, readjust with higher premiums. At that point, we\u2019re looking at a death spiral.\n\nThough some have argued that bailout provisions would prevent a death spiral scenario in the transitional period, the fact that insurers are openly warning about very significant premium increases should speak volumes.\n\nRemember, the individual mandate has been effectively gutted for two years. Anyone who doesn\u2019t want to buy insurance could claim a loosely defined \u201chardship exemption\u201d to avoid any tax penalties.\n\nThe other point is the electoral ramifications. Insurers will begin submitting their rates for 2015 in the next two or three months, which state insurance commissioners will have to approve. Though the next open enrollment period has been delayed until after the mid-term election, there will be countless stories about expected premium increases.\n\nThose premium increases will receive a lot of attention in states where there are competitive House and Senate races, and that only serves to bolster Republicans\u2019 chances of taking the upper chamber.","60":"Federal Information & News Dispatch, Inc.\n\nObamaCare, the president's signature domestic policy achievement, turns four at the end of the week. But after so many missed deadlines, delays and unilateral changes to the new law the American people have more cause for confusion than celebration.\n\nHere's a quick look at the growing list of shifts in deadlines and major adjustments to key parts of the law that have left consumers, job creators, and insurance companies, alike, wondering what's actually working with ObamaCare:\n\n\"[In 2013] the president has quietly delayed, modified, or selectively enforced elements of Obamacare more than a dozen times.\" (Obamacare's Year of Delayed Deadlines, Bloomberg , March 13, 2014 )\n\n\"...the Administration quietly excused millions of people from the requirement to purchase health insurance or else pay a tax penalty.\" (ObamaCare's Secret Mandate Exemption, Wall Street Journal , March 12, 2014 )\n\n\"Delays in Obamacare's most destructive requirements are so common -- and so obviously motivated by political considerations -- they aren't even newsworthy anymore.\" (Another ObamaCare Delay, Las Vegas Review -Journal, March 11, 2014 )\n\n\"...a flurry of changes by the Obama administration has led to a frenzied effort among employers, insurance companies, politicians and consumers to try and understand what they might mean.\" (Slew of changes to health-care law creates more confusion for consumers, Washington Post , March 8, 2014 )\n\n\"...more than 37 significant changes already have been made to ObamaCare: at least 20 that President Obama has made unilaterally...\" (37 Changes to ObamaCare...

The suspension of the mandate was buried in an unrelated rule. It casually mentions that a rule in a separate December 2013 bulletin would be extended.\n\nThroughout the catastrophic rollout of Obamacare it has been clear that Mrs. Sebelius was either \u201cout of the loop\u201d in the department of which she was the top executive, or she is just a blatant liar. I, frankly, am unsure which is worse.\n\nThe law became effective on October 1. On October 2 it was clear that the program was not ready for prime time. The Republicans in the House passed several bills to repeal it and then to just postpone the effective date. The White House lectured that this was a law passed by both the House and Senate and signed by the president. It was even ratified by the Supreme Court. It is settled law and cannot be changed.\n\nWhen the stories of cancelled plans rolled out it became clear that this was causing more political pain than could be managed in an election year and the administration decided to change that \u201csettled law\u201d and delay its effective date.\n\nWhat the president castigated the Republicans for trying to do legally, he did without any legal authority. Last week he extended that deadline again which would get the Democrats, conveniently, beyond another election.\n\nIn early February, the president extended the effective date for small businesses for a year. That too has just been extended for two years.\n\nThe most recent delay, which the President so ardently opposed when it was offered as a legitimate legislative proposal, applies, according to Speaker John Boehner, \u201cto virtually anyone for any reason.\u201d\n\nFor all practical purposes Obamacare is no longer.\n\nSecretary Sebelius was also asked in that hearing how many of the 4.2 million \u201cenrollees\u201d she was touting had paid the premium and were thus actually insured.\n\nShe had no idea. She explained that the purchasers pay the insurance company direct to the insurance company and there was no way for the government to know who paid and who didn\u2019t. That simply has to be another lie.\n\nThe entire purpose of this enterprise was to find a way to insure those who were uninsured. There are many pieces to this puzzle. One of the most important pieces is information. I promise you that if 95 percent had paid for their policy she would have happily told the committee\n\nObamacare was undertaken ostensibly because about 45 million Americans did not own health insurance. There were many reasons for that. We were told that up to half of our entire population could have trouble buying insurance because of pre-existing conditions. The Census Bureau puts that number at about 1.5 million. It was known at the time of the debate that a significant number of the uninsured had plenty of money. They just chose not to buy insurance.\n\nSome had jobs that provided coverage and they opted out. I visited a plant in Athens, Ga. and asked the plant manager if they provided insurance coverage. She said that they did, but only about 42 percent of the employees availed themselves of it. They didn\u2019t want to pay their share of the premium and knew that they could go to the emergency room at any time.\n\nTwo of her employees, who were insured, delivered babies in the last year. When they went to the hospital they told the person at the receiving desk that they were uninsured. They didn\u2019t want to pay the co-pay.\n\nToday we are 90 percent of the way through the open enrollment period for Obamacare. A McKinsey study through February concludes that of those signed up about 27 percent were previously uninsured and 13 percent of those had paid the premium. So, 143,000 of the 45 million previously without insurance are now covered.\n\nThank you Mr. Obama!\n\nOf those who were previously insured, but lost their insurance and went through the hassle of getting new insurance, 86 percent paid their premiums.\n\nWe now have 2.4 million newly insured under Obamacare while 4.7 million lost their policies because of the new mandates. That is not success.\n\nSo where does that leave us? We have spent billions of dollars to put one-sixth of our economy under the heavy boot of government. Bureaucrats have reordered what was widely seen as the world\u2019s best health care system, thousands of doctors are leaving their practice and we have 2.3 million fewer people insured than were insured six months ago.\n\nHow\u2019s this working out for you so far?\n\nJohn Linder served in Congress for 18 years from Georgia.

Period.\u201d It was one of the foundational lies of Obamacare, and Obama smugly repeated it on many occasions in a tone suggesting that those who denied it were beyond the pale. The video below collects several iterations of Obama\u2019s lie.\n\nThe lie appeared together with a few other of the foundational lies in Obama\u2019s June 2009 address to the American Medical Association. Before the AMA Obama made \u201ca sweeping pledge\u201d (as the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Mary Lu Carnevale characterized it) that \u201cno matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor. Period. If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan. Period. No one will take it away. No matter what.\u201d\n\nThat was then. Now, of course, it turns out that\u2019s not true, and Obama has conceded as much, in his own inimitable style. Peter Suderman picks up the story here:\n\nAsked in a recent WebMD interview about limited access to doctors under the law, Obama responded, \u201cthese are private insurance plans, which means that they\u2019re going to have networks. That\u2019s pretty much true of any health insurance plan you\u2019ve got right now\u2026that\u2019s not unique to the Affordable Care Act.\u201d What it comes down to, he said, is people making choices. \u201cFor the average person, for many folks who don\u2019t have health insurance initially, they\u2019re going to have to make some choices. They might have to end up switching doctors in part because they\u2019re saving money. But that\u2019s true if your employer suddenly decides this network is going to give you a better deal. \u2018We think this is going to help keep premiums lower. You gotta use this doctor as opposed to this one.\u2019\u201d Well, yes, people in the private health insurance market have to consider tradeoffs and make their own choices, as do employers. But the choices about plans and coverage networks facing many people now have come about as a direct result of Obamacare, which, by design, shook up the market for individual health coverage.\n\nNote the tone of clinical detachment with which Obama walks away from his previous assurance. This is so cold:","63":"Health industry officials say ObamaCare-related premiums will double in some parts of the country, countering claims recently made by the administration.\n\nThe expected rate hikes will be announced in the coming months amid an intense election year, when control of the Senate is up for grabs. The sticker shock would likely bolster the GOP\u2019s prospects in November and hamper ObamaCare insurance enrollment efforts in 2015.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe industry complaints come less than a week after Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius sought to downplay concerns about rising premiums in the healthcare sector. She told lawmakers rates would increase in 2015 but grow more slowly than in the past.\n\n\u201cThe increases are far less significant than what they were prior to the Affordable Care Act,\u201d the secretary said in testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\nHer comment baffled insurance officials, who said it runs counter to the industry\u2019s consensus about next year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty shortsighted because I think everybody knows that the way the exchange has rolled out \u2026 is going to lead to higher costs,\u201d said one senior insurance executive who requested anonymity.\n\nThe insurance official, who hails from a populous swing state, said his company expects to triple its rates next year on the ObamaCare exchange.\n\nThe hikes are expected to vary substantially by region, state and carrier.\n\nAreas of the country with older, sicker or smaller populations are likely to be hit hardest, while others might not see substantial increases at all.\n\nSeveral major companies have been bullish on the healthcare law as a growth opportunity. With investors, especially, the firms downplay the consequences of more older, sicker enrollees in the risk pool.\n\nMuch will depend on how firms are coping with the healthcare law\u2019s raft of new fees and regulatory restrictions, according to another industry official.\n\nSome insurers initially underpriced their policies to begin with, expecting to raise rates in the second year.\n\nOthers, especially in larger states, will continue to hold rates low in order to remain competitive.\n\nAfter this story was published, the administration pointed to some independent analyses that have cast doubt on whether the current mix of enrollees will lead to premium hikes.\n\nObamaCare also includes several programs designed to ease the transition and stave off premium increases. Reinsurance, for example, will send payments to insurers to help shoulder the cost of covering sick patients.\n\nBut insurance officials are quick to emphasize that any spikes would be a consequence of delays and changes in ObamaCare\u2019s rollout.\n\nThey point out that the administration, after a massive public outcry, eased their policies to allow people to keep their old health plans. That kept some healthy people in place, instead of making them jump into the new exchanges.\n\nFederal health officials have also limited the amount of money the government can spend to help insurers cover the cost of new, sick patients.\n\nPerhaps most important, insurers have been disappointed that young people only make up about one-quarter of the enrollees in plans through the insurance exchanges, according to public figures that were released earlier this year. That ratio might change in the weeks ahead because the administration anticipates many more people in their 20s and 30s will sign up close to the March 31 enrollment deadline. Many insurers, however, don\u2019t share that optimism.\n\nThese factors will have the unintended consequence of raising rates, sources said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re exasperated,\u201d said the senior insurance official. \u201cAll of these major delays on very significant portions of the law are going to change what it\u2019s going to cost.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy gut tells me that, for some people, these increases will be significant,\u201d said Bill Hoagland, a former executive at Cigna and current senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n\nHoagland said Sebelius was seeking to \u201csoften up the American public\u201d to the likelihood that premiums will rise, despite promises to the contrary.\n\nRepublicans frequently highlight President Obama\u2019s promise on the campaign trail to enact a healthcare law that would \u201ccut the cost of a typical family\u2019s premium by up to $2,500 a year.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to have to backpedal on that,\u201d said Hoagland, who called Sebelius\u2019s comment a \u201cpre-emptive strike.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was her way of getting out in front of it,\u201d he added.\n\nHHS didn\u2019t comment for this article.\n\nInsurers will begin the process this spring by filing their rate proposals with state officials.\n\nInsurance commissioners will then release the rates sometime this summer, usually when they\u2019re approved. Insurers could also leak their rates earlier as a political statement.\n\nIn some states, commissioners have the authority to deny certain rate increases, which could help prevent the most drastic hikes.\n\nEither way, there will be a slew of bad headlines for the Obama administration just months before the election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty bad timing,\u201d said one insurance official.\n\nOther health experts say predictions about premiums are premature.\n\nDavid Cutler, who has been called an architect of Obama-Care, said, \u201cHealth premiums increase every year, so the odds are very good that they will increase next year as well. None of that is news. The question is whether it will be a lot or a little. That depends in part on how big the insurers think the exchanges will be.\u201d\n\nJon Gruber, who also helped design the Affordable Care Act, said, \u201cThe bottom line is that we just don\u2019t know. Premiums were rising 7 to 10 percent a year before the law. So the question is whether we will see a continuation of that sort of single digit increase, as Sebelius said, or whether it will be larger.\u201d\n\nThe White House and its allies have launched a full-court press to encourage healthy millennials to purchase coverage on the marketplaces.\n\nHHS announced this week that sign-ups have exceeded 5 million, a marked increase since March 1.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jay Carney on Tuesday claimed the administration has picked up the pace considerably, saying months ago reporters would have laughed if he \u201chad said there would be 5 million enrollees by March 18.\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear how many of those enrollees lost their insurance last year because of the law\u2019s mandates. Critics have also raised questions about how the administration is counting people who signed up for insurance plans.\n\nPolitical operatives will be watching premium increases this summer, most notably in states where there are contested Senate races.\n\nIn Iowa, which hosts the first presidential caucus in the nation and has a competitive Senate race this year, rates were expected to rise 100 percent on the exchange and by double digits on the larger, employer-based market, according to a February 2013 article in the Business Record.\n\nSheila Timmons contributed.\n\nThis story has been updated to note that the Business Record article was published in 2013, not 2014.","64":"Federal officials are taking aim at more than a dozen state laws that reined in the activities of so-called \u201cnavigators\u201d \u2014 advocates who are helping consumers negotiate the complexities of Obamacare. Specifically, the Department of Health and Human Services is proposing to clarify exactly what states can and can\u2019t do in their attempts to regulate this little-known but critical aspect of federal health reform.\n\nAs the Center reported in August, 17 states have passed laws that impose additional regulations on the navigators \u2014 typically members of social service organizations and advocacy groups who are funded through the Affordable Care Act to help people sign up for insurance (Louisiana passed a law after publication).\n\nSome state officials have said the navigator laws, which generally create additional state training and licensing requirements, were necessary to protect consumers. Many of the state bills were pushed by insurance agents and brokers, who saw navigators as potentially infringing on their traditional role in the insurance marketplace. But consumer groups argued that some aspects of the state laws were unnecessary and would inhibit navigators from helping people enroll in coverage through the new online federal health marketplaces, known as exchanges.\n\nThe federal law says states may establish their own regulations so long as they don\u2019t prevent navigators from carrying out their duties. But until now, federal officials had declined to clarify what would meet that criterion.\n\nLast week, the health and human services department effectively agreed with some of the consumer groups\u2019 arguments, releasing a proposed rule that singles out a handful of provisions included in the state laws that the department, \u201cconsiders to conflict with or prevent the application\u201d of the federal law. While the rule is not yet final, it may lead to yet another round of legal battles between states and the federal government over the health care law. HHS is currently collecting public comments on the proposal, and will do so until mid- April. It\u2019s not clear when a final rule might emerge.\n\nThe proposed rule says that states may impose their own oversight of navigators, such as requiring fingerprinting or background checks. But it lists several provisions that state laws may not include, such as requiring navigators to refer people to agents or brokers, preventing navigators from helping people who already have insurance that they bought through an agent or broker, or prohibiting navigators from discussing the details or benefits of particular plans.\n\nMost of the state laws contain at least one of these provisions, and it\u2019s unclear what will happen if HHS adopts the rule as final. The rule itself would not immediately invalidate a state law, said Richard Olague, a department spokesman, but would instead provide guidance for states and others on the department\u2019s position. It could also become fuel for lawsuits.\n\n\u201cI think you can expect to see a lot of litigation,\u201d said Wes Bissett, senior counsel for government affairs for the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America. \u201cJust because HHS were to promulgate a rule that says certain state laws are preempted doesn\u2019t make it so.\u201d\n\nBissett said his organization supports some aspects of the proposed rule \u2014 it would also allow the department to fine navigators and would prohibit them from going door-to-door, for example \u2014 but that other provisions may simply tie the hands of state regulators. He pointed to the clause that prevents states from requiring that navigators refer people to agents or brokers.\n\n\u201cIf you have a working relationship with an agent, there may be a benefit to talking to that person before talking to a navigator that doesn\u2019t have that experience,\u201d he said. Bissett said his organization plans to submit comments on the proposed rule.\n\nAfter they were passed last year, the state navigator laws led to at least two lawsuits, brought by unions and community health groups in Missouri and Tennessee who said the laws were overly restrictive. In January, a federal judge enjoined Missouri\u2019s law, saying the state could not choose to regulate navigators if it elected not to run a health care exchange. The federal health law says that navigators are to be regulated by the health exchange of the given state, but 34 states opted not to run their exchanges, and the federal government has run the marketplaces in those states instead, taking oversight duties of navigators as well.\n\nLast summer, navigators were drawn into the larger political battle over the health care law, with a batch of mostly Republican state and federal public officials directing scrutiny at groups that had applied for federal navigator funds.\n\nA report released in January by the George Washington University School of Public Health and Health Services also seemed to indicate that the navigator laws, at least in part, were having an effect on outreach for the law. The report found that community health centers located in the nine states that had both adopted navigator laws and also declined Medicaid expansion, another provision of the health care law, had fewer resources compared to similar groups in other states.\n\nBisset said he has seen little evidence that the navigator laws have hindered application of the reforms, and that they have helped protect consumers with additional oversight.\n\nJust last week, the Kansas state Senate and Arizona House passed their own navigator bills, and similar legislation is pending in Oklahoma. Each would appear to be set up for a collision course with the federal rule if they are passed by the full legislatures.","65":"QUESTION: You started out by saying 5 million people have enrolled.

Without a subsidy, the average individual premium is now $274 a month. Families have been hit even harder with an average increase of 56 percent over the same period \u2014 average premiums are now $663 per family, over $426 last year.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2013, average premiums for individual plans increased 37 percent and average family premiums were upped 31 percent. So they have risen faster under Obamacare than in the previous eight years.\n\nAn important caveat is that eHealth\u2019s prices don\u2019t include subsidies, so the prices for anyone earning between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level will be lower. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has repeatedly claimed patients will pay as little as $18 per month, without noting the taxpayer cost.\n\nPremiums are being hiked across the board for several reasons, but the biggest contributor is the Obama administration\u2019s highly touted \u201cessential health benefits,\u201d services that insurers on and off exchanges must provide.\n\nSome benefits, such as emergency and laboratory services, are uncontroversial. But others, like maternity, newborn and pediatric services, are causing headaches for huge swaths of the population that don\u2019t need them. Anyone past childbearing age, single men, the infertile, even nuns \u2014 their premiums are rising as well, because their plans must, by law, provide more services.\n\nBut premiums aren\u2019t the only key to health care costs \u2014 deductibles and out-of-pocket costs like co-pays are also rising. When it comes to employer health plans alone, four out of five U.S. companies have increased deductibles or are considering doing so.\n\nPrices may be people away from purchasing health insurance. The latest survey from consulting firm McKinsey found that half of those who haven\u2019t purchased health insurance yet this year cited their inability to pay the premium.","68":"WATCH, LEARN AND LISTEN WITH IBD VIDEOS\n\nStay on top of the market with IBD's exclusive videos.

What's more, to save money, most buyers are choosing the lowest level of coverage, the so-called \"bronze\" plans.\n\nThe firm provided the costs to Secrets through their new online price index, which gives the averages of what people are paying for insurance sold through their system. In California , for example, some families are paying a high of $2,604 a month and in New York , $1,845 .\n\nThe shocking surge in prices show what Americans not in Obamacare or covered by their employer are paying as they seek lower premiums. Typically, they are not eligible for the subsidies Obamacare offers those with low incomes.\n\n\"Premiums are increasing primarily because of the new required provisions for 2014 Affordable Care Act compliant plans, including guaranteed issue, essential health benefits, modified community rating and minimum actuarial values,\" said Brian Mast , spokesman for eHealthInsurance. \"It is also likely that health insurance companies expected additional risk in the risk pool, because people with pre- existing conditions could no longer be denied coverage, and may have priced their plans higher to accommodate for this risk,\" said Mast.\n\nHis firm's price index also gives an average age for singles buying plans, and the results are worrying for insurers and the Obama administration. That's because the average age is 36, older than the administration had hoped for.\n\nExplaining the higher costs, Mast said, \"There are likely other factors, but what is important is that moving forward, there needs to be a collective effort to enroll as many people as possible and create a broad and diverse risk pool to keep premiums in check. eHealth can help in that effort by enrolling consumers off-exchange and is pushing to be able to enroll people in subsidy-eligible plans as well.\"\n\nThere is a hint of good news, though, in firm's the price index. While the current costs for insurance are higher than before Obamacare, they have come down over the past several months.\n\nBelow is a cost summary provided by eHealthInsurance:\n\n-- Premiums have increased by 39 percent to 56 percent, compared to pre-Obamacare coverage. As of Feb. 24 , the average premium for an individual health plan selected through eHealth without a subsidy was $274 per month, a 39 percent increase over the average individual premium for pre-Obamacare coverage.\n\n-- The most recent average premium for plans without a subsidy chosen by families was $663 per month, a 56 percent increase over the average family premium in Feb. 2013 , which was $426 per month.\n\n-- For both individual and family applicants, bronze plans have been the most popular plan type chosen since the beginning of open enrollment.\n\n-- Shoppers chose less expensive plans as open enrollment progressed.\n\nCopyright: (c) 2014 ProQuest Information and Learning Company; All Rights Reserved.

One acute problem is the tradeoff between costs and access.\n\nObamacare imposes numerous regulations on insurance policies, requiring that each of them provide a comprehensive set of benefits deemed essential by Washington bureaucrats while at the same time capping deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. These reforms make insurance more expensive, especially for younger and healthier Americans with lower routine medical costs.\n\nResponding to these changes, insurance companies decided to cut costs by driving a harder bargain when negotiating payment rates with doctors, hospitals and other medical providers. Though premiums still are rising for individuals seeking to purchase health insurance, those increases were somewhat contained by insurers' countermoves of paring down their provider networks.\n\nThe problem is that once Obamacare went into effect, Americans throughout the country began to realize that having a new insurance plan that promised lots of new benefits didn't necessarily mean much if those benefits were too hard to access. Last August, Modern Healthcare reported on a McKinsey & Co. analysis of 955 Obamacare plan offerings in 13 states, which found that almost half were of \"the narrow-network type,\" meaning enrollees' choices were restricted and that they would \"have limited or no coverage if they seek care outside their plan network.\" In California , none of the plans offered through the state's exchange covered care at prestigious hospitals such as the UCLA Medical Center and Cedars- Sinai.\n\nIn response, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on Friday issued final guidance to health insurers on the 2015 benefit year, imposing tougher regulations to ensure \"network adequacy.\" Next year, a plan won't be allowed on an Obamacare insurance exchange unless the insurer can offer what CMS considers \"reasonable access\" to doctors and hospitals. At least 30 percent of \"essential community providers\" (who serve predominantly low-income individuals) have to be in all of an insurer's networks, too.\n\nInsurers will be able to meet these regulations -- but at a price. Expanding provider networks without easing regulations elsewhere will drive up costs. So here's the rub for Obama administration regulators: If they force insurers to offer truly broad networks on top of all the other benefit requirements, premiums will skyrocket. But if they put more pressure on insurers to contain the growth of premiums, access will suffer.\n\nThere's an alternative solution: Remove regulations dictating what type of policies insurers must offer and telling Americans what type of insurance they must buy. This would let people decide for themselves whether they want more expensive insurance with more comprehensive benefits and broader access to providers, or cheaper insurance with fewer benefits and more limited access. Allowing consumers to decide how they want to spend their own money should be a no-brainer, but treating people like adults is a radical concept for this nanny-state administration.\n\nCopyright: (c) 2014 ProQuest Information and Learning Company; All Rights Reserved.

Families have been hit even harder with an average increase of 56 percent over the same period \u2014 average premiums are now $663 per family, over $426 last year.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2013, average premiums for individual plans increased 37 percent and average family premiums were upped 31 percent. So they have risen faster under Obamacare than in the previous eight years.\n\nAn important caveat is that eHealth\u2019s prices don\u2019t include subsidies, so the prices for anyone earning between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level will be lower. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has repeatedly claimed patients will pay as little as $18 per month, without noting the taxpayer cost.\n\nPremiums are being hiked across the board for several reasons, but the biggest contributor is the Obama administration\u2019s highly touted \u201cessential health benefits,\u201d services that insurers on and off exchanges must provide.\n\nSome benefits, such as emergency and laboratory services, are uncontroversial. But others, like maternity, newborn and pediatric services, are causing headaches for huge swaths of the population that don\u2019t need them. Anyone past childbearing age, single men, the infertile, even nuns \u2014 their premiums are rising as well, because their plans must, by law, provide more services.\n\nBut premiums aren\u2019t the only key to health care costs \u2014 deductibles and out-of-pocket costs like co-pays are also rising. When it comes to employer health plans alone, four out of five U.S. companies have increased deductibles or are considering doing so. (RELATED: 4 of 5 companies may hike deductibles due to Obamacare)\n\nPrices may be people away from purchasing health insurance.

Some of Obama's campaign donors have lifted it and are driving down K Street with it.\n\nAmericans buying health insurance outside the new Obamacare exchanges are being forced to swallow premiums up to 56 percent higher than before the health law took effect because insurers have jumped the cost to cover all the added features of the new Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn California, for example, some families are paying a high of $2,604 a month and in New York, $1,845.\n\nBelow is a cost summary provided by eHealthInsurance:\n\n\u2014 Premiums have increased by 39 percent to 56 percent, compared to pre-Obamacare coverage. As of Feb. 24, the average premium for an individual health plan selected through eHealth without a subsidy was $274 per month, a 39 percent increase over the average individual premium for pre-Obamacare coverage.","78":"John Q. Public got his pockets picked last weekend by ObamaCare bureaucrats.\n\nIn a sneaky and illegal maneuver after close of business Friday, the Obama administration proposed a new rule increasing bailout protection for insurance companies that sell ObamaCare exchange plans. The rule \u2013using taxpayer money, of course -- is designed to protect the companies from losses.\n\nIt\u2019s illegal, because no president, including Obama, has the constitutional authority to rewrite the laws. The president\u2019s sworn duty is to \u201ctake care that laws are faithfully executed.\u201d\n\n[pullquote]\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, as written and enacted in 2010, contains a bailout provision, Section 1342. It makes insurers whole for losses they were certain to incur by virtue of offering \u201caffordable\u201d plans.\n\nSuch losses were inevitable, because ObamaCare rules make it impossible for an insurance company to offer \u201caffordable\u201d plans and still cover costs. The premiums have to cover a long list of mandatory benefits, as well as $100 billion in taxes that the law imposes on insurers over the decade. Most significantly, the premiums have to cover the cost of caring for seriously ill people for the same price as healthy people.\n\nEvery state that tried this community rating scheme (including New York ) has seen premiums soar as the healthy, unwilling to foot the bill, stop buying insurance.\n\nThe bailout provision was inserted in the law by design to encourage insurers to set premiums too low. That helps the law, and its Democratic backers, look good. It was deception from the start, and a real effort to make a fatally flawed scheme appear as if it is providing affordable health plans.\n\nThe bailout provision went unnoticed until November, 2013, when public outrage over five to six million cancelled plans moved President Obama to make one of his many ad hoc changes to the law.\n\nThe law, as written, forced insurers to cancel policies that didn\u2019t comply with ObamaCare \u2019s one-size-fits-all coverage requirements. But on November 14, the president disregarded his own law and told insurers they could keep selling the non-compliant plans.\n\nThe insurers complained that this sudden change would wind up costing them money. Not to worry, said Obama health official Gary Cohen, who pointed to section 1342 and even promised to sweeten the bailout\u2019s rules to \u201cprovide additional assistance.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when members of Congress decided to read Section 1342.\n\nOutraged House Republicans held a bailout hearing, at which Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius confessed the administration had never tried to estimate what the bailout would cost taxpayers.\n\nSo much for the administration\u2019s frequently repeated false claim that the bailout is \u201crevenue neutral.\u201d\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) proposed repealing the bailout provision, but that went nowhere.\n\nThat is, until Friday, when the administration moved in the opposite direction by lawlessly sweetening the bailout for 2015. The new rules substantially increase permissible profits and the percentages of revenue that insurers can spend on salaries and administration, instead of patient care.\n\nThe motive for these new sweeteners is obvious.\n\nPresident Obama continues to dismantle his own law, hacking off provisions as they become unpopular in order to minimize Democratic losses in the fall elections.\n\nHealth reform be damned.\n\nAmong the latest ad hoc changes are to let people continue to buy their old, non-compliant plans through 2016, and to virtually eliminate the tax on people who fail to get covered.\n\nPopular with John Q. Public, perhaps, until John finds out he has to prop up the insurers who will lose money because of these changes.\n\nBut only through 2016, when the law says the bailouts will end. Conveniently, that\u2019s also when Obama will leave office and insurers will have to face the music.\n\nNo wonder Moody\u2019s, a rating agency, lowered its outlook on the insurance industry from stable to negative, blaming the \u201congoing unstable and evolving environment\u201d as the president mangles and distorts his own law.\n\nSo in 2016, it seems, insurers will get what their due for embracing a scheme that forces the public to buy its product and bail them out to boot. Just desserts.\n\nJohn Q. Public is the real victim. John is forced to throw good money after bad to prop up the president\u2019s unworkable law.\n\nFriday\u2019s sneaky rule announcement is the latest example.\n\nBetsy McCaughey, Ph.D. is chairman of Reduce Infection Deaths and a senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Research.

Diane Black says that the Obama administration\u2019s most recent Obamacare rule change will result in insurance companies keeping more profits while paying less for customers\u2019 health care needs.\n\n\u201cI am writing to express my concern with the proposed rule change released on Friday, March 14th that would allow insurance companies to keep an additional two percent of premiums for purposes other than medical care\u2026your department is now proposing to increase the amount of money that insurance companies will be allowed to retain for profit,\u201d Black wrote in a letter Tuesday to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, which was obtained by The Daily Caller.\n\nHHS\u2019 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services quietly introduced the new rule Friday, which relieves insurance companies of some of the damage about to be levied on them by Obamacare-related administrative costs.\n\n\u201cIn the proposed rules, you have indicated that this adjustment in the \u2018medical loss ratio\u2019, or 80\/20 rule, is due to the possibility of increased administrative costs in 2015. However, adjusting the percentage that insurance providers are required to spend on medical care by two percent would have the combined impact of reducing the amount that insurance providers will be required to pay for people\u2019s medical care while increasing the amount that insurance companies are allowed to retain for profit and for executive pay,\u201d Black wrote.\n\n\u201cThis is deeply concerning, as it could result in higher out of pocket costs for consumers solely for the benefit of the insurance industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this rule were to take effect for 2015, what reasonable expectation can consumers have that it would be reversed in 2016 or later years?\u201d Black wrote.\n\n\u201cAt a time when public approval of the health care law is so low, do you believe that giving insurance companies a greater percentage of American consumers\u2019 money for their profits will negatively impact enrollment? Do you believe it is fair to force Americans through tax penalties to give insurance companies an even greater percentage of their premiums for costs not related to medical care?\u201d Black wrote.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter","80":"This article is from the archive of our partner .\n\nGood news for President Obama: health experts agree that six or seven million is an arbitrary number, and the exchanges have enough people. The bad news is that the numbers matter on a state-level \u2014 and some states aren't doing too well, writes Bruce Japsen at Forbes.\n\nLast week the president told WebMD that he was confident enough people have enrolled in Obamacare to make the system economically sound, though he didn't mention reports that approximately 20 percent of enrollees haven't paid their premiums. (Conservative outlets thought this was a little bold, and Twitchy summed up the backlash with this gem: \"If you like your bogus definition of success, you can keep your bogus definition of success.\")\n\nStill, health experts agree that the important number isn't how many have enrolled nationally, but in each state. \u201cWe would agree with the president, but it\u2019s really on a state-by-state basis,\u201d said benefits consultant Bryce Williams of Towers Watson. \u201cWe don\u2019t even look at the national enrollments. You don\u2019t need to get to 6 to 7 million nationally.\u201d","81":"President Obama's sales pitch for Obamacare included repeated promises that, under his proposal, \"if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. Period.\" But it turns out that, for some people, that's not true.\n\nObama doesn't make much effort to deny this. Instead, he tries to shrug off the blame.\n\nThe gist of Obama\u2019s excuse for why some people can\u2019t keep their doctors under his health care overhaul is that, despite his promise that it\u2019s not really his fault. Don\u2019t blame the president, because it\u2019s all just a natural part of the health insurance marketplace.\n\nAsked in a recent WebMD interview about limited access to doctors under the law, Obama responded, \u201cthese are private insurance plans, which means that they\u2019re going to have networks. That\u2019s pretty much true of any health insurance plan you\u2019ve got right now\u2026that\u2019s not unique to the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nWhat it comes down to, he said, is people making choices.\n\n\u201cFor the average person, for many folks who don\u2019t have health insurance initially, they\u2019re going to have to make some choices. They might have to end up switching doctors in part because they\u2019re saving money. But that\u2019s true if your employer suddenly decides this network is going to give you a better deal. \u2018We think this is going to help keep premiums lower. You gotta use this doctor as opposed to this one.\u2019\u201d\n\nWell, yes, people in the private health insurance market have to consider tradeoffs and make their own choices, as do employers. But the choices about plans and coverage networks facing many people now have come about as a direct result of Obamacare, which, by design, shook up the market for individual health coverage.\n\nThanks to Obamacare, the health plans\u2014and the networks and doctors that went along with them\u2014that millions of people had and liked are no longer available. Those people had made their choices, and then Obama took their choices away, after promising that he wouldn\u2019t. The choice those people have now is a choice that he forced upon them, that many didn\u2019t want, and that he said they wouldn\u2019t have to make. (There's also some indication that the networks for plans in the exchanges have tightened in response to regulations and incentives built into the law.)\n\nMeanwhile, the plan choices offered through the law\u2019s exchanges are, in many cases, rather limited. In 515 mostly rural counties in 15 different states, there\u2019s only one health insurer selling coverage, according to The Wall Street Journal. In the vast majority of those counties, the local Blue Cross & Blue Shield plan is the only option.\n\nObama acknowledges as much, while attempting to frame it as good news. \u201cThe good news\u201d he says, \u201cis, in most states, people have more than one option.\u201d Put another way: This is about choice. But in some places, there isn\u2019t one. The only choices Obama likes are the ones that he allows.","82":"\n\nYou know the drill by now. The Obama administration releases an enrollment figure, the media credulously repeats it, then we bring you the facts. It's becoming something of a ritual around these parts. Let's begin with the spin.

Today: 5M Obamacare enrollees. Needed b\/t now and 3\/31: 1M Obamacare sign-ups to hit CBO projection \u2014 Sarah Kliff (@sarahkliff) March 17, 2014\n\nBack in reality, the generally-accepted estimate of the nationwide non-payment rate is 20 percent -- meaning that one-fifth of the \"newly enrollment\" are not, in fact, enrolled. The administration \"counts\" anyone who's placed an Obamacare exchange plan in their virtual shopping cart as signed up. Kathleen Sebelius again testified last week that HHS is not keeping track of who checks out and pays their first month's premium, which are necessary steps to becoming fully enrolled. (I've included that video below). As of a few weeks ago, payment delinquency rates were close to 50 percent in certain states. Nearly half of the few previously-uninsured Americans who have selected plans through Obamacare are not paid up. Also, the overwhelming majority of these \"new\" enrollees are not obtaining coverage for the first time. Most had insurance prior to Obamacare. According to estimate, fewer than 30 percent of those signing up are first-time enrollees. Two independent studies revealed that roughly 90 percent of eligible consumers who were uninsured before the law's implementation have chosen not to purchase plans on Obamacare's exchanges. The top reason cited was lack of affordability. Here's my back-of-the envelope math about the real progress\n\nWIth 20% nonpayment rate, actual enrollment # is ~4 million -- 57% of the administration's 2013\/2014 goal, w\/ 2 weeks to go. #Math \u2014 Guy Benson (@guypbenson) March 17, 2014\n\nThat's based on the White House's original target of seven million, which they've since tried to pretend never happened. If you take these calculations a step further by only tallying enrollments of (a) newly-insured people who (b) have activated their coverage by paying, the accurate \"new enrollment\" number sits just north of one million. And that's using the relatively generous 20 percent nonpayment rate assumption. Remember, according to the McKinsey study, the delinquency percentage among this group is more than double the broader national one-fifth figure. I'll leave you with Kathleen Sebelius testifying once again that she and her merry band of Obamacare administrators have no idea how many people are actually fully enrolled, or how many of them had coverage before this $2 trillion program took effect:\n\n\n\n","83":"ACA gets 5 million sign-ups \u2014 W.H. talking sports injuries to boost enrollment \u2014 AFP pouring more into anti-ACA ad campaigns\n\nWith help from Natalie Villacorta\n\nOBAMACARE CLEARS 5 MILLION SIGN-UPS \u2014 It\u2019s a milestone that could motivate backers of the law as they seek to maximize enrollment in the last two weeks of March.

Previously they offered trade-ins on a more limited basis online.\n\nIt will also offer refurbished used games in its stores for the first time. Walmart has been seeking new ways to boost revenue as its low-income customers remain under pressure due to a weak jobs picture and shaky economy. In its most recent fourth quarter, net income dropped 21 percent, and the Bentonville, Ark.-based company gave a subdued forecast for the current year.\n\n\"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,\" said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S.\n\nIn a call with journalists, Walmart executives said CE Exchange, the company that partnered with them on their trade-in program for smartphones and tablets launched in the fall, will also be in charge of the new video game program.\n\nThe value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.\n\nAmazon, Target, Best Buy, GameStop and others also offer video game trade-in programs that offer store credit or cash for video games.\n\nHave a question or comment about a news story?

Games of the type are refurbished and sold later.\n\nWhile GameStop would not likely lose market share, it would be forced to enter into a price war to both buy used games and to sell the refurbished games, according to Stifel analyst David Schick.\n\n\"We know that WMT (Walmart) \"invests in price\" ... and we expect GME (Gamestop) will match an increasingly competitive marketplace to protect (market) share,\" Schick wrote in a note to clients.\n\nMicrosoft shares were up 4.3 per cent and analysts at Barclays hiked the stock's price target to $44 from $43.\n\n''Microsoft is arguably the leader in the cloud services market with Windows Azure and Office 365.

Wal-Mart Stores are proposing to owners of old video games, such as Call of Duty, to trade in these games in exchange for store credit - not cash - that can be spent on other items.\n\nThe company is expected to announce on Tuesday that the trade-in program will begin on March 26 in more than 3,100 Wal-Mart stores nationwide, according to the New York Times. The program will become available in Sam's Club stores as well.\n\nNet income of the company recorded in the most recent fourth quarter showed a 21-percent drop, along with a low forecast for 2014. With video game trade-in program, Wal-Mart aims to expand ways for the company to increase revenue as many of their low-income consumers are still navigating the sluggish economy. The retailing giant also said it can fuel sales of new items by giving a new currency to its consumers in the form of their old buys.\n\n\"We see this as an opportunity not only to grow our total market share, but to provide access to customers where they may not have had it before,\" said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of Walmart U.S., in a conference call with journalists.\n\nThe trade-in also signifies a major move by the company into the profitable business of gaming. \"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,\" Mac Naughton also said.\n\nCE Exchange will take charge of this new video game trade-in program of Wal-Mart. It is the same company that partnered with the retailer for their earlier trade-in program for tablets and smartphones.\n\nA report by abcnews.go.com said the value differs for each traded-in video game, as it will depend on the title, age of the game, and console. It can be anywhere from a few dollars to $35 for older games and perhaps much higher amounts for newer ones.\n\nThere are other retailers that offer such trade-ins - whether for store credit or cash - such as Best Buy, Amazon, GameStop, and Target. What differentiates Wal-Mart from the rest is one can use the in-store credit for buying non-gaming items such as food and clothing, said Mac Naughton.\n\nWal-Mart clarified that it will only accept games, not hardware, but provided these games come unscratched and not damaged beyond repair. These games will be refurbished via a third-party company and will be sold later at stores and online labeled with \"certified pre-owned\" on packaging. Expect the availability of a solid inventory of secondhand games this summer.\n\n\u00a9 2017 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

It's a business that's dominated by GameStop Corp., the world's biggest dedicated seller of video games with the largest and most-established video game trade-in program.\n\nRetailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video game trade-in programs.

The value for each trade-in will vary by the title, console and age of the game, ranging from just a few dollars for older games to $35 or more for newer ones.\n\nIn an apparent flight on GameStop's program, Wal-Mart made a point on Tuesday of saying that the credit it will offer shoppers can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.\n\n\"When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins,\" said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of its US stores. \"They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.\"\n\nGameStop did not respond to a query for comment.\n\nInvestors appeared to think Wal-Mart's move spells trouble for GameStop, sending its shares down 3.7 percent to $38.30, while Wal-Mart shares rose 14 cents to $74.82.\n\nBut analysts suggest the new program isn't necessarily a death knell for GameStop. After all, other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with \"modest\" success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian, but GameStop has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.\n\n\"History suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share,\" he wrote in a client note.\n\nThe trade-in business is appealing for a retailer: When a consumer buys a new video game for $60, only a small portion of its sale price goes to the company.

In fact, Wal-Mart tried a video trade-in program from 2009 to 2010 using kiosks in stores, but that was not a success. The company said it has found a better system that will make the process more efficient.\n\nStill, Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia said GameStop has advantages that Wal-Mart does not: a large refurbishment facility in Dallas, pricing algorithms and experience developed over a decade.\n\n\"It makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well,\" Bhatia said. \"However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers.\"\n\nAnother potential challenge in the video game trade-in market is software makers' grudging acceptance of it.

The Walmart news doesn't bode well for brick-and-mortar video game retailers like GameStop.\n\nTracey Andersonre-stocks X-Box sets on opening day of a new Walmart on Georgia Avenue Northwest in Washington in December. Walmart plans to expand its video game trade-in program to its stores, offering store credit for thousands of video games.\n\nIf today's news were played out in a multiplayer video game, GameStop would have just lost one more life at the hands of mega-retailer Walmart.\n\nWalmart announced Tuesday that it will begin buying back used video games next week in exchange for gift cards that can be used on anything in the store. It's potentially a very damaging move for brick-and-mortar video game retailers like GameStop, which depend on game trade-ins for a significant part of their revenue. GameStop stock fell sharply this morning following the announcement.\n\nWalmart's new program will start March 26 at 3,100 locations. Store credit will range from a few dollars for older titles to over $35 for new titles, depending on the condition. Credit can also be redeemed at Sam\u2019s Club, the Wal-Mart-owned membership warehouse chain.\n\nRecommended: CEO vs. worker pay: 10 companies with the biggest gaps\n\n\u201cGaming continues to be an important business for us and we\u2019re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,\u201d said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart US in a release on Walmart's website. \u201cWhen we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They\u2019ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.\u201d\n\nWalmart previously offered a limited video game trade-in system online and tried breaking into this market in the late-2000s with trade-in kiosks at stores. Neither venture was particularly successful.\n\nThis move comes at a time when major discount retailers are struggling to get penny-pinching customers in the door, especially as the economic downturn hit excess spending. Walmart, while still an enormously profitable company, saw its store sales drop 21 percent on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter of 2013.\n\nMeanwhile, the video game announcement is another bit of bad news for GameStop and other brick-and-mortar video game retailers, who are now squeezed on all sides. In January, GameStop\u2019s stock took a tumble on the news that PlayStation would provide online gaming options. Online-accessible games have taken a chunk of retailers' game sales. Rough holiday sales numbers didn\u2019t help, though retailers insisted the transition between consoles was to blame. That seemed to hold true \u2013 overall video game sales were up 9 percent on the year, largely driven by PlayStation 4 and XBox One console sales, according to recent study from the NPD group. Software sales, however, were down 9 percent.\n\nGameStop says about a fourth of its recent revenue has come from used products. Though Target, Best Buy, and others have trade-in programs, GameStop has largely run the show. GameStop\u2019s chief executive Paul Raines says he isn\u2019t intimidated by the new player.\n\n\"We win those market share battles because we've been at it a long time,\" he said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Monday. \"There are lots and lots of risks when you're buying a pre-owned product.\"\n\nMr. Raines is referring to inventory management and staff training, but GameStop has also implemented a customer affinity program and subscription based benefits, in hopes of capturing gamers\u2019 loyalty.\n\nRegardless, the markets haven\u2019t been as confident. In early trading Tuesday, GameStop was down 5 percent. As of 3 p.m., it was down 3.55 percent for the day.","108":"Stocks surged for the second straight day today, making last week's slide a distant memory, as remarks from Russian President Vladimir Putin calmed markets. Putin said he did not wish to seize further parts of Ukraine, but still defied Western protests by formally declaring Crimea as part of Russia. Investors, however, seemed to be glad that the crisis is contained to the peninsular region for now as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) finished up 89 points or 0.6%, and the S&P 500 approached its record high once again, climbing 0.7%.\n\nIn other macroeconomic news, housing data was positive as February housing starts at 909,000 were roughly in line with estimates, but building permits, a leading indicator for the sector, jumped to 1.02 million, well ahead of January's total of 945,000 and better than expectations at 955,000. Data also showed that last month's Consumer Price Index increased 0.1%, indicating that inflation continues to be under control.\n\nLeading the blue chips' gains today was Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which jumped 4%, hitting $39.55, or its highest point since 2000. The jump came on rumors that the software giant would introduce a version of its Office suite. According to Reuters, new CEO Satya Nadella could make the announcement at a March 27 event. Investors reacted well to the news as Office is Microsoft's most profitable product, but the decision could undercut sales of Microsoft's own Surface tablet, which runs on Windows and comes with Office installed. Still, analysts estimate that the Windows-maker is forgoing $2.5 billion a year by not making Office for the iPad. Considering the Surface has undersold expectations, perhaps the iPad strategy is the better direction.\n\nElsewhere on the Dow, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) said it wanted to get into the used video game business. The retail giant said starting March 26 it will allow customers to trade in used video games for credit on purchases at Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores. Wal-Mart said it would refurbish the old games and sell them in \"like-new condition.\" Investors did not have a strong reaction to the news, as used video games are just a $2 billion business, and Wal-Mart's entry is unlikely to be meaningful to its bottom line. Shares moved up just 0.1%, but when the world's largest retailer enters a new business there are bound to be consequences. Shares of GameStop (NYSE:GME), the No. 1 retailer of new and used video games, fell as much as 6% and finished down 3.4% on the news. The effects of Wal-Mart's are unclear, but GameStop benefits from a smaller store format that is often more accessible and staff specialized in video games. Considering Best Buy and Target already offer such programs, I wouldn't expect the move to have an immediate impact on GameStop.","109":"Not Found\n\nThe requested URL \/walmart-looking-dominate-another-field\/3063\/richard-schirmer\/ was not found on this server.\n\nAdditionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.","110":"Walmart will begin selling used video games in stores and online later this year, a move that could prove disruptive to online sellers. The retail giant announced its plans as it readies the launch of a new trade-in program for video games later this month.\n\nStarting March 26, Walmart customers will be able to trade in their video games and apply the value immediately towards the purchase of anything sold at Walmart and Sam's Club, both in stores and online. Walmart wrote on Facebook, \"The trade-in value will vary by title, age and console. Values range from a few dollars for older games to upwards of $35 or more for new releases.\" The company said it would accept thousands of titles for popular consoles like the Sony PlayStation, Nintendo Wii and Microsoft XBOX - games need to be in their original packaging.\n\nLater this year, Walmart customers will also be able to purchase pre-owned video games in stores and on Walmart.com. The video games will be labeled \"Certified Pre-Owned\" which means the product is fully refurbished and in like-new condition.\n\nDuncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., said \"While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we're glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games.\"\n\n\"When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins,\" he said. \"They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.\"\n\nWalmart launched a gadget trade-in program last year. The retailer takes ecommerce seriously and runs Walmart Labs, which has said, \"We're not a retailer competing in Silicon Valley. We're building an internet technology company inside the world's largest retailer.\"\n\nWalmart said there were over 110 million gamers across the U.S. and estimated the pre-owned video game opportunity at $2 billion.","111":"Following a long-term pilot program started in 2009 but not expanded until today's announcement, Walmart has decided there is enough demand for a video game trade-in program in its stores. However, unlike the typical video game trade-in program, Walmart is hoping to leverage its general product selection as a key advantage against GameStop, despite the world's largest retailer never referencing the specialty chain by name.\n\nBeginning on March 26th, Walmart will expand its game trade-in program to 3100 locations across the country, while used game sales are expected to begin later this Summer both in-store and online.\n\nThe expansion will also bring a new \"certified pre-owned\" section to the stores and online for game trade-ins. Ironically, the program goes live today for all Walmart employees before the official public launch, while Walmart will be able to pad out their used game inventory ahead of time.\n\nThe program relies on games from all current platforms and Walmart is boasting to the media that its average credit payout per game will be at least $35, significantly more than GameStop offers for games. Of course, the kicker is that while GameStop's program is limited to buying game-related products in its stores and online portal, Walmart wants the program to drive store and online sales with gift cards loaded with store credit in exchange for games. Oddly, the program currently excludes trade-ins of consoles.\n\nOn one hand, GameStop has to sit up and pay attention to this because it could get enough traction to cut into its trade-in volume, if marketed in the right way. On the other hand, limiting the trade-in program to games with original packaging means that GameStop still has some sort of advantage for older games.\n\nOne thing I'm curious to see is how people will game the trade-in program. Would you trade in your games at Walmart over GameStop or Amazon, or do you use other methods to get rid of games you don't play anymore?

Later this year the retailing giant will start selling pre-owned games.\n\nGameStop's long-running program of accepting trade-in games for cash or in-store credit will be replicated by the nation's largest retail chain. Walmart and Sam's Club will allow customers to trade in games for Sony PlayStation3 and Microsoft Xbox 360 and immediately apply that value to any new purchase both in store or online, the company said.\n\n\"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,\" said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S. \"When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.\"\n\nThose interested in trading in their games will bring them to the store's electronics' department with the original case. An associate will then scan the game's bar code and evaluate the overall condition of the game. The customer will then be offered a trade-in value that can be accepted or denied. If accepted, the amount immediately becomes available to the customer for use in a future purchase.\n\nWalmart said trade-in prices will range up to $35 per game. The program only includes games, not the hardware.\n\nThis program, obviously, will lead to Walmart starting to sell certified pre-owned video games later this year. These will be sold both online and in store. The company promises that these used games will be refurbished and in \"like new\" condition.\n\n\"While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we're glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games,\" added Mac Naughton.\n\nWalmart already accepts trade-ins for tablets and smartphones.\n\nThe importance of the gaming market was clearly made yesterday as the research firm GFK Chart Trak reported that Titanfall from Electronic Arts landed in the top spot on the UK gaming charts. In addition, GFK credited the game with a 96 percent increase in UK Xbox One sales. Of these purchases, 70 percent took place through the TitanFall\/Xbox One bundle that was offered.\n\nTAG Walmart, Playstation 4, Playstation, Xbox, Gamespot\n\n\u00a9 2017 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

It\u2019s a business that\u2019s dominated by GameStop Corp., the world\u2019s biggest dedicated seller of video games with the largest and most-established video game trade-in program.\n\nRetailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video game trade-in programs. But Wal-Mart\u2019s new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which for the last three years has drawn roughly half of its profits from buying and selling used video games.\n\nStarting next week, Wal-Mart customers can trade in video games for credit that can be used in both Wal-Mart and Sam\u2019s Club stores. The value for each trade-in will vary by the title, console and age of the game, ranging from just a few dollars for older games to $35 or more for newer ones.\n\nIn an apparent flight on GameStop\u2019s program, Wal-Mart made a point on Tuesday of saying that the credit it will offer shoppers can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.\n\n\u201cWhen we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins,\u201d said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of its US stores. \u201cThey\u2019ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.\u201d\n\nGameStop did not respond to a query for comment.\n\nInvestors appeared to think Wal-Mart\u2019s move spells trouble for GameStop, sending its shares down 3.7 percent to $38.30, while Wal-Mart shares rose 14 cents to $74.82.\n\nBut analysts suggest the new program isn\u2019t necessarily a death knell for GameStop. After all, other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with \u201cmodest\u201d success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian, but GameStop has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.\n\n\u201cHistory suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share,\u201d he wrote in a client note.\n\nThe trade-in business is appealing for a retailer: When a consumer buys a new video game for $60, only a small portion of its sale price goes to the company. But when a consumer turns around and sells that game back to the company, the company can keep all the profits for itself.\n\nBut it\u2019s also a complex business that requires systems to track and manage used product inventory and pricing and the ability to refurbish products and restock stores appropriately to balance supply and demand. In fact, Wal-Mart tried a video trade-in program from 2009 to 2010 using kiosks in stores, but that was not a success. The company said it has found a better system that will make the process more efficient.\n\nStill, Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia said GameStop has advantages that Wal-Mart does not: a large refurbishment facility in Dallas, pricing algorithms and experience developed over a decade.\n\n\u201cIt makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well,\u201d Bhatia said. \u201cHowever, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers.\u201d\n\nAnother potential challenge in the video game trade-in market is software makers\u2019 grudging acceptance of it. Publishers such as Activision, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive have been adding downloadable content and add-ons to their $60 games to help recover any profits the publishers would have made if the consumer had bought a new game versus a retailer\u2019s $55 used version.\n\n\u201cYou cannot have game and marketing budgets this high while also having used and rental games existing,\u201d Cliff Bleszinski, the creator of the popular \u201cGears of War\u201d franchise, said last year.","122":"The new Walmart to Go convenience store opened recently in Bentonville is not the retailer\u2019s first experiment with the small-store format. Wal-Mart historians and former corporate officers told The City Wire that the first convenience store for the company was located in Springdale in the 1990s.\n\nAlso, the first Walmart Express was built in Flippin, Ark., and catered to campers, fishermen and outdoor enthusiasts visiting Bull Shoals Lake. The original express store featured a few freezers, convenience store fare and a drive-through McDonald\u2019s.\n\nAndy Wilson, a former executive officer for Wal-Mart Stores, said testing new ideas is part of the corporate culture.\n\n\u201cSam\u2019s model was \u2018Try it, fix it, then do it.\u2019 he fostered a learning environment and back then we tried lots of ideas. Of course we were able to keep it quieter than they can today,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThe Wal-Mart culture has a low resistance to change and to stay relevant they are constantly testing and tweaking ideas to align with what customers want.\u201d\n\nOne of the reason\u2019s Wal-Mart abandoned the early test in convenience formats was because the one store in Springdale was located at the entrance to a former Sam\u2019s Club on Thompson Avenue, according to Wal-Mart historians. The largest customer of Sam\u2019s Club during the 1980s and 1990s were small convenience store operators and it was deemed a conflict of interest for the large retailer to compete with its largest customer base. The convenience store was sold in the late 1990s.\n\nIn 2003, Wal-Mart sold its McLane Company division to Berkshire Hathway for $1.45 billion. McLane is a distributor of cigarettes, tobacco and candy to convenience stores and other retail outlets.\n\nWilson said today selling convenience is a big deal to all businesses \u2013 retail and otherwise.\n\n\u201cYou look at what Kum & Go and Casey\u2019s General Stores have done to reinvent the C-store experience and it\u2019s logical that Wal-Mart would try and tweak it\u2019s own version,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nSTORE PLANNING\n\nWalmart to Go is roughly 5,000 square feet and contains around 3,500 SKUs (items), with 14 employees, according to Betsy Harden, Wal-Mart corporate spokeswoman.\n\nHarden said Walmart to Go is not open around the clock, store hours range from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily. Competitor Casey\u2019s General Store located three blocks way is open 24 hours a day. She said there are no other Walmart to Go stores in the pipeline or planned. A former insider has told The City Wire that a second Walmart to Go store is being prepped in Orlando, Fla.\n\nWilson said the merchandising team likely spent a year planning for this one unique format. He said they studied marketing data to determine what products needed to go in store, designed the layout, evaluated competition and worked to reinvent what\u2019s already there.\n\nHe said figuring out operational structure and replenishment and then tying those systems into the supply chain and ramping up efficiencies with the use of technology all goes into the store planning phase.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like building a puzzle, one piece at a time,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cA lot of planning went into this format and when the ribbon is cut on Wednesday (March 19), you can bet the learn and fix it modes will be activated.\u201d\n\nLEARNING LAB\n\nOne of the benefits of having a new format just a stone\u2019s throw away from the corporate offices is the constant study possible within the various retail divisions. Wilson said executives will no doubt frequent the format, study the shopper behavior and learn as much as they can about consumer habits and preferences.\n\nIt can be a price-study lab, given that the products are branded, not private label and smaller portion sizes than what may be available in a supercenter or smaller grocery format. The retailer could also test higher prices \u2013 a trade-off for the convenience factor \u2013 in this small format.\n\nMillennials are a demographic Wal-Mart wants to attract as they are often willing to pay more for convenience. The Walmart to Go offers quick meal solutions, prepared food and fresh fruit, all within a few steps of their car. With major pressure on drug store chains to discontinue tobacco sales, convenience stores could see a bump in volume, although this is declining category overall.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Wal-Mart is keenly aware of what it\u2019s losing in sales to more convenient formats. Let\u2019s face it, it takes time to go to supercenter, it\u2019s a commitment,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWal-Mart is exploring several ways to capture more of the fill-in dollar spend and the convenience format is just one of them.\u201d\n\nHe said Wal-Mart may find some new lessons in this c-store experiment that they may apply to other formats around the globe. Such lessons could drive more sales and reduce overall costs.\n\nComments\n\ncomments","123":"Today, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) announced that it is going to try to bury GameStop's (NYSE:GME) still-warm corpse by accepting used video games for trade-in. GameStop's unique selling point has always been the fact that it is the one big chain where you can go and trade in games, so does this mean that we're watching the end of an era? Probably not.\n\nAs it turns out, a handful of big chains have already tried to get in on the used-game market. Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) have been accepting games for years now, and they've taken very little from GameStop. Analysts have said that they \"do not believe Wal-Mart will have a material impact on GameStop's dominant used video game market share\" and that \"[history] suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share.\" In classic market style, GameStop's stock fell 5% on the news.\n\nWhy GameStop can hold it down\n\nThere are two main reasons that GameStop has been able to defend its moat. First, the company is, ostensibly, staffed with video game fans. When video gamers are looking for someone to talk to, they head to GameStop, where the in-depth discussion never ends. Just kidding: No one talks to employees anymore. What do you think this is, 1950?\n\nThe real reason GameStop can hold off Best Buy is that it generally has a bigger selection of games, and the value you get for trading in doesn't fluctuate enough between the two to drive business to Best Buy. If you're going to get the same amount for your game but you've got a broader selection of things to buy at GameStop, you're probably going to go there.\n\nWal-Mart is likely going to face the same headwinds as Amazon has. Amazon -- a company that competes on price for everything else -- has done, at best, a mediocre job of paying players for used games. Wal-Mart's plan is to take used games for store credit, without selling used games until they build up a collection. So for the first few months, you can walk in, leave your game, get some Wal-Mart credit -- the company won't give cash for games -- and then come back in a few months to buy a different used game.\n\nGameStop isn't out of the woods\n\nJust because Wal-Mart isn't going to crush GameStop doesn't mean that GameStop is fine. The company is still grappling with the increase in digital sales and the fact that the future is going to be all digital. While that time is still a ways off, GameStop needs to have a plan in place ahead of time. The good news is, if you believe that GameStop will get its act together -- I'm still on the fence -- today's fall would offer you a nice discount to get into GameStop. On the other hand, if you think it's all on its way to pear-shaped, maybe now is the time to cash out on those old Sonic games.","124":"-\n\nListen To The Story Marketplace Embed Code <iframe src=\"http:\/\/www.marketplace.org\/2014\/03\/18\/business\/why-wal-mart-will-buy-your-used-video-game\/popout\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"240px\"><\/iframe>\n\nThe market for used video games is in the neighborhood of $2 billion. It's way beyond folks selling on Craigslist. Big global retailers, like GameStop, make massive profits selling used games. The gaming retailer's profit margin on used products is nearly 50 percent, far more than it makes selling new games and consoles.\n\nNow the largest retailer of all, Wal-Mart, is getting into the market. It's offering store credit for old games, which it'll eventually refurbish and sell.\n\nOther big retailers have tried and failed to shake GameStop\u2019s hold on the lucrative used gaming market. Wal-Mart brings substantial market power and a formidable advertising budget to the table. But even if it doesn't beat GameStop, offering trade-ins will get more people inside Wal-Mart. The retailer is betting gamers will buy other things after they trade in their used games.\n\nSelling used video games may be great for some retailers, but game makers are left out of the profits on the secondary market. Some have made moves to try to stifle the used game market or at least elbow in on the profits. But gaming companies have consistently backed down when gamers have pushed back.","125":"The page may no longer be available or the address has changed.

Now, Wal-Mart Stores wants to take them off your hands.\n\nThe country\u2019s largest retailer will begin buying used video games next Wednesday, March 26, with hopes of opening used game bazaars in all of its stores at some point later this year. Wal-Mart has become increasingly interested in the used electronics trade. It buys various mobile devices through its website and allows customers to exchange them at stores for credit toward the purchase of new ones.\n\nUsed game sales in the U.S. totaled $1.6 billion last year, up 3 percent from the year before, according to industry research group NPD\u2014and they will likely grow even more this year. Sales of the new consoles from Microsoft and Sony have been better than expected, so there are even more outmoded games than usual. What\u2019s more, sales of used gaming products have increased when new consoles come out, GameStop said in a recent earnings call, because they become a better value.\n\nGameStop is certainly at risk of being undercut. Margins on used video games are much better than they are for new ones. Used game products accounted for 27 percent of GameStop\u2019s revenue last year, for instance, but 44 percent of its gross profit. These margins matter less to Wal-Mart, which could easily afford to pay more when it buys used games or charge less when it sells them. GameStop\u2019s stock has dropped about 1.5 percent since the announcement.\n\nThe most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Wal-Mart may undersell its new used-game rival but seems less likely to outbid it, if the used phone trade is any indication. Companies such as Gazelle, whose primary business is the used electronics trade, have generally offered slightly more for phones than Wal-Mart or the Apple Store. Gazelle and company also pay in cash rather than in store credit restricted to the purchase of new mobile devices.\n\nWal-Mart\u2019s policy on used games is looser than on phone trade-ins. It pays in the form of gift cards with no restriction that the money be spent on other gaming products. So Wal-Mart has a chance to profit twice every time someone walks in with a used game: once when it resells that game and again when that person uses the gift card. If you want cash, you\u2019ll have to go elsewhere.\n\nOf course, to Wal-Mart customers the U.S. dollar holds no particular appeal, says spokeswoman Sarah McKinney. \u201cWe think a Wal-Mart gift card pretty much is cash,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can buy milk with it\u2014or you can buy a new PS4.\u201d","129":"Walmart to start offering in-store credit for used games\n\n? Comments | NEWS |\n\nBig box retailer Walmart has announced that on March 26 it will begin accepting trade-ins of used video games for store credit that will allow customers to purchase anything in the store. Over 3,100 Walmart locations will participate in the program, though Sam's Club and neighborhood market locations will be unable to accept used games. That said, this credit will be usable at any Walmart location, and will even allow customers to purchase items online.\n\nWhat's significant about this trade-in program is that it doesn't just apply to games. What that means is that although Walmart might not have as large a selection of games as Gamestop, it's still likely to take a fair chunk out of that retailer's bottom line, particularly if it offers customers a better deal for their old titles.\n\nVia Polygon\n\n?

That could be very bad news for GameStop (NYSE:GME) as it struggles with declining sales for traditional games despite the release of a new generation of gaming consoles.\n\nWhat is Wal-Mart doing?\n\nStarting March 26, Wal-Mart customers will be able to trade in their video games for immediate store credit both in Wal-Mart locations and Sam's Club stores, as well as on the company's website. The traded-in games will then be refurbished and made available for purchase in what a Wal-Mart press release called \"like-new condition at a great low price.\"\n\n\"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,\" said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart U.S. \"When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.\"\n\nWhy is Wal-Mart moving into used games?\n\n\"For Wal-Mart, like most major retailers, it's about about driving more customers into the store and boosting revenue,\" Bruce Horovitz wrote for USA Today . \"Retailers like Wal-Mart and McDonald's that more widely appeal to lower-income customers have faced a tough time battling back from the economic downturn. These customers face bleaker employment prospects and many don't have extra money to spend.\"\n\nOffering credit for used games is not only a way to get these customers into stores, it also lets Wal-Mart shake the last few dollars from their pockets.\n\nHow healthy is GameStop?\n\nWhile GameStop has had a tough go of it in recent years, its results for the third quarter of 2013 were surprisingly solid. The company has not reported on its full-year 2013 results yet.\n\nTotal global sales for the third quarter of 2013 were $2.11 billion compared to $1.77 billion in the prior year quarter, an increase of 18.8%, the company reported. Consolidated comparable store sales rose 20.5%, well above the forecasted range. GameStop's net earnings for the third quarter were $68.6 million, a 45.3% increase compared to adjusted net income of $47.2 million in the prior year quarter.\n\n\"Our strong third quarter sales results give us great momentum as we enter the new console cycle,\" CEO Paul Raines said in the earnings release.\n\nHoliday sales were strong too as the company reported total global sales for the period were $3.15 billion, a 9.3% increase compared to the 2012 holiday sales period.\n\n\"Comparable store sales were driven by new video game console sales as demonstrated by the 99.8% increase in new hardware sales,\" the company said in a press release.\n\nWill Wal-Mart's move hurt GameStop?\n\nNo company wants to see a giant like Wal-Mart move into its territory and announce that the company expects to force prices down. New game prices are generally consistent across all retailers, but the used market can vary greatly. Wal-Mart can hurt GameStop in two areas -- what it pays customers for used games and what it charges for refurbished games.\n\nGross margins on resale of pre-owned games \"are expected to range from 46% to 49% for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year,\" GameStop reported. That leaves a lot of room for Wal-Mart to to pay more for games and\/or lower prices and still make money while squeezing GameStop.\n\nHow important is the used market to GameStop?\n\nGameStop earned $2.4 billion of its roughly $9 billion in total revenue in 2012 from the used market, according to the company's most recent annual report; 70% of trades were applied to the purchase of new product. Over 12 million games were refurbished by the company, along with over 1 million hardware units.\n\nThe company also forecast in its 2012 annual report that market for used games would stay strong.\n\nBased on reports published by the NPD Group, we believe that, as of December 2012, the installed base of video game hardware systems in the United States, based on original sales, totaled over 294 million units of handheld and console video game systems and grew by 19 million units in 2012. According to IDG, the installed base of hardware systems as of December 2012 in Europe was approximately 187 million units and grew by 14 million units in 2012. Hardware manufacturers and third-party software publishers have produced a wide variety of software titles for each of these hardware platforms. Based on internal company estimates, we believe that the installed base of video game software units in the United States currently exceeds 2.3 billion units.\n\nGamestop also cited how it intended to continue to grow its used games sales and stated how important they were for the company.\n\nPre-owned video game products generate significantly higher gross margins than new video game products. Our strategy consists of increasing consumer awareness of the benefits of trading in and buying pre-owned video game products at our stores through increased marketing activities and the use of both broad and targeted marketing to our PowerUp Rewards and international loyalty program members.\n\nTarget, Amazon.com, and Best Buy also compete in the used video game space.\n\nWal-Mart's move is bad for GameStop\n\nIt's hard to picture a worse scenario for GameStop. Wal-Mart is entering the used video game market not primarily to increase revenue but to increase traffic in its stores. A company that large getting involved may grow the overall used game market but Wal-Mart will gain share, some of which will come from GameStop.\n\nThis should drive prices paid for used games up and the cost of those games at resale down. That may be bad for GameStop but it's very good news for gaming consumers.","133":"NEW YORK \u2014 Wal-Mart plans to start buying used video games from shoppers at stores in a move that goes after the bread-and-butter business of GameStop.\n\nWal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to expand its current online trade-in program by allowing customers to trade their used video games at 3,100 Wal-Mart stores in exchange for credit toward the purchase of other items.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest retailer is taking aim at the $2 billion used video-game market.

The value for each trade-in will vary by the title, console and age of the game, ranging from just a few dollars for older games to $35 or more for newer ones.\n\nIn an apparent flight on GameStop\u2019s program, Wal-Mart made a point on Tuesday of saying that the credit it will offer shoppers can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.\n\n\u201cWhen we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins,\u201d said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of its US stores. \u201cThey\u2019ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.\u201d\n\nGameStop did not respond to a query for comment.\n\nInvestors appeared to think Wal-Mart\u2019s move spells trouble for GameStop, sending its shares down 3.7 percent to $38.30, while Wal-Mart shares rose 14 cents to $74.82.\n\nBut analysts suggest the new program isn\u2019t necessarily a death knell for GameStop. After all, other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with \u201cmodest\u201d success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian, but GameStop has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.\n\n\u201cHistory suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share,\u201d he wrote in a client note.\n\nThe trade-in business is appealing for a retailer: When a consumer buys a new video game for $60, only a small portion of its sale price goes to the company. But when a consumer turns around and sells that game back to the company, the company can keep all the profits for itself.\n\nBut it\u2019s also a complex business that requires systems to track and manage used product inventory and pricing and the ability to refurbish products and restock stores appropriately to balance supply and demand. In fact, Wal-Mart tried a video trade-in program from 2009 to 2010 using kiosks in stores, but that was not a success. The company said it has found a better system that will make the process more efficient.\n\nStill, Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia said GameStop has advantages that Wal-Mart does not: a large refurbishment facility in Dallas, pricing algorithms and experience developed over a decade.\n\n\u201cIt makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well,\u201d Bhatia said. \u201cHowever, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers.\u201d\n\nAnother potential challenge in the video game trade-in market is software makers\u2019 grudging acceptance of it. Publishers such as Activision, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive have been adding downloadable content and add-ons to their $60 games to help recover any profits the publishers would have made if the consumer had bought a new game versus a retailer\u2019s $55 used version.\n\n\u201cYou cannot have game and marketing budgets this high while also having used and rental games existing,\u201d Cliff Bleszinski, the creator of the popular \u201cGears of War\u201d franchise, said last year\n\nMore National articles \u00bb","134":"BENTONVILLE, Ark., 2014-3-18 \u2014 \/EPR Retail News\/ \u2014 Walmart is giving the more than 110 million gamers across the U.S. a new way to unlock value in their current purchases and save even more when it comes to one of the fastest-growing forms of entertainment.\n\nStarting Wednesday, March 26, customers will be able to trade in their video games and apply the value immediately towards the purchase of anything sold at Walmart and Sam\u2019s Club, both in stores and online.

And now, they want a piece of that sweet pre-owned games pie that GameStop controls almost exclusively.\n\nBeginning March 26, shoppers will be able to trade-in their used games at any Walmart or Sam\u2019s Club store. Instead of cash, the retailer will offer a Walmart\/Sam\u2019s Club gift card in exchange for the games. The gift card won\u2019t be limited to games and can be used on anything in the store or on the Walmart\/Sam\u2019s Club website. To be eligible for Walmart\u2019s trade-in program, the games must be in playable condition and in their original box. And a Walmart employee will check them for \u201cobvious damage such as deep scratches or cracks\u201d before trade-in credit will be issued.\n\nSo what does Walmart plan to do with all these used games? After the company takes possession of your games, they will be shipped off to a central processing facility where they will be resurfaced and repackaged. Afterwards, they will be sold in Walmart stores as \u201cCertified Pre-Owned\u201d titles. The process appears to be very similar to how Best Buy currently handles used games.","136":"Sorry, the page you're looking for cannot be found.\n\nThe page may have moved, you may have mistyped the address, or followed a bad link.\n\nVisit our homepage, or search for whatever you were looking for\u2026","137":"A market dominated by GameStop is about to see another huge entrant as Walmart is set to launch a used video game purchasing program next week across its nationwide network of 3,100 retail stores.

The value for each trade-in will vary by the title, console and age of the game, ranging from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.\n\nThe world's largest retailer is taking aim at a very lucrative area of the $2 billion used video-game market.

In its fiscal year that ended February 2, 2013, used-game products accounted for $2.4 billion in global sales for GameStop, more than 27 percent of the retailer's total sales. The big draw with used games are, of course, higher profit margins because the retailer gets to keep 100 percent of the trade-in sale. GameStop's used business represented over 44 percent of the retailers gross profit in the fiscal year.\n\nNews of Walmart planning to enter the used-games business led to GameStop shares dropping five percent.","143":"Walmart Announces Video Game Trade-In Program\n\nStarts next week\n\nWith the controversy of the Xbox One\u2019s initial DRM policies, many were worried that the used game market would die off in the near future, especially with digital downloads becoming so prominent and more potential options in the future like PlayStation Now. However, another competitor has jumped into the video game trade-in market.\n\nWalmart has announced their own trade-in program akin to those seen at stores like Gamestop, Best Buy, and Target. Walmart\u2019s program will be more similar to the latter two as you can only receive Walmart gift cards, but can do the trades online.

Specifically, \"used products represented nearly a quarter of its $2.1 billion in sales and more than 44% of gross profit in the quarter ended Nov. 2,\" The Wall Street Journal reported.

But that they have bigger reach and more customers than GameStop, which mean they could make more money.\n\nOf course, it's not just the re-sales of old games where Walmart will clean up.

Not only is it facing growing competition from its own suppliers, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony (NYSE:SNE), but soon it will have to take on the world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT).\n\nWhile Wal-Mart has been selling video games (both hardware and software) for years, the discount chain is about to challenge GameStop in an entirely new way: Later this month, Wal-Mart will begin dealing in used video games. While I wouldn't expect Wal-Mart's new initiative to obliterate GameStop's business overnight, it's only increasing the pressure on a retailer that's becoming less relevant by the day.\n\nThe looming threat of digital distribution\n\nGameStop is one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the S&P 500, with a short float near 30%. While different investors may be working from different theses, the larger case against GameStop primarily centers around the promise of digital distribution.\n\nIt's no secret that the video game industry is going digital. Like movies and music before them, video games are increasingly shifting from physical discs to digital downloads. Owners of Microsoft's and Sony's latest consoles, the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, can, if they so desire, deal exclusively in digital -- downloading all of their games directly from the companies' respective digital storefronts, something that couldn't be done with prior machines.\n\nBut there are still many reasons that gamers would prefer to own a physical copy, and so physical games live on for the time being. Some gamers lack the robust broadband connections required for large game downloads, while others may prefer to have a physical copy that they could sell or lend to a friend. These obstacles cannot be overlooked, but should be overcome in time.\n\nFor their part, both Microsoft and Sony are working hard to encourage gamers to embrace digital distribution. Microsoft has begun to offer aggressive discounts on digital versions of its games, a strategy that allowed Valve to dominate the PC gaming space. Sony has similar \"flash\" sales, but has taken it a step further.\n\nThis summer, Sony's \"PlayStation Now\" service will roll out to owners of its PlayStation 4 video game console, allowing them to stream digital versions of games directly over the Internet. It remains to be seen if the service will be successful, but if it catches on, it will pose an obvious threat, particularly if Sony can expand PlayStation Now to include newer titles.\n\nWhile most sell-side analysts continue to downplay the threat posed by digital distribution, some of them have begun to come around. Last month, Longbow Research downgraded GameStop to underperform, citing the risks posed by digital distribution.\n\nWal-Mart comes after GameStop's core market\n\nWith its suppliers in open rebellion, GameStop's problems are about to intensify. Whatever market remains for used video games in the coming years, GameStop will have to share it with Wal-Mart. GameStop has a number of advantages over Wal-Mart -- a smaller, more focused operation; more knowledgeable employees; and its PowerUp Rewards program -- but Wal-Mart has advantages of its own.\n\nNamely, Wal-Mart plans to offer traders general store credit -- meaning that a pile of old video games could be traded for a cart of groceries, a tank of gas, a new TV, or any of the tens of thousands of items Wal-Mart stocks. In contrast, video games traded in to GameStop can only become more games, video game-related hardware, or used mobile devices. (Admittedly, GameStop will pay cash, but far less than what it pays in credit.)\n\nGiven that used video game products account for about one-quarter of GameStop's revenue and almost half of its profit, Wal-Mart's entrance into the space cannot be discounted. Either GameStop will lose market share or it will be forced to work harder to retain its market, sacrificing margins in the process.","163":"Photo: Reuters\n\nWal-Mart Stores Inc.

Comcast recently unveiled a mobile app that lets customers schedule service appointments.\n\n\n\nCustomer service is expected to be a key focal point of the government's regulatory review of Comcast's purchase of Time Warner Cable, which would give the combined company control over some 30 percent of the pay-television market.Comcast has the lowest customer-service rating of any Internet service provider, while Time Warner Cable ranks last among pay-TV operators, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index A report issued last month by market researcher Temken Group found that providers of TV and Internet services were the most likely to disappoint customers.\"Comcast's customer experience can be described as the worst of the worst,\" said Bruce Temken, managing partner with the firm, in an email. \"Its Internet and TV service businesses are ranked 261st out of 268 companies in the 2014 Temkin Experience Ratings. That places Comcast at the bottom of the TV services industry, which has the lowest-scoring customer experience across the 19 industries we examined.\"Comcast also has lowest-ranked customer service among Internet service providers, Temken said, noting that the company's service scores had its sharpest drop over the last year.Sixteen percent of consumers reported having a bad experience with Comcast in the past six months, according to the research firm. Time Warner Cable fared even worse, with 25 percent of customers reporting a bad experience.\n\n\"We believe it's pure lip-service and nothing more,\" said Chris Marron, deputy editor at the Consumerist blog, in an email about Comcast's pledge to improve customer service. \"If anything, a combined Comcast\/Time Warner Cable would have even less motivation to provide good customer service because there would be significantly fewer options for consumers to choose from for cable or broadband.\"\n\nComcast, the nation's largest cable company, has long argued that the Time Warner Cable merger wouldn't diminish customer choice because the companies don't directly compete. Comcast also says that its internal metrics show that service is improving. More customers are managing their accounts online, and fewer service technicians need to make repeat visits to customers because they are resolving problems the first time, the company says.\n\n\"Our goal is to transform the customer-service experience,\" according to a company spokesperson, adding \"we are not there yet.\"\n\nDespite such efforts, critics have long questioned how serious Comcast can be about improving customer service since it outsources some of its call-center operations to the Philippines. Comcast notes that most of its customers-service team members work in the U.S. and that it has been bolstering these operations.\n\nThe company's critics are unmoved by Comcast's pledge to do better by its customers.\n\n\"If you live in an area served by Comcast, chances are you can only get your cable service through Comcast,\" Marron said. \"You can get satellite service, but satellite does not yet provide quality broadband at an affordable rate.\"","174":"The New York Post reports today that New York Gov.

Primarily, we\u2019re all worried that it\u2019s going to create a giant controlling cable monopoly, controlling all means of communication, including cable and Internet services. In a monopoly scenario, Comcast could potentially charge whatever it wants. The Justice Department is already going to investigate those fears \u2013 that\u2019s its job for any major merger \u2013 but now some U.S. states are joining in.\n\nAccording to a report from Reuters on Wednesday, Florida has teamed up with other unnamed states that will determine how the deal will affect residents. \u201cWe are part of a multi-state group reviewing the proposed transaction along with the U.S. DOJ Antitrust Division,\u201d Florida\u2019s attorney general said in a message obtained by Reuters.\n\nIndiana and Pennsylvania have both confirmed investigations, though Pennsylvania said it\u2019s doing so solo while Indiana only said it\u2019s examining how such a merger will affect Indiana residents \u2013 the state did not say whether or not it was part of Florida\u2019s team. Reuters said Florida and its multi-state investigation team are more concerned on the impact on broadband Internet access, as opposed to cable.\n\nAs Reuters explains, the states alone probably won\u2019t be able to block the merger, but they can provide additional data to the Justice Department and to the Federal Communications Commission, both of which need to greenlight the deal before it\u2019s official. Typically, it\u2019s best for everyone with more competitors in the market.

Comcast has said it also supports the FCC's effort to reinstate the anti-discrimination and anti-blocking rules using existing 706 authority over the timely rollout of broadband to the public.\n\nFranken is concerned that those conditions expire in 2018 and what will happen after that, especially if Comcast and TWC merger.\n\nMost observers expect the FCC to extend the conditions on Comcast beyond that date as a condition of the deal, which would then extend to the TWC systems, or alternately have new rules in place.\n\n\"The Comcast Time Warner Cable transaction will bring millions more Americans under the Open Internet rules as soon as our deal closes,\" said Sena Fitzmaurice, VP of government communications for Comcast. \"We fully expect that the FCC will have in place Open Internet rules that will apply to all companies by the time our current condition from the NBCUniversal deal expires in 2018.

Its customer satisfaction is incredibly low, ranking second to last behind only Comcast in a survey taken last year. Its customer service is routinely criticized and it tied with AT&T for the worst customer service in another survey earlier this year. Its proposed merger is incredibly unpopular, with only 6% of consumers approving of the deal. This bad reputation is beginning to hurt TWC, too, as it lost 825,000 pay TV subscribers last year.\n\nTo improve its image, Time Warner is taking a page from Apple\u2019s playbook and has been renovating its retail stores.\n\nAccording to Market Watch, Comcast\u2019s flagship Manhattan store now has wood floors and quartz countertops. Large tables allow customers to play with product demos. There is also an area for customers to customize what kind of cable, Internet and phone services they want. Employees are now allowed to roam about the store to help customers, instead of being tied to specific desks. There are even classes that customers can take to learn more about Time Warner\u2019s products.\n\n\u201cThis channel needs to be awakened,\u201d said Blaine Altaffer, Time Warner\u2019s retail VP. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to be a DMV experience.

In fact, according to Blaine Altaffer, the renovated flagship store is exceeding the company\u2019s expectations. Average wait times have dropped from 20 minutes to 4 minutes, and Altaffer says the store is seeing more traffic and selling more devices.\n\nTime Warner is now planning to roll out these renovations to more of its stores.\n\n\u201cRetail is our primary sales channel,\u201d Altaffer said. \u201cThere are people who come in and we were not giving them a shot.

Al Franken (D-MN) today asked the Department of Justice to examine network neutrality implications of the Comcast\/Time Warner Cable merger and the increased power the merger would give Comcast when it comes to negotiating paid peering agreements like the recent one with Netflix. Further Reading How the US could block the Comcast\/Time Warner Cable merger \"I am very concerned that Comcast could use its clout in the broadband market to dictate the content consumers receive and the prices they pay, and these concerns are only intensified by Comcast\u2019s proposal to acquire Time Warner Cable,\" Franken wrote in a letter to the DOJ. \"With more than 20 million customers, Comcast already is the nation\u2019s dominant Internet service provider, controlling about a quarter of the national broadband market and a much higher percentage of the market in many of the local areas in which it operates. By acquiring Time Warner Cable, Comcast would extend its reach substantially, covering millions of additional customers. This would give Comcast even more leverage to manipulate Internet traffic to serve its own corporate interests.\"\n\nComcast is not allowed to block or discriminate against Web traffic as a result of conditions on its acquisition of NBCUniversal, but Franken noted that \"Comcast\u2019s net neutrality obligations expire in January 2018, which raises the question of what happens after that time.\"\n\nFranken noted that prior to the NBCUniversal acquisition, Comcast was admonished by the FCC for degrading traffic. That FCC order came in 2008 and sanctioned Comcast for \"secretly degrading peer-to-peer applications.\"\n\nFranken also wants to make peering an issue in the merger review. While big network operators have traditionally engaged in \"settlement-free peering,\" exchanging traffic without payment, consumer ISPs like Comcast have begun demanding payments from Netflix and Netflix's traffic providers. Comcast has won payments both from Level 3 and Netflix, and it's still in a battle with Cogent, one of the companies Netflix pays to distribute its traffic across the Internet.\n\nUS regulators have generally treated net neutrality as a concern only over the \"last mile\" of networks, the connections between consumer ISPs and their residential and business customers. Franken thinks peering and net neutrality should be treated as one issue:\n\nNet neutrality protects consumers by prohibiting broadband service providers, such as Comcast and Time Warner Cable, from picking and choosing which lawful Internet content will reach homes and offices across the country. Settlement-free peering arrangements perform much the same purpose, allowing Internet traffic to flow freely among backbone and last-mile networks without interference from the corporations that control the infrastructure. Because of net neutrality and settlement-free peering, the website for a small hardware store in rural Minnesota loads as quickly as the website for a big, national chain; Vikings fans can read about their team on the website of their choice, whether that\u2019s ESPN or a blog written by a local fan; and an e-mail from a constituent in Duluth gets to me as quickly as an e-mail from my bank. Without open Internet protections, Comcast, Time Warner Cable, and other broadband service providers could block, degrade, or charge extra fees to transmit Internet traffic.\n\nThe merger will be reviewed by both the FCC and DOJ. In other news today, Reuters reported that states including Florida, Indiana, and Pennsylvania will join federal regulators in reviewing the acquisition on antitrust grounds.\n\nIn response to Franken's comments, Comcast made the following statement: \u201cThe Comcast Time Warner Cable transaction will bring millions more Americans under the Open Internet rules as soon as our deal closes. We fully expect that the FCC will have in place Open Internet rules that will apply to all companies by the time our current condition from the NBCUniversal deal expires in 2018.

Last month, he expressed \"serious reservations\" about the proposed acquisition. Today he's gone a step further and sent a letter to the Department of Justice that implores federal regulators to carefully weigh net neutrality and the internet's \"balance of power\" as they scrutinize the purchase.\n\n\"The Internet has been a platform for innovation and economic growth since its inception,\" Franken says. \"It also has connected Americans in unprecedented ways, facilitating the free exchange of information and ideas. Simply put, the Internet belongs to the people, not to huge corporations.\" In other words, the internet is a utility. Franken has asked the Justice Department to include \"a thorough evaluation of open internet issues\" in its pending analysis of the deal. His full remarks can be found below.\n\nUpdate: Comcast has provided The Verge with a statement highlighting the Open Internet rules that the company will abide by until 2018. Further, Comcast says it expects the FCC to implement similar rules that will apply to all major internet providers by the time its current deal \u2014 which came as part of its NBCUniversal acquisition \u2014 expires. We've included Comcast's statement below Senator Franken's.\n\nI am concerned that Comcast\u2019s proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable could compromise the open nature of the Internet, which is one of the reasons I oppose the deal. I am writing to request that you to take this important issue into account when you evaluate the proposal\u2019s anticompetitive effects.\n\nThe Internet is an open marketplace where everyone can participate on equal footing, regardless of one\u2019s wealth or influence \u2013 and I believe that\u2019s the way it should be. The Internet has been a platform for innovation and economic growth since its inception. It also has connected Americans in unprecedented ways, facilitating the free exchange of information and ideas. Simply put, the Internet belongs to the people, not to huge corporations. Comcast\u2019s proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable could disrupt this balance of power, resulting in higher costs and fewer choices for consumers.\n\nNet neutrality protects consumers by prohibiting broadband service providers, such as Comcast and Time Warner Cable, from picking and choosing which lawful Internet content will reach homes and offices across the country. Settlement-free peering arrangements perform much the same purpose, allowing Internet traffic to flow freely among backbone and last-mile networks without interference from the corporations that control the infrastructure.\n\nBecause of net neutrality and settlement-free peering, the website for a small hardware store in rural Minnesota loads as quickly as the website for a big, national chain; Vikings fans can read about their team on the website of their choice, whether that\u2019s ESPN or a blog written by a local fan; and an email from a constituent in Duluth gets to me as quickly as an email from my bank. Without open Internet protections, Comcast, Time Warner Cable, and other broadband service providers could block, degrade, or charge extra fees to transmit Internet traffic. As I wrote in a 2010 letter to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), absent sufficient protections, \"Comcast is free to use its control of its high speed Internet service to block or impede content that it finds in any way competitive with its own content.\"\n\nWhen Comcast acquired NBC Universal in 2011, the FCC echoed my concerns, stating that \"Comcast will have the incentive and ability to hinder competition from other [online video distributors] . . . through a variety of anticompetitive strategies,\" including \"blocking, degrading, or otherwise violating open Internet principles with respect to the delivery of unaffiliated online video to Comcast broadband subscribers.\" In fact, Comcast previously had been caught doing just that, resulting in an FCC order concluding that \"Comcast\u2019s conduct poses a substantial threat to both the open character and efficient operation of the Internet, and is not reasonable.\" The FCC also questioned Comcast\u2019s veracity during the proceedings, concluding that \"Comcast\u2019s claim that it has always disclosed its network management practices to its customers is simply untrue.\" More recent reports indicate that Comcast has begun to change its relationships with backbone networks or popular content providers who need access to Comcast\u2019s millions of customers.\n\nWhile widespread practices of this nature might benefit Comcast\u2019s bottom line, they could be very harmful to consumers and small businesses. To address some of these concerns, the FCC required Comcast to abide by net neutrality rules as a condition of Comcast\u2019s acquisition of NBC Universal. Comcast now touts those net neutrality conditions as a reason to support the corporation\u2019s bid to acquire Time Warner Cable. For example, in a recent memorandum, Comcast\u2019s Executive Vice President wrote that the \"Open Internet protections will be extended to millions of additional broadband customers\" as a result of Comcast\u2019s proposed acquisition and that \"the new company\u2019s broadband consumers will enjoy the enforceable protections of the no blocking and non-discrimination rules that were put in place by the FCC.\" He reiterated this point in at least one recent interview with the media, and I expect Comcast to make a similar case to the Justice Department.\n\nComcast\u2019s statements tell only part of the story, however. First, Comcast\u2019s net neutrality obligations expire in January 2018, which raises the question of what happens after that time. Second, the FCC\u2019s net neutrality conditions do not extend to peering arrangements.\n\nI am very concerned that Comcast could use its clout in the broadband market to dictate the content consumers receive and the prices they pay, and these concerns are only intensified by Comcast\u2019s proposal to acquire Time Warner Cable. With more than 20 million customers, Comcast already is the nation\u2019s dominant Internet service provider, controlling about a quarter of the national broadband market and a much higher percentage of the market in many of the local areas in which it operates. By acquiring Time Warner Cable, Comcast would extend its reach substantially, covering millions of additional customers. This would give Comcast even more leverage to manipulate Internet traffic to serve its own corporate interests.\n\nI therefore request that you include a thorough evaluation of open Internet issues in your analysis of Comcast\u2019s proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable.

At the end of 2013 Comcast had 21.7 million subscribers, Time Warner had 11.4 million, Charter claimed 4.3 million, and Cablevision had 2.8 million. The proposed merger of Comcast and Time Warner will create a behemoth with more than 34 million subscribers.\n\nIn 2013, Comcast lost 305,000 subscribers, Time Warner lost a whopping 825,000, Charter lost 121,000, and Cablevision lost 80,000. None of the nine largest cable operators gained subscribers over the 12 months.\n\nWhere are these cable viewers going? To AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ), where the companies added a combined 1.46 million subscribers in 2013 and to the satellite providers DirecTV (NASDAQ: DTV) and Dish Network Corp. (NASDAQ: DISH) which combined to add 170,000 subscribers over the year.\n\nAT&T had 5.46 million subscribers to its U-verse broadband offering at the end of 2013 and Verizon had 5.26 million subscribers to its FiOS broadband product. DirecTV claimed 20.3 million subscribers at the end of 2013 and and Dish Network claimed 14.1 million.\n\nAccording to LRG, cable providers now claim 52% of the pay TV market compared with 58% just three years ago. Comcast and Time Warner don\u2019t fear any of their cable competitors, but the growth of broadband subscriptions does threaten what\u2019s left of their monopoly markets. Getting bigger is their solution. We\u2019ll have to see how that works out \u2014 if it works out.","190":"Friday, 10 Feb 2017 | 6:36 AM ET\n\nFacebook is being increasingly viewed by U.S. citizens as a news outlet in its own right, according to a survey published this week \u00bb Read More","191":"Comcast has business motivations to follow the Obama administration's now-defunct net neutrality rules, according to CEO Brian Roberts.\n\nComcast, which announced its plans last month to merge with Time Warner Cable in a deal that would combine the country's biggest cable companies, will continue to treat all Internet traffic the same, the company's CEO said in an interview with USA Today.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Getting broadband connectivity to our customers ... means you want to have the best experience,\" Roberts said, adding that consumers don't want their Internet providers to block or slow access to certain websites.\n\n\"I think the ship has long ago sailed in terms of charging companies for [a] high speed fast lane.\"\n\nRoberts said his company will work with the Federal Communications Commission as it attempts to rewrite its net neutrality rules, which kept Internet providers from blocking or slowing access to certain websites and was struck down by a federal court earlier this year.\n\n\"Having some clarity ... is helpful to give our customers confidence, to give Wall Street the confidence\" to invest in the company, he said.\n\nThe company's investors want to ensure that Comcast's base of Internet subscribers continues to grow, he said. \"It's the first thing our Wall Street investors will ask us.\"\n\nOutside of business reasons to treat all Internet traffic the same, Comcast committed to practicing net neutrality when it purchased NBC Universal in 2011.\n\n\"The merger doesn't change some of the net neutrality conversations,\" Roberts told USA Today.\n\nThose commitments will extend to Time Warner Cable customers if the merger is approved by federal regulators, Roberts said when he announced the deal last month.\n\nRoberts pushed back on reports of Comcast's recent deal with Netflix.

She said that element does not get a lot of attention from the advocacy groups, \"but I think is incredibly important for economic growth and development and jobs.\"\n\n\n\nShe said that the deal is neither horizontal concentration nor vertical acquisition: \"It's an expansion of a footprint.\"\n\n\n\nComcast has even promised not to expand that footprint beyond the FCC's former 30% nation cap on subs, even though the courts have thrown out that cap.\n\n\n\nShe said that expansion presents a \"very limited set of issues,\" while at the same time presenting a lot of benefits for consumers in that expanded footprint--Time Warner Cable subs.\n\n\n\nTo that point, she said, Comcast's innovations in speed and services will be extended to those TWC broadband customers \"over time.\" On the video side, she extolled the virtues of Comcast's X1 content access platform. She also talked about Comcast's \"deep bench\" of video available that can extend to TWC's footprint.\n\n\n\nIn sum, she said, there will be benefits without a reduction in competition. \"There will be no fewer services or competitors that will be available. In fact, it probably will increase competition. She said those who have suggested there will be no incentive to upgrade and invest in improving the companies are being proven wrong.\n\n\n\nFree State Foundation president Randolph May pointed out that similar language was being used to criticize the Comcast\/TWC merger and its feared dominance of the Internet and video marketplace were leveled at the Time Warner\/AOL merger, which hardly became the 800-pound gorilla in broadband.","196":"Never miss a great news story!\n\nGet instant notifications from Economic Times\n\nAllowNot now\n\nYou can switch off notifications anytime using browser settings.","197":"\n\nInternet U.S. States to Help DOJ Assess Comcast's TWC Acquisition\n\n-\n\nPrint Recipient E-mail Sender E-mail So far, Florida is the only confirmed state that is helping the DOJ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to\n\n\n\nSo far, Florida is the only confirmed state that is helping the DOJ.\n\n\n\n\"We are part of a multistate group reviewing the proposed transaction along with the U.S. DOJ (Justice Department) Antitrust Division,\" said the Florida state attorney general's office.\n\n\n\nThe states are reportedly more interested in the broadband aspect of the deal rather than cable.\n\n\n\n\n\n[SOURCE: Fortune]\n\nComcast\n\n\n\nBut the acquisition has been met with strong criticism.

In the first, a class claimedthat Warner Cable's $11 billion deal to broadcast Dodgers and Lakers games was passed on to subscribers.\n\nCustomers in a second lawsuittook legal action after the cable company dropped Showtime and CBS from its lineup, as part of a bitter dispute over fees.\n\nThe latest lawsuit alleges that Los Angeles unsuccessfully tried to resolve its dispute with the cable company out of court.\n\n\"The city of Los Angeles enabled Time Warner to make billions and in turn they shortchanged the taxpayers millions,\" City Attorney Mike Feuer said in statement. \"This is the day where we stand up and say enough is enough.\"\n\nTime Warner's franchise has let it lay network cables beneath city streets and on telephone poles.\n\n\"These franchise fees, though insignificant as a percentage of TWC's Los Angeles-generated revenue, are important to the city's general fund, representing dollars which can be expended on core services such as police and fire protection, sanitation, and the operation of the city's parks, senior centers, and libraries,\" the lawsuit states, abbreviating Time Warner Cable.\n\nTime Warner likewise avoided an agreement to provide nonmonetary support to public access studios for city residents, the city alleges.\n\nLos Angeles calls the franchise fee and commitment to public programming \"modest\" and a \"small price to pay for the enormous financial benefits accruing to Time Warner from its control over the city-wide cable market.\"\n\nIt says Time Warner refused in 2008 and 2011 to pay more than $5 million in fees.\n\n\"Not coincidentally,\" Time Warner's stance coincided with the enactment of a California law that encouraged competition from other pay TV service providers, like AT&T and Verizon, the lawsuit claims.\n\nThat legislation required Time Warner to support new public access studios, the city adds.\n\nLos Angeles also filed suitin 2008 after Time Warner acquired the bankrupt business, Adelphia cable systems.\n\n\"The acquisition had resulted in TWC obtaining control over more than 90 percent of the customers in the Los Angeles cable television market, but had also been accompanied by allegations of unexpected rate hikes and severe disruption in the continuity and quality of service, among other wrongful consumer practices,\" the complaint states.\n\nTime Warner allegedly ducked its obligations to the city by arguing that it had never agreed to provide the bulk of support for public access studios. But the city contends that the cable company's refusal is grounded in its increased obligations to support public access studios under California law.\n\n\"Perhaps not by coincidence, TWC's precipitous and wrongful withholding of the franchise fee occurred less than eight weeks before the end of Los Angeles' 2010 - 2011 fiscal year, exacerbating the city's well-publicized fiscal crisis, and further reducing the city's ability to pay for its already diminished core services,\" the complaint states.\n\nLos Angeles demands Time Warner Cable pay $9.6 million in fees, including $2.5 million for the 2008 and 2009 franchise fees, as wells as public, governmental, and educational fees. The same fees allegedly totaled $7.1 in 2010 and 2011.\n\nTime Warner's actions violate the Digital Infrastructure and Video Competition Act of 2006, the California Public Utilities Code and the False Claims Act, the city alleges.\n\nThe company defended its conduct \"as a major job creator, tax contributor and service provider in the city of Los Angeles.\"\n\n\"We are disappointed the city has chosen to bring this action, which we strongly believe is without merit,\" Time Warner said in a statement.\n\nNamed defendants are Time Warner Cable; Time Warner Cable Pacific West; Time Warner Cable Enterprises; Time Warner NY Cable; TW NY Cable Holding; and Time Warner Entertainment Advance\/Newhouse Partnership.","201":"It\u2019s not just the federal government that will scrutinze Comcast\u2019s proposed merger with Time Warner.

Comcast reports quarterly earnings on Tuesday, Jan. 28, 2014.(AP Photo\/Gene J. Puskar)\n\nNet income in the three months through December rose 26 percent to $1.91 billion, or 72 cents per share, from $1.52 billion, or 56 cents per share a year ago. However, the increase was partly due to a one-time tax windfall of $158 million.\n\nExcluding the tax gain, earnings per share came to 66 cents, slightly below the 68 cents per share expected by analysts polled by FactSet.\n\nRevenue rose 6 percent to $16.93 billion, beating the $16.65 billion expected by analysts.\n\nPhiladelphia-based Comcast is rolling out its X1 platform to new customers who sign up for at least three services - Internet, video and voice - and to other top customers where it has supplies. The set-top box allows users to navigate a slick interface like a website which can be controlled through mobile device apps and gives access to more content delivered via the Web. For the upcoming Winter Olympics from Sochi, for example, Comcast is bringing the breadth of NBC's live online coverage to big screen TVs for the first time through the X1 platform.\n\nThe company is likely to caution against too much optimism for a turnaround in video, however.\n\nCable operators have been losing market share to rival telecoms and satellite competitors for years, and fourth-quarter results are generally boosted by college students re-hooking up TVs as they start school and by higher TV use during cold winter months. For the full year, Comcast still lost 305,000 video customers to end the year with 21.7 million.\n\nIt added 379,000 Internet customers to finish the year with 20.7 million.\n\nOverall cable revenue rose 5 percent to $10.66 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\nNBCUniversal posted a 7 percent gain in revenue to $6.46 billion, helped by bigger audiences for broadcast network NBC, which has been bolstered by hits \"The Voice,\" ''The Blacklist\" and \"Sunday Night Football\" from the NFL.\n\nThe company also said it is boosting its share buyback authorization to $7.5 billion - up from $1.5 billion authorized currently - with $3 billion to be spent in 2014. It raised its quarterly dividend by 15 percent to 22.5 cents per share.","218":"Los Angeles Sues Time Warner Cable\n\nTime Warner Cable is on the verge of merging with Comcast, but as the contractual paperwork begins to take effect, the cable company has to deal with another legal matter of the courtroom variety. The Los Angeles City Attorney\u2019s office announced March 14 it filed a lawsuit against Time Warner seeking nearly $10 million.\n\nAccording to a statement released by City Attorney Mike Feuer, Time Warner has allegedly refused to pay fees to the municipality despite \u201craking in billions of dollars of revenue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe City of Los Angeles enabled Time Warner to make billions and in turn they shortchanged the taxpayers millions,\u201d Feuer stated.\n\nSpecifically, the lawsuit seeks $9,697,896 from Time Warner, including more than $2.5 million in fees owed for 2008 and 2009, plus nearly $7.2 million for 2010 and 2011.\n\nThe money allegedly owed is for franchise Public, Educational, and Government (PEG) fees.\n\n\u201cTime Warner Cable \u2026 has derived billions of dollars from its cable television franchise in the City of Los Angeles, yet stubbornly continues to flout its statutory obligations to compensate the City of Los Angeles \u2026 fully for this privilege,\u201d the opening salvo of the 24-page complaint alleges.\n\nCity attorneys made two contentions to support its allegations against Time Warner.\n\n\u201cTime Warner enjoys a virtual monopoly for the provision of cable television services to the residents of the City, and it has blatantly refused to live up to its obligations to the City resulting from the grant of that effective monopoly,\u201d the complaint asserted.\n\nThe funds City Hall alleges have not been paid by Time Warner could have been used to pay for \u201ccore services,\u201d such as fire and police protection, sanitation services, and operation of libraries, parks, and senior centers, the complaint continued.\n\nSince 1986, City Hall has authorized \u201clocal cable franchises\u201d divided into geographic segments within city limits.\n\n\u201cThe Cable Act (and California law) permitted the City to require an operator to assume certain obligations in return for the non-exclusive right to occupy valuable public property \u2013 the rights-of-way \u2013 to build a system to provide cable,\u201d the complaint stated.\n\nIn exchange for the \u201cright to occupy valuable public property,\u201d City Hall was authorized under the Cable Act (also known as the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984) to collect a franchise fee equal to five percent of the operator\u2019s gross revenues.\n\nThe Act also allowed a city could enforce requirements for PEG facilities and equipment.\n\nCity Hall issued 12 local franchises to Time Warner, according to the complaint.\n\nThe complaint details City Hall\u2019s relationship with Time Warner and how that relationship may have changed in light of new state legislation and a law enforcement action filed in 2008 by Los Angeles against the cable provided and alleging deceptive, fraudulent, and unfair practices.\n\nMike Dundas, a deputy city attorney, will oversee the litigation.","219":"The article you are looking for could not be found (error 404).

While this is true, it\u2019s not all bad news for customers.\n\nSince the announcement of Comcast's planned acquisition of Time Warner Cable (TWC) most observers argue that the union will lead to increased monopoly power and (so goes the logical argument) even higher cable subscription fees for consumers. While I agree with much of what is being said about the market power of cable operators in the U.S., I disagree with the statement that acquiring TWC will increase Comcast's market power over consumers in particular, and thus lead to higher subscription fees.\n\nFirst, the two cable operators do not have overlapping networks so they are de facto monopolies as it is. In the case of TWC, I believe that prices might even come down. TWC is a pure operator so when it buys content (generally provided by another monopolist), there is double marginalisation that leads to higher prices than what a cartel would provide (yes, there is no mistake: a cartel providing complementary products prices lower than two independent complementary providers).\n\nComcast owning a lot of content may prevent this. Another concern is precisely Comcast's vast content assets. Given Comcast's increased clout due to the acquisition, it can now extract more surplus from other content providers or lock them out of its offering altogether, substituting its own content in the bundle. This may happen but neither of these strategies is likely to lead to higher subscription fees for consumers. It would simply mean less profit to other content providers.\n\nNow, are high subscription fees a problem? The answer is a resounding yes! But they are not caused by mergers between cable operators. Rather, the issue is that there is not enough competition across network types. This may change if telecom companies, DBS operators and Google develop alternative infrastructure. However, an enlightened regulator may not like this, as this may lead to excess infrastructure investment. Another approach would be to regulate part of the offering. This is already the case to some extent, but the approach needs an update. A good solution could be to regulate broadband access fees over cable. This could keep video prices in check and force cable companies to provide reasonably priced content bundles to consumers.\n\nMiklos's blog\n\nFollow INSEAD Knowledge on Twitter and Facebook","226":"Iranian student group, academics speak out on immigration ban\n\nBy Max Datner \/ For The Pitt News 2 days ago\n\nSetareh Sarachi stood in a crowd huddled under the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy tent in Schenley Plaza Thursday afternoon, surrounded by protesters guarding their signs against the swirling winter weather.

As content costs have gone upwards however, with Pandora claiming that the royalty rates it pays performers via SoundExchange have increased 53 percent in the last five years, Pandora has announced that its subscription model is undergoing some changes. The main focal point of these changes is that Pandora One will go up in price, costing listeners $4.99 per month, or $1 more per month. The change is not set to take effect until May of this year, and customers can even lock in the current price on a new loyalty program if they subscribe before the change is implemented.\n\nIt is worth noting that the annual subscription option for Pandora One is ending, forcing subscribers of the service to pay monthly. The advertisement laden version of Pandora will still be available for free for listeners who chose to not subscribe to Pandora One.","229":"Pandora , one of our favorite streaming music services , announced today they would raise the monthly price for Pandora One to $4.99\/month (from $3.99\/mo) for new subscribers, and that they would eliminate their annual subscription option entirely.\n\nPandora announced the changes in a blog post this morning. Here's the major takeaway:\n\nIn order to continue to provide an ad-free listening option, we are implementing some changes to the way we price Pandora One, including a modest price increase for new Pandora One subscriptions: Existing Pandora One monthly subscribers that remain active will not experience a price increase at this time and will continue to pay $3.99 per month.\n\nFor new subscribers, the subscription price will change to $4.99 per month starting in May.\n\nExisting annual subscribers that remain active will migrate to a discounted loyalty price of $3.99 per month at their next renewal period.\n\nWe are ending the annual subscription option.\n\nBeginning this week, annual subscribers approaching their renewal date will be notified as the update is applied to their subscription. Monthly pricing for new subscribers will take effect in May, allowing time for new subscribers to take advantage of discounted loyalty pricing if they subscribe before then.\n\nSo current subscribers will get to hold on to $3.99\/mo and new subscribers will have to pay the $4.99\/mo price starting in May. If you've been holding off on Pandora One, now's a good time to get in on it and lock in the lower monthly rate. Anyone paying annually for Pandora One will get a price hike though. Pandora One used to be $36\/yr, but the \"discounted loyalty price\" still represents a price hike to about $48\/year.\n\nPandora says the changes will impact only a small number of its listeners, and blames higher royalty rates and payments to record labels and industry agencies for the price increase.

The price for the subscription has been $3.99 but it will be going up to $4.99. To keep users from getting too upset, the company grandfathered existing active subscribers into the already-set price of $3.99. The incoming subscribers will have to cough up an extra dollar a month when it goes up to $4.99 in May.\n\nIn a blog post on the Pandora blog, the company elaborated upon the changes and justified the price increase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We've been fortunate to be able to offer Pandora One at an affordable price since its debut in 2009 at $36 per year and later with the introduction of a monthly subscription for only $3.99 per month,\" the Pandora blog post said. \"Over this same period, the costs of delivering this service have grown considerably.

Let us know what you think in the comments section located down below.","231":"Streaming music biz Pandora will raise the price of its One subscription service, blaming a jump in royalties it has to pay out to record labels.\n\nThe company on Wednesday said that it will raise the cost of its online service from $3.99 per month to $4.99 for new users. Pandora said that current users will not be subject to the price hike for the time being.\n\nThe increase, it's claimed, is a reflection of rising licensing costs Pandora must pay labels for streaming their tracks over the internet. The company said that a content licensing deal it maintains with royalty collection firm SoundExchange has seen prices escalate by 53 per cent over the last five years. Additionally, Pandora claims that SoundExchange will raise rates another nine per cent by the end of next year.\n\nAs such, Pandora said it has to up the cost of its One subscription service, which was launched in 2009 and pipes songs to users without advertisements interrupting the stream. Users not wishing to pay the monthly fee can opt for the free Pandora service, which occasionally broadcasts ads between tracks.\n\nPandora \u2013 based in Oakland, California \u2013 claimed that it has 3.3 million subscribers on the One service. The free Pandora option boasts more than 250 million registered accounts.\n\nRoyalty fees have long been an issue of contention between Pandora and the record companies. The streaming music service has fought labels over what it claimed where prohibitively high costs for every song it streams, and in 2008 the two sides agreed to a settlement in which SoundExchange would collect royalties from Pandora on behalf of artists and labels.\n\nCritics of the web biz have charged that the company in fact short-changes rights holders and pays minuscule fees to stream songs compared to other broadcasters.\n\n\"A business that exists to deliver music can't really complain that its biggest cost is music,\" psychedelic Brit band Pink Floyd told to the company last year in a protest over payments. \"You don't hear grocery stores complain they have to pay for the food they sell.\"\n\nPandora, which opened its doors in 2000, also announced that its chief technology officer, Tom Conrad, will be leaving the company. A 10-year veteran of the biz, Conrad will step down from his post but remain with Pandora in an advisory role. Vice-president of engineering Chris Martin will take over the CTO position. \u00ae\n\nSponsored: Continuous lifecycle London 2017 event. DevOps, continuous delivery and containerisation.

Pandora had hopes of a rate of 1.7% but, with ASCAP looking for a whopping 3.0%, the final agreed upon rate, which was at the top of their range, is being called a win.\n\nSony Music CEO Martin Bandier said, \"This rate is a clear defeat for songwriters. This rate is woefully inadequate and further emphasizes of the need for reform in the rate court proceedings. Songwriters can't live in a world where streaming services only pay 1.85% of their revenue. This is a loss, and not something we can live with.\"\n\nThe songwriter\u2019s loss is Pandora\u2019s gain. And what did they do to celebrate this win? They decided to raise subscription prices.\n\nThe company made an announcement yesterday stating that, in the coming months, changes to the Pandora One subscription plan would be necessary to maintain the premium, ad free, experience. Since the company launched the $3.99 per month rate, SoundExchange rates have increased 53% and will increase another 9% in 2015.\n\nFor new subscribers the subscription price will change to $4.99 per month starting in May but, as a way of saying thank you to its earliest adopters (where is my thank you SiriusXM?), subscribers who remain active will continue to pay the old $3.99 rate.\n\nIn addition to rate change, Pandora is also dropping the $36 yearly plan but again, those old subscribers will be migrated to a discounted loyalty rate of $3.99 per month.\n\nWith 3.3 million subscribers, that is a lot of good grace Pandora is offering to keep those customers happy.\n\nIt should be noted that customers \u201cwill not experience a price increase at this time,\u201d the article does not mention just how long those loyal customers will be locked in for.","233":"Page Not Found\n\nYou have requested a page that cannot be found.\n\nWe have recently migrated our site to a new platform which is why old links may no longer work.

Pandora also said that existing users who currently pay $3.99 will see no change in their memberships.\n\n\n\nRoyalty rates that have risen by 53 percent in the past five years, and as they continue to raise for the next year, Pandora is looking to adjust by raising their membership plan prices. Chief Executive Brian McAndrews said in an interview last month that the success in advertising sales that Pandora has experienced have made the company's free offering more valuable than its subscription service.\n\n\n\n\"We feel good about monetization of both platforms,\" McAndrews said. \"It almost depends now what market and what time.\"\n\n\n\nPandora shares rose 1.1 percent to $35.36 in extended trading yesterday. The stock fell 0.4 percent to $34.98 at the close in New York, but then gained 32 percent this year.\n\n\n\nActive listeners in February reached 75.3 million, and Pandora One has reached 3.3 million subscribers, according to a post on their blog.\n\n\n\n\"The costs of delivering this service have grown considerably,\" Pandora said on Tuesday. \"We hope that you understand why we have taken these steps. Our goal is to continue to be your go-to internet radio destination.\"\n\n\n\nPandora is already one of the world's most popular streaming music services and although it has plenty of competition in the likes of Spotify and Apple's iTunes Radio, it is aggressively investing in local salesforces that will sell ad slots and expand its four-year-old service.\n\n\n\nThe company, which streams music from virtual radio stations to mobile devices, said in a blog post that royalties will rise another 9 percent in 2015.\n\n","235":"Pandora has announced a hike in the monthly subscription fee of Pandora One, a premium service that allows users to listen without advertising. Starting in May, new users will have to pay a subscription fee of $4.99 per month. \"Over the next couple of months, we will be implementing some changes to our Pandora One subscription plan\", the Pandora Team said in a blog post. Existing users will continue to pay $3.99 per month.\n\nAccording to Pandora, the reason behind the price hike is the service delivery cost, which has grown considerably in the last five years. Royalty rates have increased 53 percent in the same time frame, and will increase another 9 percent in 2015, the company said.\n\nThe company has also decided to scrap the annual subscription option. This means that you'll now only have the pay-per-month option. All annual subscribers will be migrated to a \"discounted loyalty price\" of $3.99 per month with their next renewal. They'll be notified as the update is applied to their subscription.\n\nGiven that the price hike will come into effect in May, those who want to get in for $3.99 a month can sign up now. That being said, this doesn\u2019t mean that the old subscription model will be around forever. The company currently has more than 250 million registered users, out of which only 3.3 million have subscribed to Pandora One.\n\nThis is the first time Pandora One has hiked its subscription price ever since it debuted in 2009. Initially, the service was priced at $36 per year, and later on, a $3.99 per month option was added.","236":"Detailed within a post on the official Pandora blog, the streaming music company plans to increase the monthly subscription rate for Pandora One by 25 percent for all new subscribers starting during May 2014. Specifically, the monthly subscription plan for Pandora One will rise from $3.99-a-month (approximately $48 a year) to $4.99-a-month (approximately $60 a year). In addition, Pandora will be ending the annual subscription option that provided access as a discounted rate of $36 for the year.\n\nProviding reasoning behind the price increase, a Pandora spokesperson wrote \u201cThe costs of delivering this service have grown considerably. For example, the royalty rates Pandora pays to performers via SoundExchange for subscription listening have increased 53% in the last five years and will increase another 9% in 2015.\u201d Out of Pandora\u2019s 250 million registered users, this change will affect 3.3 million paying subscribers that generate approximately $150 million in revenue per year.\n\nHowever, current Pandora One subscribers are going to be provided with a couple options to ease the transition. Anyone on the annual $36 plan will be grandfathered into the $3.99 monthly rate, assuming they want to continue subscribing to the service. In addition, any existing subscribers will get to continue paying the $3.99 monthly rate. Only new subscribers will have to pay the $4.99 monthly rate and that\u2019s assuming they wait until May to subscribe. Up until May 1, Pandora users that subscribe to the One service can lock in the $3.99 monthly rate for the life of their subscription.\n\nInterestingly, this makes iTunes Radio an even more value-driven option since the advertisement free version is priced at $25 per year. In addition, that subscription comes with enrollment in iTunes Match, a service that matches up your music with 256-Kbps AAC quality versions and allows you to access that music through the cloud on your iPad or iPhone. Of course, iTunes Radio is only available on Apple devices, thus Android and Windows Phone users are simply out of luck.","237":"It's not just Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime loyalty shopping program that is getting more expensive. Pandora (NYSE:P) revealed last night that its premium Pandora One offering will also soon set music buffs back a little more.\n\nExisting monthly Internet radio subscribers will continue to pay $3.99 a month -- for now -- but new subscribers will have to shell out $4.99 a month starting in May. This doesn't mean that existing premium members won't pay more. The annual Pandora One plan that costs $36 -- or $3 a month -- is being discontinued. Users will migrate to the $3.99-a-month plan.\n\nPandora said the increases are necessary. It hasn't tweaked its prices since 2009, yet in that time the royalty rates that it pays to artists through SoundExchange have soared 53%. It's a similar rationale that Amazon used with its $20 Prime fee increase, arguing that shipping costs alone have escalated in the nine years that it stuck to the $79-a-year pricing.\n\nHowever, some may wonder if Pandora is picking the wrong time to push through an increase. Amazon doesn't really have any material competition when it comes to e-commerce, but Pandora is starting to feel the pinch from the competition. Listener hours in February rose just 9% since last year's showing. This is the first time that year-over-year growth at Pandora has slumped into the single digits. It's a far cry from the 101% and 42% growth spurts that Pandora had posted in prior February installments.\n\nGrowth is still growth, but Pandora's monthly metrics have showed sequential spottiness since Apple introduced iTunes Radio in mid-September. One can argue that most of Pandora's listeners are freeloaders, making this increase irrelevant. That's true. Just 3.3 million of its 75.3 million active listeners are paying Pandora for commercial-free access. The other 72 million are fine putting up with ads and any other limitations that Pandora may throw their way.\n\nIn terms of premium competition, Sirius XM Radio (NASDAQ:SIRI) listeners with satellite receiver plans can pay an additional $4 a month for online access. Pandora's pricing now makes its online offering more expensive than Sirius XM's add-on platform. That's worth noting.\n\nThis still doesn't make the price hike a dumb move by Pandora. If anything, pre-announcing that the increase will take place in May could encourage current freeloaders to sign up for the $3.99 a month in the next few weeks so that they will be grandfathered into the lower rate. The move should also help with Pandora One churn. Folks will be less tempted to cancel the service if they know that coming back would cost them $4.99 a month.\n\nThat's important. Netflix has also suggested that it will eventually roll out higher prices to new members, generously grandfathering in existing members at existing rates. Amazon isn't being as generous with Prime, though it is waiting until annual renewal dates to institute the $20 increase.\n\nLeaning on the Internet for legal ad-free entertainment is starting to get more expensive. Now we have to see if consumers are willing to accept the increases.","238":"For proper use of this site, you need to enable javascript in your browser!","239":"Advertisement\n\nPandora One subscribers may be tempted to give a thumbs down to the company's upcoming price changes.\n\nThe streaming music service announced a major overhaul of its price structure, some of which will start to be seen immediately with the rest kicking in come May.\n\n\"Over the next couple of months, we will be implementing some changes to our Pandora One subscription plan so that loyal listeners can continue to enjoy a premium, ad-free Pandora experience, the company said on its blog.\n\nPandora said the price hike is necessary in order for the streaming music service to continue to be able to provide an ad-free option to its listeners. The company cited rising costs over the last five years and anticipated increases going forward tied to the fact that the company has not raised its $3.99 subscription price since 2009.\n\nSo here is the scoop. Those listeners now paying $3.99 per month for the service will not see any change, at least for right now. New subscribers will be charged $4.99 per month, however, if a person signs up before May first they will be assigned the old $3.99 cost. Pandora is eliminating its less expensive annual package, which was $36, and pushing all those users into the $3.99 per month club.\n\nStarting this week annual subscribers who are nearing their renewal date will be notified about the change.\n\nPandora said it has 250 million registered users with 3.3 million paid subscribers.\n\nEven with the price increase Pandora is much less expensive than its competitor Spotify, however, for the soon to be $4.99 price, the user gets a lot less functionality. Pandora One subscribers do not receive any ads, are allowed to skip more songs per day and are given longer periods of time without having their station time out.\n\nSpotify Premium customers pay $9.99 per month, but can play any track at any time, listen offline and not have to deal with ads. Offline mode downloads the songs you wish to hear onto your device while still connected.\n\nStreaming music services are booming right now, with 28 million people worldwide paying for a subscription in 2013, up from 20 million in 2012, according to a report issued by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.\n\nTAG Pandora, streaming music, Spotify\n\n\u00a9 2017 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

He expects some \u201clight churn\u201d in subscriber numbers \u2014 but not much.\n\n\u201cUltimately, Pandora\u2019s focus and future remains in improving monetization of ad-based, free listeners,\u201d Barrett said. After all, Pandora pays more per song for premium subscribers than for its common version.\n\nThe reason royalty fees are increasing is because SoundExchange, an organization that collects and distributes digital performance royalties to artists, is delivering more money to those artists. Pandora said those fees have increased 53% since 2009 and will jump another 9% next year.","241":"Pandora (NYSE:P) announced on Tuesday that it was raising prices for its ad-free, premium One service, and eliminating its annual subscription service. Beginning in May, the company will begin charging $5 a month to new Pandora One subscribers.\n\nPandora says it is raising prices to correspond with increased operating costs, largely due to the royalties it pays for music. Pandora is eliminating the $36 annual subscription, but says it will not raise prices for existing subscribers.\n\n\u201cThe royalty rates Pandora pays to performers via SoundExchange for subscription listening have increased 53% in the last five years,\u201d the company said in a blog post, \u201cand will increase another 9% in 2015.\u201d\n\nA court ruled earlier this month that Pandora must continue to pay a 1.85 percent royalty rate to the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP). Pandora argued that it should only pay 1.7 percent, the same as broadcast radio stations, whereas ASCAP was asking a gradual rate increase to three percent.\n\nPandora makes the majority of its money off of advertisements aired to over 246 non-paying listeners, about four times the amount it makes from its subscribers. Pandora said it had 3.3 million subscribers currently, although it refuses to disclose how many of those had annual subscriptions.\n\nThe company will retain the $4 a month price for current monthly subscribers as well as those who sign up before May 1. Annual subscribers, including those whose subscription ends after the cutoff date, will be offered the lower monthly subscription as well.\n\nPandora faces competition from a plethora of digital music services, most notably Spotify, which charges $10 a month for its premium music service. Spotify has a radio option for continuous play like Pandora, but is best known for its on-demand catalog, which allows users to select the artist, song or album that they listen to. Spotify has 24 million active users, with 6 million monthly subscribers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched its ad-based iTunes Radio in Sept. 2013. The service is free to users, but Apple charges $25 annually for iTunes Match, a cloud-based storage system that also removes ads from iTunes Radio.\n\nDaniel Freitas, age 26 from Corvallis, Ore., says he was surprised that Pandora has not yet notified him about the policy change, but he will most likely continue paying for the service.\n\n\"It's not a matter of [price] so much as convenience,\" Freitas said. \"I enjoy having the music, and I would rather drop a online movie account like Hulu Plus or something before I drop Pandora.\"\n\nFollow Reporter Thomas Halleck on Twitter @tommylikey","242":"Who doesn\u2019t love online radio service?

That gives would-be users of the streaming service a little more than a month to lock in the lower rate.\n\nExisting subscribers can still pay the old $4 monthly price, but the option for a $36 annual subscription is going away. All annual subscribers will automatically switch over to monthly billing at their renewal dates.\n\nIn addition to removing advertisements, Pandora One lets users skip more tracks per day and listen for longer periods without station pauses. The free, ad-supported version of Pandora will remain available.\n\nThe reason for the price hikes? Blame rising royalty rates, Pandora said in a blog post. The streaming service contends that its rates have grown by 53 percent over the last five years, and will increase by another 9 percent next year. Pandora had been fighting in court for lower rates, while the American Society for Composers, Authors and Publishers had been pushing for a rate increase. But earlier this week, a federal judge essentially decided to keep rates the same through 2015.\n\nTo deal with higher royalties, Pandora has also tried limiting its free version. Initially, desktop users were capped at 40 hours per month, but Pandora removed that limit in 2011. Last year, Pandora capped mobile listening at 40 hours per month, but changed its mind several months later. It seems that Pandora is now reluctant to tamper with its free service, which means Pandora's paying customers are left to take the brunt of the damage.","248":"(UPDATED) Pandora's been quite busy of late.

The free version of Pandora lets users play music, but with ads. Pandora limits the number of times that a user can skip a song.\n\nThe updated price will start in May. The existing annual subscribers will be transitioned to the updated monthly model upon the renewal.\n\n\u201cOur listeners are our top priority and, while this affects only a small percentage of our listeners (3.3 million subscribers of more than 250 million registered users total), we hope that you understand why we have taken these steps.

Pandora cites growing costs because of increased royalty rates paid to performers. However, the company says this change should affect only 3.3 million monthly subscribers (out ot more than 250 million total registered users). The company's new fees for its ad-free option is still significantly cheaper than Spotify's $9.99 a month, although the latter's service boasts offline playback.\n\nAccording to a 2011 study by NPD Group (via Recode), consumers are willing to spend between $45 and $65 per year on music, and Pandora's new prices put it in the higher end of that spectrum at $60 a year. That is still comfortably within range though, compared to Spotify's nearly $120 a year total. The same goes for similar services such as Rdio and Beats Music (both $9.99 per month).\n\nWhile it is cheaper, Pandora doesn't give you as much control over what you listen to (it's more like a radio than a custom playlist setup), and it has a smaller library than the rest. If you're looking for more features, Spotify, Rdio or Beats may serve you better, but those who are cash-strapped and want a cheaper alternative will find Pandora a more affordable option, even with the price hike.\n\nFollow Cherlynn Low at @CherlynnLow and on Google+.

The $36 annual plan for Pandora One is no more thanks to a 53% increase in royalty costs in the past five years. That number is expected to increase another 9% by 2015. New customers to the service will have to select the $4.99 per month plan, while annual users will be pushed into a $3.99 per month plan. The move raises subscription prices for annual users by 33%, and 25% for new users looking for a monthly plan.\n\nCurrent customers on the $3.99 monthly plan will be grandfathered in at that price for the duration of their subscription.

The company recently set a 52-week high of $40.44, and the new pricing structure should reassure investors going into earnings season.\n\nOne issue that always surrounds a price increase is will users stick around? The price is low enough that Pandora shouldn\u2019t see any mass exodus away from the service. The new subscription tier will not kick in until May, so the company has a window to market the low cost option to new subscribers.","257":"HTTP Status 500 -\n\ntype Exception report\n\nmessage\n\ndescription The server encountered an internal error () that prevented it from fulfilling this request.\n\nexception\n\norg.apache.jasper.JasperException: java.lang.NullPointerException org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServletWrapper.service(JspServletWrapper.java:372) org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet.serviceJspFile(JspServlet.java:292) org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet.service(JspServlet.java:236) javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:722) org.apache.jasper.runtime.PageContextImpl.doForward(PageContextImpl.java:670) org.apache.jasper.runtime.PageContextImpl.forward(PageContextImpl.java:637) org.apache.jsp.news_jsp._jspService(news_jsp.java:149) org.apache.jasper.runtime.HttpJspBase.service(HttpJspBase.java:94) javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:722) org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServletWrapper.service(JspServletWrapper.java:324) org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet.serviceJspFile(JspServlet.java:292) org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet.service(JspServlet.java:236) javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:722) org.tuckey.web.filters.urlrewrite.NormalRewrittenUrl.doRewrite(NormalRewrittenUrl.java:213) org.tuckey.web.filters.urlrewrite.RuleChain.handleRewrite(RuleChain.java:171) org.tuckey.web.filters.urlrewrite.RuleChain.doRules(RuleChain.java:145) org.tuckey.web.filters.urlrewrite.UrlRewriter.processRequest(UrlRewriter.java:92) org.tuckey.web.filters.urlrewrite.UrlRewriteFilter.doFilter(UrlRewriteFilter.java:381) com.burn.mobile.filters.PrettyURL.doFilter(PrettyURL.java:42)\n\nroot cause\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\nnote The full stack trace of the root cause is available in the Apache Tomcat\/7.0.6 logs.\n\nApache Tomcat\/7.0.6","258":"Advertisement\n\nThe automated music recommendation service Pandora Media Inc. increased its ad-free service fee by $1 per month to cover the increasing cost of licensing tunes and royalties paid to the artists.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pandora One announced that the cost of streaming ad-free music increases as the royalty rates paid to musicians through SoundExchange have increased by 53 percent.

It was offered for $36 per year as well as $3.99 per month (which comes out to $48 per year). The new pricing means users will end up paying about $50 per year.\n\nPandora says that over the last five years, the costs of delivering its service have grown \u201cconsiderably.\u201d Royalty rates the company pays to performers via SoundExchange, for example, have increased by 53 percent.

In addition, the ability to play games online together with friends on Tango has driven an increasing amount of game downloads and activity.\n\nTango's evolution toward an all-in-one messaging, social and content platform has helped double registered users to 200 million compared to a year ago, and monthly active users has reached 70 million.\n\n\"A whole new level of connection and sharing of experiences is available through messaging apps that fundamentally affects the way content gets distributed on mobile,\" said CTO and co-founder Eric Setton. \"This round of funding will enable us to continue to innovate, hire the best talent, aggressively expand our content partnerships, and build a world-class platform as we go after what is truly a big opportunity.\"\n\nTango previously raised $87 million from Access Industries, DFJ, Qualcomm Ventures, Toms Capital and Translink Capital, as well as Bill Tai, Shimon Weintraub, Jerry Yang, Alex Zubillaga and others.

Tango also serves as a social media platform, allowing users to discover people around them and chat with them. Users can also play games with their friends, share photos and even music. Tango believes that providing more features will entice more users to sign up for it, and it believes it can even be bigger than WhatsApp one day.\n\nTango isn\u2019t the only one to be attracting big money though. As we all know, WhatsApp was recently acquired by Facebook for a whopping $19 billion in cash and stocks, while the second-biggest messaging service by number of registered users, Viber, was acquired by Rakuten for $900 million earlier this year.\n\nThe sudden interest in investing in or acquiring mobile messaging services stems from the fact that this is where consumers are most active. Ads can easily be placed in these services to reach more people and increase revenues. And if people hate the ads, it\u2019s always possible to ask for a subscription fee to go ad-free. Emojis and emoticons are now being replaced by stickers that are more vibrant, playful and interesting, and consumers don\u2019t mind paying $1 to get a full set of stickers.\n\nThough other messaging service are more popular than Tango, the startup is banking on word of mouth to boost its popularity.","281":"PanARMENIAN.Net - Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group is investing $215 million to acquire a minority stake and a seat in the board of Tango, a mobile messaging app from the U.S.\n\nAccording to PCWorld, the investment announced Thursday, March 20, by the Chinese company follows investments by some other Internet companies in mobile messaging apps.

Tango, a Mountain View, Calif., startup, has accumulated the audience in just four years since the debut of its mobile messaging service.\n\nAnother group of investors that includes Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang is anteing an additional $65 million to raise the total funding round to $280 million.\n\nAlibaba is buying into Tango's future just a month after online social networking leader Facebook Inc. announced plans to acquire mobile messaging service WhatsApp for $19 billion. That deal came together after another mobile messaging service, Snapchat, rejected a $3 billion takeover offer from Facebook, according to reports in newspapers and technology blogs that cited people familiar with the negotiations.\n\nYet another mobile messaging specialist, Viber Media, sold for $900 million last month to Japan's Rakuten Inc.\n\nIt's likely that Tango is now valued at more than $1 billion, although the privately held company isn't disclosing the size of the stake being sold to Alibaba. Tango has raised a total $367 million since its inception.\n\nThe latest infusion will be used to expand Tango's workforce of 160 employees and develop more features for its service, according to its co-founder Eric Setton.\n\nTango's audience is half the size of WhatsApp, which boasts more than 450 million users.\n\nAlibaba launched its own mobile messaging service last year, but now has a piece of a larger player in the communications space.\n\n\"We were simply blown away by the vision and quality of the team at Tango and believe they have a disruptive way of looking at the mobile and messaging opportunity,\" said Joe Tsai, Alibaba's executive vice chairman.\n\nAlibaba is also privately held, but is preparing to sell its stock later this year in an initial public offering that could raise $15 billion. Its IPO is being hotly anticipated because it has built the most prosperous e-commerce site in China. Mobile messaging might open up more ways for merchants to sell their goods through Alibaba, although Setton says Alibaba's investment doesn't include the rights to use the Tango app as part of its business.\n\nTango, WhatsApp and similar services have exploded in popularity during the past few years after they released applications made for the iPhone and Android smartphones. Those applications, collectively, have supplanted sending traditional texts through the services of telecommunications providers as the most popular way for people on the go to keep in touch with their friends and family.\n\nThe apps also accommodate more than just texts. Tango, for instance, allows music to be shared through Spotify's streaming service and also provides social networking services.","287":"Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group has paid $215m for a minority stake in mobile messaging app maker Tango.\n\nTango said it raised $280m (\u00a3169m, \u20ac202m) in a new funding round led by the Chinese firm.

But it was the emotional connection with family living in other parts of the world that inspired our mission here at Tango. Back then we felt that free online communication through texts, voice and video calls would remove barriers and change the world. The world agreed: we signed up our first million members in the first 10 days after launch.\u201d\n\nThe platform has evolved to allow users to communicate around photos, music, voice and video messages, as well as video games.\n\nIt has even created its own SDK for developers to create Tango-powered games.\n\n\u201cWhile we\u2019ve made progress on our mission to enable people to communicate, share and feel more connected, we are just beginning to scratch the surface of what\u2019s possible.

We see an even bigger opportunity \u2013 one where people can have access to free communication, social networking features and enjoyable content \u2013 all within a single platform.\n\n\u201cOver the past eight months, Tango has evolved. We\u2019ve introduced a content platform that is now home to more than 30 games.

And we\u2019ve introduced social music sharing through integration with Spotify, which means members can now send each other songs.\n\n\u201cQuite honestly, the results have blown us away. We\u2019re excited by the 2x increase in daily engagement since last July.

Setton says Tango is also particularly strong in Western Europe, the Middle East and parts of Southeast Asia, but the company trails WhatsApp (450 million active users), WeChat (355 million active users), Viber (over 100 million active users), and Line (300 million registered users) globally.\n\nThe deal is hugely significant for both parties: Tango gets the means to ramp up its hiring and content partnerships to chase its larger rivals, while Alibaba gets a stake in (and perhaps is a step closer to owning) a global messaging player.\n\nSetton says the two companies \u201cclicked\u201d instantly after initial talks \u2014 which were set up by Yahoo founder Jerry Yang, a Tango investor \u2014 and are \u201caligned on the vision and strategy of mobile messaging.\u201d\n\nAlibaba, for its part, provided only a canned statement which praises Tango\u2019s \u201ctremendous growth\u201d and \u201cunique approach\u201d to messaging.\n\n\u201cWe were simply blown away by the vision and quality of the team at Tango and believe they have a disruptive way of looking at the mobile and messaging opportunity,\u201d says Joe Tsai, Executive Vice Chairman of Alibaba Group.\n\nUnlike many of its US rivals, Tango\u2019s set of features closely mirror that of Asia\u2019s content-rich messaging apps like Line and WeChat. Rather than stick just to photo and text messaging, Tango introduced a games platform last year, partnered with Spotify for music sharing and jumped on the sticker bandwagon before it became the industry standard.\n\nThose features make it exactly the kind of service that Alibaba itself is sorely missing.\n\nAlibaba in need of an answer to messaging apps\n\nDespite its stranglehold on China\u2019s e-commerce space, Alibaba is under pressure as arch rival Tencent\u2019s WeChat app has emerged as the key social platform for smartphone users. The majority of WeChat\u2019s 355 million monthly users are based in China, and Tencent is piping a range of services \u2014 including e-commerce \u2014 into the app which is turning it into a key channel for retailers, brands and frankly any company that wants a slice of Chinese consumers\u2019 attention.\n\nWhile WeChat\u2019s e-commerce play is still in its early stages, its sheer size and distribution potential makes it a concern for Alibaba. The e-commerce firm introduced its own messaging app \u2014 Laiwang \u2014 last year but, though it gained 10 million registered users within its first month, it sits a long way behind WeChat.\n\nSetton says that the deal will help boost Tango in China and other parts of Asia, but there is no China-specific partnership involved. Tango isn\u2019t about to solve the WeChat dilemma for Alibaba anyway, since it has a low profile in China despite having an engineering office in the country, but there are plenty of synergies for Alibaba to leverage.\n\nFor a start, the Chinese company recently confirmed its intention for a public listing in the US, which analysts predict could value it at over $150 billion. Taking a stake in one of America\u2019s most prominent messaging apps while the market there is still nascent makes a lot of sense, Alibaba\u2019s business will need to expand out of China in time to provide growth opportunities for investors.\n\nUS messaging market potential\n\nSetton believes that tapping into Alibaba will \u201cbring a crystal ball into our boardroom\u2026 Asia has insight that is around a year ahead of the West right now,\u201d he explains.\n\nIt\u2019s currently unclear if US consumers want games, e-commerce and more inside their chat apps, but if messaging is going to be as important in the US as it is in China, then Alibaba needs a piece of the action.\n\nAlthough it has only tentatively dipped its toes in the US \u2014 via two third-party US retails sites it owns, and an investment in Shoprunner \u2014 it missed the messaging opportunity in China, and won\u2019t want to let history repeat itself in the US market.\n\nSetton says that there are no plans to introduce Alibaba services into Tango at this point \u2014 he ducked the question of whether Alibaba might one day buy the startup outright \u2014 but this deal is certainly one to watch. We\u2019d expect Alibaba to closely monitor Tango\u2019s progress and the maturity of the US messaging market with a view to an acquisition when the time is right.\n\nFor now though, the deal is a further signal of Alibaba\u2019s intention to expand into the US and another proof point of the importance of messaging apps. It seems likely that we can expect other large scale US acquisitions and investments from Alibaba both pre- and post-IPO.\n\nHeadline image via Peter Parks \/ Getty Images\/AFP\n\nRead next: Mongolia cracks down on online media with a list of over 700 (amusing) banned words","299":"Tango has just announced it has closed a $280 million round of funding, led by Alibaba Group with $215 million.

Of that investment, $215 million came from Alibaba, with the other $65 million from previous investors.\n\nTango has previously raised $87 million in total, including $42 million in July 2011 and then another $40 million in a Series C funding in April 2012. Investors in the company include Access Industries, DFJ, Qualcomm Ventures, Toms Capital and Translink Capital, as well as Bill Tai, Shimon Weintraub, Jerry Yang, Alex Zubillaga and others.\n\nAs part of this financing, Michael Zeisser from Alibaba will be joining Tango's Board of Directors.\n\nIncluding the new round, Tango has now raised $367 million in venture capital financing to date.

The landmark round will give Alibaba, a company best known for dominating China\u2019s e-commerce landscape, a minority stake in Tango, contributing $215 million. To date, Tango has raised $367 million.\n\nThe company declined to share its current valuation.\n\nToday, Tango has 200 million registered users, and 70 million monthly actives, generally aged 25 to 45.\n\nAccording to co-founder and CTO Eric Setton, Facebook\u2019s acquisition of WhatsApp opened people\u2019s eyes to the value that messaging apps can create. \u201cMessaging apps can go beyond communications, and can be used to discover new things like games, music and other content,\u201d he says. \u201cAt Tango, we\u2019re facilitating this discovery with our content platform and social networking features combined with communications.\u201d\n\nFor background, Mountain View-based Tango, founded in 2009, began as something of an Apple FaceTime competitor, at a time when FaceTime was limited to specific iPhone models and required Wi-Fi to work. Tango came in with an alternative service that allowed users to make video calls on iOS or Android, and over 3G networks. In the years since, the company has been evolving its platform to offer more communication features, including things like photo-sharing, music-sharing, voice and video messages, and even gaming. An in-app store sells upgrades like stickers and other decorations, and Tango\u2019s ad platform, launched in December, is \u201cwell above industry averages\u201d in terms of click-thru rates and conversations, the company tells us.\n\nTango users have also been able to play games with in the app for some time. Gaming, as it turns out, is a popular activity for many mobile messaging users these days, especially on competing networks popular in parts of Asia, like Line, which is big in Japan, and Chinese messaging service WeChat.\n\nAnd last year, Tango began to transition more seriously into mobile gaming, with its own Tango-powered iOS games, built in-house, as well as those built by partners using the Tango SDK launched in June 2013. This allowed third-party developers a way to offer social features within their applications, without relying on things like Facebook Connect, for example.\n\nToday, that content platform has grown to 40 content and and gaming partners who share revenue back with Tango from in-app purchases on the Tango platform.\n\nNot entirely coincidentally, Tango\u2019s lead investor Alibaba recently announced its intentions to build a mobile gaming network to compete with rival Tencent, makers of WeChat. China today has one of the world\u2019s largest gaming markets, with over 490 million users, and a market size of roughly $13.7 billion. It makes sense, then, that it would take a stake in something like Tango, which has been rapidly growing both its mobile messaging user base and its mobile gaming footprint.\n\nSetton confirms that gaming is, in fact, a big part of Tango\u2019s strategy going forward, explaining that Tango is different from utility messengers focused on just communications.\n\n\u201cContent can be the pretext for conversation, and because of that \u2013 we\u2019re going after a very big opportunity here. We need to be well capitalized to do it,\u201d he says. \u201cWith this funding we will have the opportunity to pursue further content partnerships. Think about AAA game titles or world-renowned artists that we can sign up to Tango\u2019s platform.\u201d\n\nThough Tango and Alibaba\u2019s interests align when it comes to mobile gaming, Tango doesn\u2019t yet have a significant stake in China, with 31% of users from North America, 20% from Asia, 12% from Europe, 29% from the Middle East, and 8% from everywhere else. But Setton believes that will now change following this investment, and the exposure it will provide Tango, whose app, he says, takes a similar approach to other messaging apps popular throughout Asia, including Kakao, Line and WeChat.\n\n\u201cAlibaba not only provides great expertise, leadership and strategic support in helping us scale our business, but they also help us by providing a unique view into the Asian markets which are a couple years ahead in mobile messaging,\u201d says Setton. That being said, he admits the messaging space is the most competitive on the market today, and requires effort as well as \u201ctremendous financial means.\u201d The company plans to use the funding for further product innovations, hiring, aggressively expansion of its content partnerships, and development of its platform.","305":"So, you thought the messaging mania would go away after Facebook bought What\u2019sApp?\n\nLOL.\n\nThere\u2019s still more money \u2013 lots of it \u2013 flying around Silicon Valley aimed at those who text and send songs to each other.

In addition, Icahn said a partially independent PayPal could pursue more partnerships, such as with the credit card companies or with Facebook, and it would develop a \u201cstartup mentality\u201d that leads to expanded product offerings.\n\nIn response, eBay management issued a statement late Wednesday afternoon that said in part:\n\n\u201cPayPal and eBay are better together.

Since then, Icahn has openly and aggressively denigrated the company\u2019s CEO and board, mostly focusing on the sale of Skype to a group of investors that included Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm that includes eBay director Marc Andreessen.\n\neBay has fought back with increasingly confrontational blog posts and responses from outside parties, while weathering a storm that has moved so far afield that one analyst suggested the best possible move would be a Google acquisition of eBay.\n\nIcahn toned down his language Wednesday in another missive that offered a compromise: Sell 20 percent of PayPal in an IPO, while signing a deal that ensures that the synergies between the two companies that benefit PayPal remain after the stock sale.\n\n\u201cA 20% IPO of PayPal could allow for all of the benefits of an independent PayPal, preserves all of the benefits of keeping PayPal in-house and could be structured so as to be tax free to shareholders,\u201d Icahn wrote.\n\nLate in Wednesday\u2019s trading session, eBay responded with a blog post that likewise avoided a confrontational tone, but still refused to go down Icahn\u2019s suggested path.\n\n\u201cA partial separation of PayPal is not a new idea, and we\u2019re glad to see that Mr. Icahn now seems to agree that a full separation of PayPal is not a good idea,\u201d the company\u2019s blog post read, while continuing to shoot down the partial IPO.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve asked ourselves: Will a partial spin make PayPal more competitive?

San Mateo\u2019s SolarCity suffered the most severe tumble, declining 5.7 percent to $72.70 after its delayed report showed a profit that was mostly provided by a tax benefit.\n\nFacebook and Google both fell despite an eMarketer report that predicted the online-advertising industry would grow 75 percent in 2014 to $31.5 billion, mostly thanks to the efforts of the two Silicon Valley companies. Google declined 1 percent to $1,199.25 after a judge refused to accept class-action status for a lawsuit dealing with Gmail privacy issues, and Facebook fell 1.4 percent to $68.24 while continuing to prepare for the debut of video advertising on the social network.

(Reporting by Phil Wahba in New York; editing by Andrew Hay and Tom Brown)","331":"In his most recent open letter to eBay shareholders, activist investor Carl Icahn outlined the plan for splitting PayPal and eBay that he's been hinting at for weeks.\n\nHe thinks that eBay should go through an initial public offering of PayPal, selling 20% of the company to the public while keeping majority ownership.\n\nHe says that bringing only 20% of the company public could allow it to increase product offerings and innovations and be more attractive to top talent and potential acquisitions, while also preserving the benefits to eBay of keeping PayPal in-house.\n\nIcahn's rationale is that if the companies are separated, they will each be able to better focus on separate plans for longterm growth.\n\nNaturally, Icahn also uses his letter to take some digs at board member Marc Andreessen, who he has long been accusing of not having eBay's best interests in mind. He says that another benefit of a partial IPO would be restructured boards.\n\neBay has responded with a letter of its own , stating that although it has considered a partial IPO, it has also considered whether it would accelerate growth and create sustainable value and decided that now is not the right time.\n\nHere's Icahn's full letter :\n\nWe believe eBay could easily conduct an Initial Public Offering of PayPal, selling 20% to the public. eBay would retain 80% of PayPal with control. Before the transaction is consummated the companies could enter into a long-term, commercially viable contract, preserving all synergies. This type of relationship is customary in partial IPOs and would be particularly important for eBay as currently, outside of PayPal, there does not exist a global payment processing solution competent enough to service eBay's users. Luckily for PayPal, competitors such as Google, Apple and many others do not yet have the same comparable scale and product offerings.\n\nWe believe conducting a 20% IPO of PayPal - and creating two dedicated and highly-focused independent businesses - will provide the best opportunity for these businesses to remain competitive over the long-term. The 20% IPO structure should alleviate any concern of lost synergies. All of the \"secret sauce\" and \"flywheels\" would be preserved. A 20% IPO of PayPal could allow for all of the benefits of an independent PayPal, preserves all of the benefits of keeping PayPal in-house and could be structured so as to be tax free to shareholders.\n\nBenefits of a 20% IPO of PayPal\n\n1) Highlights Value\n\nCurrently, we believe the fair market value of eBay and PayPal are shrouded by a conglomerate discount. When compared to other e-commerce companies (such as Amazon) and financial services companies (such as Visa and MasterCard), eBay has trailed its peers in both valuation and performance over all relevant time periods. [1] We believe the fact that eBay and PayPal are currently combined makes it difficult for investors and analysts to properly value and fully understand the underlying businesses. We believe that a separation of the businesses will allow investors and analysts to more clearly see the value of both the sustainable double digit growth at PayPal and the strong recurring free cash flows of eBay. Both eBay and PayPal are tremendously strong businesses, but they appeal to different types of investors. We expect that an IPO of PayPal, thereby creating two focused equities, each with clear prospects and strategies for investors and analysts to consider, would enable both companies to attract a more natural shareholder base.\n\n2) Focuses Management Teams\n\nIn our opinion, eBay and PayPal would benefit tremendously from having their own independent management teams focused only on making the best strategic decisions regarding the long-term health of their respective businesses. We believe that independent management teams, together with newly constituted boards of directors (as further described below), would bring an increased level of focus to the decisions that need to be made as eBay and PayPal travel along different trajectories. Each company needs, among other things, its own business-specific long-term operational, financial and business development strategies. We believe fully focused management teams and boards of directors will be essential in ensuring long-term value creation in both businesses.\n\n3) Creates a Valuable Currency for Acquisitions and Attracting Top Talent\n\nWe believe the stock of an independent PayPal would be a valuable currency for future acquisition opportunities. eBay recently paid $800 million in cash to acquire Braintree on behalf of PayPal. We believe consolidation in the currently fragmented and quickly developing payment processing industry is inevitable, and an independent PayPal, armed with its own stock as currency, will be better able to participate advantageously in that inevitable consolidation. In fact, a more valuable currency would allow PayPal to take advantage of even more opportunities in the marketplace (as so many other technology companies do). While we are not currently advocating any specific acquisition, we believe it is likely that PayPal will continue to expand the scope of its technology through acquisitions.\n\nIn addition, from our research, it is clear to us that eBay and PayPal have faced significant challenges in recruiting top talent. In the words of Mr. David Marcus, the President of PayPal: \"Under the old format many great technologists left. If you had a choice between Google and PayPal you'd go to Google.\" [2] While Mr. Marcus may believe this problem is no longer the case after only two years in his current post, we believe the reality is that the best minds are not going to eBay. We hope that Mr. Marcus has started changing the perception of eBay, but we believe PayPal would be much better positioned to attract and motivate top talent, which is the lifeblood of its business, with an incentive plan that was tied to the successful operating performance of PayPal and its own stock price. Just recently (February 2014), in an email from Mr. Marcus to PayPal employees at eBay's headquarters in San Jose [3] , Mr. Marcus lamented how disinterested employees were relative to other PayPal offices. This type of direct communication from PayPal's President only reinforces our belief that PayPal employees will be more motivated when the company operates independently of eBay, with a clear strategic vision and a currency which would be more closely aligned with the performance of its employees.\n\n4) Prevents Dissynergies\n\nAlthough eBay's management asserts that there are \"synergies\" that exist only by keeping eBay and PayPal together, they offer little in the way of quantitative support. On the other hand, we believe there are in fact significant \"dissynergies\" that burden the companies by keeping them together. For example, we believe a standalone PayPal would be more able to pursue potential strategic partnerships with other industry leaders, such as Visa, MasterCard, Google, Facebook, Alibaba, etc., that could solidify PayPal's long-term relevance. This could include potential strategic investments. Facebook recently paid $19 billion for WhatsApp (of which only $4 billion was cash, the balance stock), a global messaging service. But, for a fraction of that price, Facebook could have instead purchased a significant stake in PayPal and launched the service across its platform - talk about value creation! We believe this same situation would hold for Apple, Google, and many others who could stand to gain by partnering with PayPal. We believe it is clear within eBay, these opportunities simply do not exist for PayPal. As another example, according to industry sources, PayPal recently ended a successful partnership with Aliexpress.com, in fear of the company ultimately competing with eBay. [4] In our opinion, with PayPal as a standalone company, this profitable and growing relationship would not have ended prematurely.\n\n5) Preserves Current Synergies\n\nWe believe that the only potentially legitimate defense that eBay's management has offered to date - certain synergies that result from keeping eBay and PayPal together - can be maintained through a contractual business relationship consummated before an IPO and do not actually require eBay owning 100% of PayPal. Some of the synergies eBay's CEO John Donahoe has expounded are, in our opinion, imagined. For example, we believe that funding the growth of an independent PayPal, which Mr. Donahoe seems to believe only eBay can do, [5] would never be an issue for an independent PayPal because it generates over $2 billion in EBITDA and would have a strong cash balance as the combined company currently has nearly $14 billion of cash on the balance sheet which would only grow with incremental IPO proceeds. Either way, we believe, as many other companies have proved, eBay's 80% ownership of PayPal and a commercially advantageous long-term contract between the two companies, would preserve any potential synergies.\n\n6) Extends PayPal's Product Offerings\n\nWe believe PayPal has a significant opportunity to expand its product offerings to include check writing, direct deposits, interest on PayPal balances and other financial conveniences that consumers expect, which were highlighted by David O. Sacks, one of the original architects of PayPal. [6] Under the current eBay leadership, PayPal has actually removed beneficial services to customers such as providing interest on PayPal deposits. We believe that focus from a dedicated management team, unencumbered by competing agendas, could drive more innovation at a faster pace. eBay is akin to a slow moving battleship at sea, which may be fine for eBay, as its marketplace business is not capable of the growth rates experienced a decade ago. PayPal, on the other hand, needs to be able to react quickly to a rapidly changing payments landscape, not only in the face of new competitors such as Square (a company eBay director Marc Andreessen publicly stated he wished he invested in), Bitcoin (the digital currency Mr. Andreessen cheerleads for), Boku (an Andreessen investment), Coinbase (another Andreessen investment), Dwolla (another Andreessen investment), and Jumio (yet again, another Andreessen investment), among others, but also in the face of competition from technology juggernauts such as Google, Apple and Intuit (where eBay director Scott Cook owns over $1 billion in stock and is an employee, board member and chairman of the executive committee). PayPal needs to have a startup mentality as it seeks to capitalize on its head start in the fast growing multi-trillion dollar global payments industry. We believe that this has not and will not happen successfully within eBay.\n\n7) Allows for True \"World-Class\" Boards\n\nAs separate companies, eBay and PayPal would have the opportunity to reconstitute their boards of directors and appoint board members who are not conflicted and do not compete with the underlying companies. We believe there are many great minds in the world who would be honored to serve as fiduciaries for the stockholders of an independent eBay or an independent PayPal.\n\nConclusion\n\nOver the last few weeks, we have raised a number of troubling questions regarding corporate governance at eBay. Sadly, in our opinion, these questions have never been adequately answered by eBay. Now, we have given a basic overview of the reasons we believe a 20% IPO of PayPal could be advantageous for the companies, employees and stockholders. We hope that eBay's management is paying attention and decides to respond to this first message on the topic in a productive, transparent manner.\n\nPayPal is a tremendous company, but it is on the verge of going to war against strong adversaries, and only with the benefits of being an independent company, as described above, will PayPal be capable of winning that war. We look forward to continuing to share with all shareholders our thoughts over the coming weeks and thank you for your continued support of our efforts.","332":"Check out which companies are making headlines after the bell Wednesday:\n\nGuess - The clothing retailer posted quarterly earnings that topped expectations and also increased its quarterly dividend by 12 percent.

He released a new statement on the topic via his site Shareholders\u2019 Square Table today.\n\nIcahn: eBay should spin off 20% of PayPal\n\nThe activist investor is now calling for eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) to spin off just 20% of PayPal and keep the other 80% of it.

Sadly, in our opinion, these questions have never been adequately answered by eBay.

At the time, Icahn suggested (putting it mildly) that PayPal should be spun off.\n\nEbay didn't agree.\n\nBy the end of February, Pierre Omidyar, founder and chairman of the board of eBay Inc., published a pointed letter rebuffing Icahn's public criticism of eBay CEO John Donahue as well as two prominent shareholders, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen and Intuit founder Scott Cook.\n\nSince then there has been a flurry of public memos and outbursts volleyed back and forth, including one by Icahn arguing that Icahn that Andreessen had too many conflicts during the Skype sale, putting up his reputation for further scrutiny.\n\nThen last week, eBay took things to a new level in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, urging shareholders to ignore both Icahn's nominees for the board of directors while encouraging them to re-elect CEO John Donahoe and director Fred Anderson.\n\nThis story originally appeared as \"Icahn's latest tip: eBay should sell 20 percent of PayPal via IPO\" on ZDNet.","336":"SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) \u2014 It\u2019s no secret that Carl Icahn has had a vision of which way eBay Inc. should go with its PayPal electronics-payment business.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, that vision got a little clearer. If your idea of perfect vision is 80\/20, anyway.\n\nThat\u2019s the view Icahn believes eBay EBAY, +1.54% should have with regards to PayPal. Specifically, he called for eBay to sell off 20% of PayPal in a public-stock offering and maintain an 80% ownership stake in the business. Icahn made his views known in what may be his longest screed since he began battling with eBay over PayPal, and certain members of the eBay board of directors several weeks ago.\n\n\u201cWe believe conducting a 20% IPO of PayPal \u2013 and creating two dedicated and highly-focused independent businesses \u2013 will provide the best opportunity for these businesses to remain competitive over the long-term,\u201d Icahn wrote in his latest open letter to eBay shareholders. \u201cThe 20% IPO structure should alleviate any concern of lost synergies. All of the \u201csecret sauce\u201d and \u201cflywheels\u201d would be preserved.\n\nIcahn, who owns about 2% of eBay\u2019s stock, gave what might as well be called his \u201cseven points\u201d for why he thinks it makes sense for eBay to spin off 20% of PayPal into a separate, publicly traded company. In a nutshell, Icahn said such a move:\n\n1) Highlights value. \u201cA separation of the businesses will allow investors and analysts to more clearly see the value\u201d of what Icahn called PayPal\u2019s sustainable double-digit growth and eBay\u2019s strong free cash flow.\n\n2) Focuses management teams. This has been a big one for Icahn, who has repeatedly said the \u201cinexcusable incompetence\u201d of eBay\u2019s management has cost its shareholders billions of dollars.\n\n3) Creates a valuable currency for acquisitions and attracting top talent. Icahn noted eBay\u2019s recent $800 million purchase of Braintree in order to incorporate its payments processes with PayPal, but said PayPal\u2019s stock would be \u201ca more valuable currency\u201d on its own for incorporating advantages in the payments business. Icahn went on to say that \u201cPayPal employees will be more motivated when the company operates independently of eBay.\u201d\n\n4) Prevent dissynergies. Icahn hinted that PayPal, by being so tied to eBay, is unable to pursue potential strategic partnerships with the likes of Google Inc. GOOG, +0.51% and Facebook Inc. FB, +0.04%\n\n5) Preserves current synergies. The main point here being Icahn\u2019s belief that eBay and PayPal should have \u201ca commercially advantageous long-term contract between the two companies.\u201d\n\n6) Extends PayPal product offerings. \u201cWe believe that focus from a dedicated management team, unencumbered by competing agendas, could drive more innovation at a faster pace,\u201d Icahn said, adding that the company has a \u201csignificant opportunity\u201d to offer products such as check writing, direct deposits and interest on PayPal balances.\n\n7) Allows for true \u201cworld-class\u201d boards. Throw a dart and you can probably hit one of the many reasons Icahn is mad at eBay\u2019s current board of directors, and members Marc Andreessen and Scott Cook, in particular.\n\nFor its part, eBay has no plans to separate PayPal. Why should it? In 2013, PayPal accounted for $6.6 billion of eBay\u2019s total $16 billion in sales. EBay has even set up a Web page to highlight why it thinks the two businesses are \u201cbetter together.\u201d Among the points eBay makes is that eBay is responsible for delivering 30% of PayPal\u2019s new users and 50% of PayPal\u2019s mobile volume.\n\nAnd just before the market closed, eBay issued a statement of its own, saying \u201cBeing part of eBay Inc. for more than a decade has enabled PayPal\u2019s strong growth and global leadership position in digital payments.\u201d EBay added that since PayPal became part of the company, it has built relationships with the likes of Visa V, +0.37% MasterCard MA, -0.03% and Facebook FB, +0.04%\n\nBut will Icahn\u2019s vision be clear enough to sway Wall Street, or eBay shareholders, in his favor?\n\n\u201cHe says analysts can\u2019t analyze the business properly, and a partial IPO would help,\u201d said Gil Luria, who covers eBay for Wedbush Securities and has a buy rating and $70-a-share price target on eBay\u2019s stock. \u201cThe truth is we know the revenue numbers and we have all we need to do our jobs.\u201d\n\n\n\nLuria admitted that Icahn\u2019s ideas \u201ccould unlock some short-term value,\u201d but over the long run, he thinks PayPal is more valuable with eBay.\n\n\u201cHe certainly writes these things with an amount of humor,\u201d said Gil Luria. \u201cThese points have been made in the past, so there\u2019s nothing too surprising here.\u201d\n\nSurprising or not, neither eBay or Icahn are likely to adjust their vision of each other any time soon.\n\nMore tech news from MarketWatch:\n\nOracle slips as competition seen gaining ground\n\nMicrosoft ready to bring Office to the iPad\n\n\u2018Candy Crush\u2019 creator\u2019s IPO: Zynga redux?","337":"You are using an older browser version. Please use a supported version for the best MSN experience.","338":"UPDATE: See eBay's response at end of the post.\n\nCarl Icahn fired off another letter to shareholders today, purposing that it spin off 20% of its PayPal division in a public offering. Icahn held back the verbal punches he's thrown at eBay CEO John Donahoe and board members Marc Andreessen and Scott Cook in previous letters, and instead laid out reasons why he believes the 20% spin off would be good for eBay, PayPal and shareholders. Some ideas were spot on, others might have missed the mark. First, here's Icahn's arguments for an eBay \/ PayPal spin off:\n\n1) It would unlock value:\n\nCurrently, we believe the fair market value of eBay and PayPal are shrouded by a conglomerate discount. When compared to other e-commerce companies (such as Amazon) and financial services companies (such as and MasterCard), eBay has trailed its peers in both valuation and performance over all relevant time periods.\n\n2) It would create more-focused management:\n\nIn our opinion, eBay and PayPal would benefit tremendously from having their own independent management teams focused only on making the best strategic decisions regarding the long-term health of their respective businesses. We believe that independent management teams, together with newly constituted boards of directors (as further described below), would bring an increased level of focus to the decisions that need to be made as eBay and PayPal travel along different trajectories.\n\n3) PayPal could attract better talent:\n\nWe believe the stock of an independent PayPal would be a valuable currency for future acquisition opportunities. Ebay recently paid $800 million in cash to acquire Braintree on behalf of PayPal. We believe consolidation in the currently fragmented and quickly developing payment processing industry is inevitable, and an independent PayPal, armed with its own stock as currency, will be better able to participate advantageously in that inevitable consolidation.\n\n4) It could free PayPal up to form new partnerships:\n\nFor example, we believe a standalone PayPal would be more able to pursue potential strategic partnerships with other industry leaders, such as Visa, MasterCard, Google, Facebook, Alibaba, etc., that could solidify PayPal\u2019s long-term relevance.\n\n5) It maintains the current eBay\/PayPal mojo:\n\nWe believe that the only potentially legitimate defense that eBay\u2019s management has offered to date \u2013 certain synergies that result from keeping eBay and PayPal together \u2013 can be maintained through a contractual business relationship consummated before an IPO and do not actually require eBay owning 100% of PayPal.\n\n6) PayPal could move faster and make itself into a bank:\n\nWe believe PayPal has a significant opportunity to expand its product offerings to include check writing, direct deposits, interest on PayPal balances and other financial conveniences that consumers expect, which were highlighted by David O. Sacks, one of the original architects of PayPal.[6] Under the current eBay leadership, PayPal has actually removed beneficial services to customers such as providing interest on PayPal deposits. We believe that focus from a dedicated management team, unencumbered by competing agendas, could drive more innovation at a faster pace.\n\n7) It would create more focused boards:\n\nWe believe PayPal has a significant opportunity to expand its product offerings to include check writing, direct deposits, interest on PayPal balances and other financial conveniences that consumers expect, which were highlighted by David O. Sacks, one of the original architects of PayPal.[6] Under the current eBay leadership, PayPal has actually removed beneficial services to customers such as providing interest on PayPal deposits. We believe that focus from a dedicated management team, unencumbered by competing agendas, could drive more innovation at a faster pace.\n\nI agree that the spin off would unlock shareholder value that's trapped in the two-headed company. Ebay's marketplace business and PayPal's payment business are different beasts with two different earning multiples (Bank of America analyst, Justin Post, puts a 14x multiple on eBay's marketplace business and a 22x multiple on PayPal). By spinning off PayPal, you can release the PayPal premium, and give investors a clear vision of how the companies plan to grow and make money. I also think the spin off would open PayPal up to new partnerships (after all, big tech retailers--and potential customers--like Amazon see eBay as a competitor) and would give more freedom for PayPal to act like a bank. As I wrote before, both Elon Musk and David Sacks think that PayPal could be the largest bank on the planet and eventually hit a valuation of $100 billion--but it can't make that leap while still part of eBay (for one, eBay doesn't want to be regulated like a bank, nor should it want to be). PayPal could split off and become a financial company and (as Icahn, Musk and Sacks argue) maintain the profitable synergy with eBay's marketplace business through a contract.\n\nI don't agree, however, with the Icahn proposal that the spin off would help PayPal attract new talent and create new products--PayPal is already doing that. PayPal's new president David Marcus has been busy overhauling the payment company since he took over two years ago. He's made smart acquisitions (Braintree), rebuilt the entire technology stack (Node.js), launched new products (PayPal Here, PayPal Wallet, PayPal Beacon) and attracted top talent like Bill Scot (Netflix) Arnold Goldberg (Box) and Stan Chudnovsky (Iron Pearl).\n\nEbay and PayPal must separate one day. In 2013 PayPal's revenue grew 20% to $6.6 billion--41% of eBay\u2019s total revenue and 36% of its profits. In the next few years, PayPal will overtake eBay's marketplace business and would likely be spun off soon after. But for now, eBay is adamant about holding onto PayPal and has created a special website dubbed \"Better Together\" to defend it's stance against Icahn's complaints.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nEbay has responded to Icahn's 20% spin off idea:\n\nPayPal and eBay are better together. That\u2019s been true for the past five years, during which time PayPal and eBay have generated a 441% increase in share price for our investors, significantly outpacing NASDAQ and the S&P. And we continue to believe PayPal and eBay together is the best path to creating sustainable, long-term shareholder value in the future. As the lines between online and offline commerce continue to blur, the competitive advantages of PayPal and eBay together are more important than ever.... In fact, as part of eBay Inc., PayPal has built relationships with VISA, MasterCard, American Express and Discover, with the world\u2019s leading point-of-sale providers, and with leading global companies such as Facebook and Samsung. Together, PayPal and eBay have strong, real synergies that benefit both businesses... A partial separation of PayPal is not a new idea, and we\u2019re glad to see that Mr. Icahn now seems to agree that a full separation of PayPal is not a good idea. Our board regularly evaluates strategic options for the company, looking at the best ways to enhance our competitiveness, accelerate growth and deliver sustainable shareholder value... Will a partial spin make PayPal more competitive? Will it accelerate growth? Will it be possible without distracting PayPal at a critically important time? And, importantly, will it create sustainable value for shareholders over time? Today, we believe the answer to these questions is no. Not now. In the future, our board will continue to evaluate all strategic options and make the right decisions for shareholders.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @Stevenbertoni","339":"CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

Such a move, in Icahn\u2019s opinion, would let PayPal use its own stock to complete acquisitions and attract talent while providing investors with a clearer understanding of each company\u2019s value.\n\nIn an interview with Re\/code in January, eBay CEO John Donahoe said that commercial agreements required to maintain a relationship between the two companies in such a spinoff would likely negatively impact the profitability of PayPal.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s PayPal\u2019s integration on eBay, whether it\u2019s signing up new users, or using data, you\u2019d have to find arms-length pricing on all of those, which would obviously have an impact,\u201d he said.","342":"Carl Icahn won't give up on nagging eBay over selling PayPal (among many other things), but a new suggestion demonstrates he might be backing down -- albeit slightly.\n\nThe American business magnate published yet another open letter to eBay shareholders on Wednesday, outlining a scheme in which eBay sells off 20 percent of PayPal through an initial public offering.\n\nAs described by Icahn, the online marketplace conglomerate would then be able to keep the majority of PayPal.\n\nAside from the rather lengthy proposal, Icahn reiterated his disappointment (to put it lightly) in eBay's leadership:\n\nOver the last few weeks, we have raised a number of troubling questions regarding corporate governance at eBay. Sadly, in our opinion, these questions have never been adequately answered by eBay. Now, we have given a basic overview of the reasons we believe a 20% IPO of PayPal could be advantageous for the companies, employees and stockholders. We hope that eBay\u2019s management is paying attention and decides to respond to this first message on the topic in a productive, transparent manner.\n\nIcahn concluded by stressing he believes in the value of PayPal, but warned \"it is on the verge of going to war against strong adversaries, and only with the benefits of being an independent company, as described above, will PayPal be capable of winning that war.\"\n\nThis new suggestion regarding the future of the digital payments brand is only the latest incursion between eBay and Icahn's inventment group empire.\n\nThe trouble with eBay started in January amid the company's fourth quarter earnings report. At the time, Icahn suggested (putting it mildly) that PayPal should be spun off .\n\nEbay didn't agree .\n\nBy the end of February , Pierre Omidyar, founder and chairman of the board of eBay Inc., published a pointed letter rebuffing Icahn's public criticism of eBay CEO John Donahue as well as two prominent shareholders, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen and Intuit founder Scott Cook.\n\nSince then there has been a flurry of public memos and outbursts volleyed back and forth, including one by Icahn arguing that Icahn that Andreessen had too many conflicts during the Skype sale , putting up his reputation for further scrutiny.\n\nThen last week , eBay took things to a new level in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, urging shareholders to ignore both Icahn's nominees for the board of directors while encouraging them to re-elect CEO John Donahoe and director Fred Anderson.","343":"Carl Icahn is not an activist investor who gives up easily. Nor does he give up without a fight. When it comes to his stance on eBay Inc. (NASDAQ: EBAY), however, Icahn might be starting to understand that his fight to remove board members and to get a spinoff of PayPal is becoming futile.\n\nIcahn issued a statement yet again on Wednesday via his Shareholders\u2019 Square Table with a call for eBay to listen. He simply suggests that an initial public offering of 20% of PayPal would make sense. This would effectively create a tracking stock.\n\nIt was just this week that eBay pointed out that Icahn\u2019s value efforts crushed the former airline of TWA. By coming out with a proposal now of creating only a 20% stake IPO, it sure looks like Icahn is starting to move on down the road.\n\nExcerpts of Icahn\u2019s statement said:\n\nWe believe eBay could easily conduct an Initial Public Offering of PayPal, selling 20% to the public. eBay would retain 80% of PayPal with control. Before the transaction is consummated the companies could enter into a long-term, commercially viable contract, preserving all synergies. \u2026 Luckily for PayPal, competitors such as Google, Apple and many others do not yet have the same comparable scale and product offerings, \u2026 We believe conducting a 20% IPO of PayPal \u2014 and creating two dedicated and highly-focused independent businesses \u2014 will provide the best opportunity for these businesses to remain competitive over the long-term. The 20% IPO structure should alleviate any concern of lost synergies. All of the \u201csecret sauce\u201d and \u201cflywheels\u201d would be preserved \u2026\n\nIcahn also has a bullet list and supporting materials provided as well, in quite a lengthy presentation. The main points, without the long summaries on each, were as follows:\n\nHighlights value\n\nFocuses management teams\n\nCreates a valuable currency for acquisitions and attracting top talent\n\nPrevents dissynergies\n\nPreserves current synergies\n\nExtends PayPal\u2019s product offerings\n\nAllows for true \u201cworld-class\u201d boards\n\nAgain, this seems like the beginning stages of an admission that his efforts are falling on deaf ears. Sometimes billionaires have the same problem as the rest of us \u2014 they just cannot get people to do what they want them to do.\n\neBay insiders and many outsiders are pressing back against Icahn\u2019s attempt to bust up the company to unlock value. It turns out that creating value today might not be worth as much as business models and the business climates change through time.\n\neBay shares were up 0.2% at $57.97 in mid-afternoon trading on Wednesday, against a 52-week range of $48.06 to $59.70. The consensus analyst price target on eBay is just above $63.","344":"Carl Icahn is changing strategies in his battle with eBay over its PayPal payments subsidiary.\n\nThe activist investor now wants eBay to sell 20% of PayPal in a \u201cpartial IPO,\u201d rather than a full spinoff. Icahn\u2019s latest salvo appears to be a softening of his original stance that PayPal is being stifled as a unit of eBay.\n\nEBay has battled Icahn to preserve the company as it is, saying PayPal\u2019s growth is dependent on the marketplace business.\n\nRead the full Wall Street Journal story here.","345":"Perth \u2019no bogans\u2019 job ad unhelpful but not illegal\n\nLawyers rule Perth \u2019no bogans\u2019 job ad unhelpful but not illegal\n\n\u2018Why would I fight Anthony Mundine again?

Even for Icahn, a billionaire investor who is known for his verboseness and who has engaged in other, very public battles against big firms, this latest lambasting is pretty intense.\n\nWrite Icahn: \u201cWhile the board and its advisors may try to use tricks and technicalities to keep documentary evidence of malfeasance out of the hands of stockholders, I believe that ultimately truth will win out. It may not be in time for this year\u2019s annual meeting and it may even take years, but I believe that we will ultimately be successful in forcing eBay to come clean with its stockholders and disclose publicly all documents relating to the Skype affair, only some of the sordid details of which we recently exposed. And when that day comes, I believe that eBay, CEO John Donahoe, director Marc Andreessen and Chairman and founder Pierre Omidyar will be forced to recant their statements that my claims were \u2018false and misleading.'\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s this all about?\n\nIcahn thinks eBay\u2019s sale of Skype in 2009 was a dirty deal. In 2005, eBay bought the video chat service Skype for $2.6 billion, only to divest it four year later for about $2 billion to an investor group that included Marc Andreessen\u2019s venture capital firm (it was a 3 percent shareholder). Andreessen, a big-time Silicon Valley investor, is also on the eBay board of directors. Icahn has accused Andreessen of conflict of interest in the Skype deal, and eBay of mishandling the entire deal and keeping secrets from stockholders.\n\nIcahn alleges that, in the Skype sale, eBay \u201cgave away $4.5 billion to a board member,\u201d and did so at the expense of eBay\u2019s shareholders.\n\neBay CEO John Donahoe has acknowledged that the Skype sale didn\u2019t work out as planned, but has otherwise defended Andreessen and himself. Andreessen, Donahoe said, recused himself from the Skype deal.\n\nIcahn asked for eBay to release documents about the sale, saying in a March 12 note that \u201cnothing stays buried for long.\u201d But eBay refused, and told Re\/code in a statement:\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe he is legally entitled to what he has asked for,\u201d eBay said. \u201cBut we told him that we will give him relevant documents if he signs a customary and standard confidentiality agreement. We have not heard back from him. Relevant facts about the Skype transaction are publicly available on our website for everyone to see.\u201d\n\nIcahn has also called for eBay to spin off PayPal, the online and mobile payments processor that eBay bought in 2002. PayPal\u2019s growth has outpaced eBay\u2019s other services, and some analysts have said eBay\u2019s success in coming back from the dot-com bust is largely due to PayPal, and PayPal CEO David Marcus. eBay\u2019s Donahoe has loudly rejected Icahn\u2019s calls to spin off PayPal, and last week the company also rejected Icahn\u2019s nominations for two new eBay board members. Icahn fired back that eBay needed the new board members to prevent the type of \u201cincompetence\u201d that he says characterized the Skype sale.\n\n\u201cThe Skype debacle represents in my mind a complete and utter breakdown in the system of checks and balances that a properly functioning board should provide and proves to me that new blood is needed in the boardroom immediately,\u201d Icahn wrote in his letter on Tuesday.\n\nFor now, it doesn\u2019t appear that either side is backing down, and the eBay war rages on. Donahoe told employees that \u201cthe noise is going to get louder over the next four to six to eight weeks. Don\u2019t pay attention to the noise. Stay focused, and don\u2019t be distracted.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s one possible \u2014 although arguably far-fetched \u2014 solution: have Google buy eBay. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said in a note that \u201cwe believe one potential \u2018home run\u2019 opportunity missing from the discourse is a combination of Google with eBay\/PayPal.\u201d\n\nFile photo: Carl Icahn, billionaire investor and chairman of Icahn Enterprises Holdings LP, talks outside of the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York, U.S., on Tuesday, March 27, 2012.

We believe Mr. Icahn will present his argument ahead of the shareholder meeting scheduled for early May.\n\nWe expect the following points to be made (with our quick thoughts):\n\n1. PayPal will likely benefit from the power of focus. We believe PayPal is already the focus of all of eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) and most of its investments.\n\n2. PayPal would be a more attractive employer. PayPal\u2019s retention of acquired executives and longstanding reputation in Silicon Valley is already very attractive.\n\n3. PayPal will be able to form relationships it is currently limited from forming. While we believe Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and\/or Alibaba are unlikely to ever accept PayPal, we do think this is a key argument. In fact, we believe that if PayPal was independent AXP, MA and V may clamor to own the one and only property that gives a concentrated presence in the fastest growing segment of commerce, 143 million consumers and millions of merchant relationships.\n\nItems in ebay\u2019s favor\n\nWe believe that the current debate may encourage management to tilt the balance more towards delivering strong 2014 results, given the inverse relationship between support for spin-off and the share price.\n\nStable ecommerce, retail and currency should make upside easier to achieve (pages 2-4). Recent US data from comScore has shown improving trends in February and eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY)\u2019s currency basket has recently been working in its favor.\n\nReiterate OUTPERFORM and price target of $70. Our price target represents a 20x P\/FE multiple our 2015 estimate, a 10% discount to V and MA, the closest comparables, based on the size of eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY)\u2019s opportunity, somewhat offset by management\u2019s caution for 2014.","348":"Today Carl C. Icahn released the following open letter to stockholders of eBay Inc (NASDAQ: EBAY)\n\nIPO 20% of PayPal\n\nWe believe eBay could easily conduct an Initial Public Offering of PayPal, selling 20% to the public. eBay would retain 80% of PayPal with control. Before the transaction is consummated the companies could enter into a long-term, commercially viable contract, preserving all synergies. This type of relationship is customary in partial IPOs and would be particularly important for eBay as currently, outside of PayPal, there does not exist a global payment processing solution competent enough to service eBay's users. Luckily for PayPal, competitors such as Google, Apple and many others do not yet have the same comparable scale and product offerings.\n\nWe believe conducting a 20% IPO of PayPal \u2013 and creating two dedicated and highly-focused independent businesses \u2013 will provide the best opportunity for these businesses to remain competitive over the long-term. The 20% IPO structure should alleviate any concern of lost synergies. All of the \u201csecret sauce\u201d and \u201cflywheels\u201d would be preserved. A 20% IPO of PayPal could allow for all of the benefits of an independent PayPal, preserves all of the benefits of keeping PayPal in-house and could be structured so as to be tax free to shareholders.\n\nBenefits of a 20% IPO of PayPal\n\n1) Highlights Value\n\nCurrently, we believe the fair market value of eBay and PayPal are shrouded by a conglomerate discount. When compared to other e-commerce companies (such as Amazon) and financial services companies (such as Visa and MasterCard), eBay has trailed its peers in both valuation and performance over all relevant time periods.[1] We believe the fact that eBay and PayPal are currently combined makes it difficult for investors and analysts to properly value and fully understand the underlying businesses. We believe that a separation of the businesses will allow investors and analysts to more clearly see the value of both the sustainable double digit growth at PayPal and the strong recurring free cash flows of eBay. Both eBay and PayPal are tremendously strong businesses, but they appeal to different types of investors. We expect that an IPO of PayPal, thereby creating two focused equities, each with clear prospects and strategies for investors and analysts to consider, would enable both companies to attract a more natural shareholder base.\n\n2) Focuses Management Teams\n\nIn our opinion, eBay and PayPal would benefit tremendously from having their own independent management teams focused only on making the best strategic decisions regarding the long-term health of their respective businesses. We believe that independent management teams, together with newly constituted boards of directors (as further described below), would bring an increased level of focus to the decisions that need to be made as eBay and PayPal travel along different trajectories. Each company needs, among other things, its own business-specific long-term operational, financial and business development strategies. We believe fully focused management teams and boards of directors will be essential in ensuring long-term value creation in both businesses.\n\n3) Creates a Valuable Currency for Acquisitions and Attracting Top Talent\n\nWe believe the stock of an independent PayPal would be a valuable currency for future acquisition opportunities. eBay recently paid $800 million in cash to acquire Braintree on behalf of PayPal. We believe consolidation in the currently fragmented and quickly developing payment processing industry is inevitable, and an independent PayPal, armed with its own stock as currency, will be better able to participate advantageously in that inevitable consolidation. In fact, a more valuable currency would allow PayPal to take advantage of even more opportunities in the marketplace (as so many other technology companies do). While we are not currently advocating any specific acquisition, we believe it is likely that PayPal will continue to expand the scope of its technology through acquisitions.\n\nIn addition, from our research, it is clear to us that eBay and PayPal have faced significant challenges in recruiting top talent. In the words of Mr. David Marcus, the President of PayPal: \u201cUnder the old format many great technologists left. If you had a choice between Google and PayPal you'd go to Google.\u201d [2] While Mr. Marcus may believe this problem is no longer the case after only two years in his current post, we believe the reality is that the best minds are not going to eBay. We hope that Mr. Marcus has started changing the perception of eBay, but we believe PayPal would be much better positioned to attract and motivate top talent, which is the lifeblood of its business, with an incentive plan that was tied to the successful operating performance of PayPal and its own stock price. Just recently (February 2014), in an email from Mr. Marcus to PayPal employees at eBay's headquarters in San Jose[3], Mr. Marcus lamented how disinterested employees were relative to other PayPal offices. This type of direct communication from PayPal's President only reinforces our belief that PayPal employees will be more motivated when the company operates independently of eBay, with a clear strategic vision and a currency which would be more closely aligned with the performance of its employees.\n\n4) Prevents Dissynergies\n\nAlthough eBay's management asserts that there are \u201csynergies\u201d that exist only by keeping eBay and PayPal together, they offer little in the way of quantitative support. On the other hand, we believe there are in fact significant \u201cdissynergies\u201d that burden the companies by keeping them together. For example, we believe a standalone PayPal would be more able to pursue potential strategic partnerships with other industry leaders, such as Visa, MasterCard, Google, Facebook, Alibaba, etc., that could solidify PayPal's long-term relevance. This could include potential strategic investments. Facebook recently paid $19 billion for WhatsApp (of which only $4 billion was cash, the balance stock), a global messaging service. But, for a fraction of that price, Facebook could have instead purchased a significant stake in PayPal and launched the service across its platform \u2013 talk about value creation! We believe this same situation would hold for Apple, Google, and many others who could stand to gain by partnering with PayPal. We believe it is clear within eBay, these opportunities simply do not exist for PayPal. As another example, according to industry sources, PayPal recently ended a successful partnership with Aliexpress.com, in fear of the company ultimately competing with eBay.[4] In our opinion, with PayPal as a standalone company, this profitable and growing relationship would not have ended prematurely.\n\n5) Preserves Current Synergies\n\nWe believe that the only potentially legitimate defense that eBay's management has offered to date \u2013 certain synergies that result from keeping eBay and PayPal together \u2013 can be maintained through a contractual business relationship consummated before an IPO and do not actually require eBay owning 100% of PayPal. Some of the synergies eBay's CEO John Donahoe has expounded are, in our opinion, imagined. For example, we believe that funding the growth of an independent PayPal, which Mr. Donahoe seems to believe only eBay can do,[5] would never be an issue for an independent PayPal because it generates over $2 billion in EBITDA and would have a strong cash balance as the combined company currently has nearly $14 billion of cash on the balance sheet which would only grow with incremental IPO proceeds. Either way, we believe, as many other companies have proved, eBay's 80% ownership of PayPal and a commercially advantageous long-term contract between the two companies, would preserve any potential synergies.\n\n6) Extends PayPal's Product Offerings\n\nWe believe PayPal has a significant opportunity to expand its product offerings to include check writing, direct deposits, interest on PayPal balances and other financial conveniences that consumers expect, which were highlighted by David O. Sacks, one of the original architects of PayPal.[6] Under the current eBay leadership, PayPal has actually removed beneficial services to customers such as providing interest on PayPal deposits. We believe that focus from a dedicated management team, unencumbered by competing agendas, could drive more innovation at a faster pace. eBay is akin to a slow moving battleship at sea, which may be fine for eBay, as its marketplace business is not capable of the growth rates experienced a decade ago. PayPal, on the other hand, needs to be able to react quickly to a rapidly changing payments landscape, not only in the face of new competitors such as Square (a company eBay director Marc Andreessen publicly stated he wished he invested in), Bitcoin (the digital currency Mr. Andreessen cheerleads for), Boku (an Andreessen investment), Coinbase (another Andreessen investment), Dwolla (another Andreessen investment), and Jumio (yet again, another Andreessen investment), among others, but also in the face of competition from technology juggernauts such as Google, Apple and Intuit (where eBay director Scott Cook owns over $1 billion in stock and is an employee, board member and chairman of the executive committee). PayPal needs to have a startup mentality as it seeks to capitalize on its head start in the fast growing multi-trillion dollar global payments industry. We believe that this has not and will not happen successfully within eBay.\n\n7) Allows for True \u201cWorld-Class\u201d Boards\n\nAs separate companies, eBay and PayPal would have the opportunity to reconstitute their boards of directors and appoint board members who are not conflicted and do not compete with the underlying companies. We believe there are many great minds in the world who would be honored to serve as fiduciaries for the stockholders of an independent eBay or an independent PayPal.\n\nConclusion\n\nOver the last few weeks, we have raised a number of troubling questions regarding corporate governance at eBay. Sadly, in our opinion, these questions have never been adequately answered by eBay. Now, we have given a basic overview of the reasons we believe a 20% IPO of PayPal could be advantageous for the companies, employees and stockholders. We hope that eBay's management is paying attention and decides to respond to this first message on the topic in a productive, transparent manner.\n\nPayPal is a tremendous company, but it is on the verge of going to war against strong adversaries, and only with the benefits of being an independent company, as described above, will PayPal be capable of winning that war. We look forward to continuing to share with all shareholders our thoughts over the coming weeks and thank you for your continued support of our efforts.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCarl C.

Icahn wants to shake up the board and senior management of eBay and then spin off PayPal into a separate company.\n\nTWA excerpt mirrors some of Icahn\u2019s own allegations\n\nNothing in the excerpt is really new to people familiar with Icahn\u2019s career. He was one of the 1980\u2019s consummate corporate raiders and an inspiration for the film Wall Street, and no one doubts that he can play tough. But the subtext of the excerpt that Andreessen chose is interesting because it mirrors the allegations that Icahn has been leveling against him for months.\n\nAside from accusations of general mismanagement, Icahn says that it was a conflict of interest when Andreessen bought Skype from eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) while sitting on the board, and then flipped it a few years later for a large profit. He also takes objection to Andreessen sitting on the board while he owns significant stakes in some of eBay\u2019s direct competitors.\n\n\u201cThe Skype debacle represents in my mind a complete and utter breakdown in the system of checks and balances that a properly functioning board should provide and proves to me that new blood is needed in the boardroom immediately,\u201d Icahn wrote today in an SEC filing. \u201cWhat exactly is \u201cworld class\u201d about participating in a consortium that buys assets from the company and flips them for a quick and massive profit (current board member, Marc Andreessen)?\u201d\n\nAndreessen unintentionally casts himself as Lorenzo\n\nBy showcasing how Icahn made hundreds of millions in profits while TWA went into permanent decline, Andreessen is trying to give shareholders the impression that they should be careful what they wish for.\n\n\u201cAs had happened 16 years earlier, when the fear of Frank Lorenzo drove TWA\u2019s employees into the arms of an arguably deadlier foe, the specter of Icahn, who made a $1.1-billion offer and said he would keep the airline independent while demanding labor concessions and making job cuts, made the American offer seem aglow with promise,\u201d writes Grant in the excerpt Andreessen chose.\n\nIt\u2019s ironic that Andreessen seems to be casting himself as Lorenzo in this historical metaphor, implying that he is the lesser of two evils as shareholders decide who to vote for in the looming proxy fight.","350":"Icahn Sounds Off After EBay Spurns Request For Skype Docs\n\nLaw360, New York (March 18, 2014, 8:03 PM EDT) -- Carl Icahn fired back Tuesday at eBay Inc.\u2019s assertions that he had no legal right to peek into the company\u2019s books and records in connection with its 2009 sale of Skype, saying the truth will come out about the allegedly shady maneuverings behind that deal.\n\n\n\nIn what has become an increasingly nasty battle between the billionaire activist investor and the California-based online auctioneer over eBay's direction and leadership, Icahn\u2019s latest open letter accuses eBay\u2019s top brass of using trickery to thwart his attempt to get at...\n\nTo view the full article, register now.","351":"Wall Street has suggested many things to Silicon Valley -- to give dividends, to break up part of their business or make other business decisions.

With surcharges and complex payments for vendors, PayPal is far from a panacea. If shopping for a quality online payment source, Google should consider other, simpler alternatives that may not be on the market.","352":"Stifel Equity Trading Desk analysts Christopher C. Brendler and John Davis suggest that PayPal\u2019s strategic positioning does not look favorable for a separation, in their report dated March 17, 2014.\n\nAlthough market conditions are ripe for a spin, our analysis of PayPal\u2019s strategic positioning does not suggest material benefits from a separation from eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY). On the contrary, we believe eBay mgmt is laser focused on PayPal and its unique capability to lead next-gen retailing. While recent execution has been choppy, PayPal continues to grow rapidly through both online and offline wallets and dominates both channels today. Despite this early lead, however, competition is set to heat up dramatically and we still believe PayPal is vulnerable to new threats. With Icahn helping the stock to ignore these risks and \u201comni-channel\u201d still just a concept, we expect PayPal to struggle to meet increasing expectations.\n\nCarl Icahn\u2019s moves to spinoff PayPal\n\nCarl Icahn\u2018s bold moves to force eBay to spin-off PayPal has shifted our attention to mobile payments and the growing potential for transformational changes in brick-and-mortar retailing. In our view, PayPal is in a unique leadership position with a dominant online wallet, trusted global brand, and growing base of both consumers and merchants. Although PayPal has struggled so far to gain significant traction offline, it remains early and we believe the company\u2019s strategic positioning has improved recently with strong partnerships, smart acquisitions, and keen strategic decisions.\n\nMoreover, despite powerful potential competitors, PayPal not only continues to dominate online, it is the far and away leader offline as well with nearly 4x the acceptance of its nearest competitor, Google. With deep retailing experience and the only scaled mobile wallet in the world, we view PayPal as the leading contender to drive next-generation mobile-powered commerce.\n\nPayPal\u2019s mobile payment benefits eBay\n\nWe believe this shift to mobile plays to eBay\u2019s strengths. Although expensive, the Braintree acquisition was well-timed as we see mobile as the answer to the question of why PayPal offline. Moreover, mobile ubiquity has broken down the traditional barriers between B&M and ecommerce, and we expect a growing push from B&M after the latest security breaches.\n\nThis could create opportunities for PayPal, but recent execution has not fueled confidence. Although its lead is still expanding both online and offline, it is still so early and the industry is evolving too rapidly to predict even leading contenders at this point. Although competition has struggled, no one\u2019s giving up and we still see a significant and growing threat to PayPal, both online and offline. Not only are there hundreds of potential competitors, major threats like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are now close while Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Visa Inc (NYSE:V) remain as committed as ever.\n\nFinally, we still struggle to find a compelling case for PayPal offline. Consumers to date have shown little interest in offline digital wallets and it remains to be seen if there is a \u201ckiller app\u201d to revolutionize B&M payments. While Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), Uber, and OpenTable Inc (NASDAQ:OPEN) showcase the potential, all three represent unique time-saving opportunities that are hard to apply to mainstream B&M retail. PayPal\u2019s offline dreams are powered by mobile not payments, and we question how well PayPal can leverage its online success to successfully compete on POS technology\/software at the B&M retailer.\n\nStill, given the extraordinary pace of change and incredible potential in mobile-driven commerce, we give PayPal a shot so we do not think PayPal should be spun-off today. In addition to all the reasons laid out by our colleague Jordan Rohan (\u201cActivist Interest Creates Tricky Situation, Risks For Investors\u201d also out today), we\u2019re not sure it is worth the distraction at this critical juncture. In our view, eBay mgmt is squarely focused on its unique \u201comni-channel\u201d opportunity and investing heavily so we see no major strategic benefits from a near-term spin-off.","353":"For the last several weeks, activist investor Carl Icahn, eBay, and board member Marc Andreessen have been exchanging increasingly dramatic open letters, with Icahn insisting that eBay needs to replace its board of directors - in particular Andreessen and Scott Cook.\n\nIcahn doesn't think that eBay should have sold part of Skype to an investment group that Andreessen was part of.\n\nToday, Icahn released another open letter , reiterating his claims against Andreessen and Cook, accusing eBay of purposely withholding evidence of wrong-doings and bad decision making, and making it clear that he believes that \"eventually the truth will out.\"\n\nThis week, Lions Gate had to pay $7.5 million to the SEC because it failed to fully and accurately disclose information about the company to shareholders when it was on the brink of a major decision - and when Icahn was waging a war against the company similar to the one he is waging now on eBay. He uses this recent case to prove that he's not \"easy to defeat\" and claims that Andreessen and eBay's CEO, John Donahoe, who have called his previous statements \"false and misleading,\" will have to eat their words.\n\n\"While the board and its advisors may try to use tricks and technicalities to keep documentary evidence of malfeasance out of the hands of stockholders, I believe that ultimately truth will win out,\" he writes. \"It may not be in time for this year's annual meeting and it may even take years, but I believe that we will ultimately be successful in forcing eBay to come clean with its stockholders and disclose publicly all documents relating to the Skype affair, only some of the sordid details of which we recently exposed. And when that day comes, I believe that eBay, CEO John Donahoe, director Marc Andreessen and Chairman and founder Pierre Omidyar will be forced to recant their statements that my claims were \"false and misleading.\"\n\nHere's the whole post:\n\nLittle did I know when I wrote on March 12 th that \" NOTHING STAYS BURIED FOR LONG \" how quickly those words would turn out to be prophetic. On March 13, 2014, the SEC charged Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. with failing to fully and accurately disclose to investors a key aspect of its effort to thwart our 2010 takeover bid and Lions Gate agreed to pay $7.5 million and admit wrongdoing to settle the SEC's charges. [1] \"Lions Gate withheld material information just as its shareholders were faced with a critical decision about the future of the company ,\" said Andrew J. Ceresney, director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. I believe this long overdue vindication of our claims highlights just how far companies and their \"defense\" counselors are willing to go in order to prevent stockholders from having a voice in the boardroom and \"interfering\" with management. As Forbes stated: \" It isn't easy to defeat Icahn and on Thursday Lions Gate Entertainment admitted that in order to beat him, the company had committed some wrongdoing.\" [2] It seems that nothing is out of bounds these days - including crossing clear legal boundaries into lying, cheating and, as we have seen in some highly public cases, even conduct not much different than outright theft - when management feels threatened by stockholders who are not satisfied with the choice of either accepting the status quo or voting with their feet. And there also seems unfortunately to be no shortage of \"advisors\" willing to breach ethical standards to devise and bless these schemes for management. Which brings me to the case of eBay. While the board and its advisors may try to use tricks and technicalities to keep documentary evidence of malfeasance out of the hands of stockholders, I believe that ultimately truth will win out. It may not be in time for this year's annual meeting and it may even take years, but I believe that we will ultimately be successful in forcing eBay to come clean with its stockholders and disclose publicly all documents relating to the Skype affair, only some of the sordid details of which we recently exposed. And when that day comes, I believe that eBay, CEO John Donahoe, director Marc Andreessen and Chairman and founder Pierre Omidyar will be forced to recant their statements that my claims were \"false and misleading.\" The Skype debacle represents in my mind a complete and utter breakdown in the system of checks and balances that a properly functioning board should provide and proves to me that new blood is needed in the boardroom immediately. Sadly, it is not the only example of poor judgment on the part of eBay's board of directors - who refer to themselves as \"world class.\" Maybe I'm missing it. What exactly is \"world class\" about being a large stockholder of a direct competitor and interfering, as alleged by the Department of Justice, with eBay's hiring practices on behalf of said direct competitor (current board nominee, Scott Cook)? What exactly is \"world class\" about participating in a consortium that buys assets from the company and flips them for a quick and massive profit (current board member, Marc Andreessen)? What exactly is \"world class\" about failing, as alleged by the SEC, to take steps to ensure that the accounting for stock options was proper and agreeing to disgorgement and civil penalties amounting to over $3.5 million (current board nominee, Fred Anderson)? eBay's board has stated that our director nominees are \"not qualified candidates.\" Why are they not qualified? Let's compare them to the individuals currently serving on the board. Our nominees have not been accused of improprieties by the Department of Justice or the Securities and Exchange Commission. Can the same be said for the sitting directors? Our nominees will not have massive investments in direct competitors. Can the same be said for the sitting directors? Though I cannot predict the future, I am comfortable assuring stockholders that our nominees will not buy assets from eBay and flip them for a quick profit. Can the same be said for the sitting directors? The question of whether eBay and PayPal should be separated is now legitimately before the stockholders and is being debated by many in the media and academia. Maybe our proposal will garner majority stockholder support and maybe it will not. But I believe that if it is left as a division of eBay, PayPal may well go the way of other former technology greats such as Blackberry, Dell, Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Nintendo, Xerox, Sony, Palm, and AOL - the same way that Motorola Mobility may have gone had we not been able to convince Motorola's board to bring in a new CEO and separate the companies - ultimately resulting in a sale to Google. Sadly in our opinion and the opinion of others eBay does not have years to wait.\n\nDisclosure: Marc Andreessen is an investor in Business Insider.","354":"Today: As Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba plans to generate millions in IPO, analyst suggests Google should acquire eBay to compete in changing, challenging online environment. Also: Wall Street bounces back from rough week.\n\nThe Lead: Is a Google-eBay merger the cure for what ails companies?\n\nGoogle is struggling to keep up with rivals in the e-commerce and payments arenas. eBay is being openly and forcefully challenged to spin off its PayPal online-payments company while Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba plans for a huge cash infusion on these shores.\n\nOne analyst\u2019s solution: A common front.\n\nBaird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in a note Monday morning that an acquisition of eBay by Google represents \u201ca possible \u2018best of both worlds\u2019 opportunity\u201d that would provide eBay investors the extra value that Carl Icahn is seeking to unlock while boosting Google segments that are currently struggling.\n\n\u201cWe believe acquiring eBay\/PayPal would be one way for Google to secure quickly a strong leadership position in commerce and payments, and likewise, could represent a better strategic option than alternatives proposed for eBay,\u201d the analyst wrote Monday.\n\nWhile eBay\u2019s tussle with Icahn has been very public, Sebastian focuses more on Google\u2019s ability to keep up in payments, where its Google Wallet mobile-payments solution has yet to catch on, and the burgeoning e-commerce industry, where the competition keeps getting tougher.\n\n\u201cGoogle is losing share in e-commerce search to Amazon, with more competition on the horizon from companies such as Alibaba, Pinterest and social networks Facebook, Twitter and potentially messaging apps,\u201d Sebastian wrote.\n\nAlibaba announced Sunday that it would hold an initial public offering in the United States, which could bring the Chinese company a record-breaking cash haul for a technology company. Another Google competitor, Yahoo, stands to profit handsomely, as the Sunnyvale Internet giant owns 24 percent of the company even after selling half its stake for roughly $7.6 billion in 2012. Yahoo stock gained 4 percent to $39.11 Monday.\n\nAlibaba joins fellow Chinese Web giant Sina, which operates Twitter rival Weibo, as upcoming IPOs on American shores that could \u201cfuel direct competition with Google, Facebook and Twitter,\u201d Constellation Research analyst R. Ray Wang told Marketwatch.\n\n\u201cThe big difference when we talk about Alibaba and Weibo is scale,\u201d Wang said Monday. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about is Amazon proportions of scale driving massive amounts of engagement and, of course, revenue.\u201d\n\nA Google acquisition of eBay would be \u201cone of the most expensive ever consummated,\u201d Sebastian admits, with the San Jose company\u2019s market capitalization topping $70 billion. However, the analyst wrote that the deal would be a good one for Google even while paying a premium of up to 50 percent of eBay\u2019s going rate, which would push a purchase price higher than $100 billion.\n\nThe deal also would certainly face antitrust complaints, especially after Google\u2019s recent fight to avoid such charges in Europe due to promotion of its own services in search results.\n\nSebastian labeled his note \u201ca thought exercise\u201d in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Monday, but added that his investigation showed \u201cGoogle has the resources and the strong engineering platform to be able to put eBay and PayPal on their platform successfully.\u201d\n\nGoogle gained 1.7 percent to $526.74 Monday while its instant-messaging offering suffered its second major outage this year, and eBay rose 1.2 percent to $57.42 while explaining that Icahn isn\u2019t legally entitled to documents he is requesting.\n\nSV150 market report: Stocks bounce back, Tesla keeps fighting\n\nWall Street rebounded from a poor showing last week with strong gains Monday, and Silicon Valley joined the charge with a 1 percent gain in the SV150 index of the area\u2019s largest tech companies.\n\nTesla Motors, which suffered somewhat after New Jersey banned its direct-sales approach last week, gained 1.3 percent to $233.98 Monday while fighting a similar tactic in Ohio. Tesla has two stores in Ohio currently and plans to expand there, but Ohio car dealers are fighting to get a bill into the state legislature that would prevent Tesla\u2019s expansion. \u201cThe bill would shut down our ability to grow in the Ohio market and, frankly, it\u2019s just a first step to them shutting down our existing businesses,\u201d Tesla vice president Diarmuid O\u2019Connell told the Associated Press. Despite its challenges, the Palo Alto electric car manufacturer received an upgrade from Baird analyst Ben Kallo, who bumped his price target from $245 to $275.\n\nApple gained 0.4 percent to $526.74 as 9to5Mac reported about the Cupertino company\u2019s further goals in the health arena and ISI Group analyst Brian Marshall predicted the iPhone 6 could be \u201cthe mother lode of all upgrade cycles.\u201d Facebook increased 1.5 percent to $68.74 after striking its first content partnership for the Menlo Park company\u2019s new Paper app; Argus Research analyst Joe Bonner cut his rating of the company, however, noting that the big-money acquisition of WhatsApp carries many risks.

However, Bernstein analysts believe investors are reacting to the possibility of an increased share buyback and other steps rather than the fact of Icahn\u2019s involvement. They consider what it will take for Icahn to just \u201cgo away\u201d in their latest report.\n\nDownside for eBay limited\n\nAnalysts Carlos Kirjner and Peter Paskhaver say eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) may begin increasing its share repurchases as a way to fight back against Icahn. Aside from all the noise the activist investor has made regarding the conflicts of interest he sees with the company\u2019s board members, he has been pushing for a separation of PayPal and eBay MarketPlaces. Contrary to what others have suggested, the Bernstein team thinks investors may not agree with his view that a separation is best for the company.\n\nThey like the fundamentals of both businesses and think that concerns about competition for PayPal and the growth rate of MarketPlaces GMV are exaggerated. They think eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY)\u2019s announcement about an increase in its share repurchase limit, as well as the activist pressure from Icahn, will limit downside to investing in the company.\n\neBay on solid footing\n\nThe Bernstein team says they are still skeptical that there is any value to separating eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY)\u2019s two businesses. They think both of them are on solid footing and that the company\u2019s shares are undervalued. They believe the auction site\u2019s lackluster guidance may be more about conservative expectations from management rather than any rea danger.\n\nThey believe the competitive pressures some investors have been concerned about are nothing but a mix shift from an acceleration in Merchant Services TPV growth and do not think that this has had a visible impact on the payment services provider\u2019s performance. They think eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY)\u2019s MarketPlaces remain competitive as well in the ecommerce sector and is at least maintaining its share of the market.\n\nCarl Icahn may stick around for awhile\n\nThe analysts took a look back at Carl Icahn\u2019s activist history and said that based on past campaigns, he probably won\u2019t go away for several more quarters. In fact, they think he will stick around for at least six months and that eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) will probably make more concessions to the activist investor.\n\nThey note that he has been successful in about half of his campaigns about board representation but \u201csignificantly more successful\u201d in terms of spinoff campaigns. About half of the campaigns in which he fought for board representation involved either a proxy battle or a threat of one. The analysts also found in their study that \u201ca significantly larger proportion of partially won or failed campaigns\u201d did involve proxy fights. This would suggest that most of his wins involved management whose thinking was more similar to Icahn\u2019s thinking than eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY)\u2019s management is.\n\nFor example, Carl Icahn one five of the seven spinoff or asset sales campaigns in the cases they looked at. However, two of them involved a proxy fight, and in both of them, that fight was settled. Since eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) management is putting up such a resistance to a spinoff, they believe Icahn\u2019s campaign will continue for some time. They also note that his proxy battle campaigns over the last ten years have averaged 11 months, with the median campaign lasting eight months.","356":"Dallas, Texas 03\/18\/2014 (ustradevoice) \u2013 Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a search engine giant operating globally to deliver online advertising, distribute platforms, and cultivate enterprise.

We have full reason to believe the acquisition of eBay\/PayPal would be a wise solution for Google to swiftly secure a strong leadership in commerce and payments, and likewise, could present to eBay a better marketing strategy than merely alternatives, the analyst wrote Monday.\n\nBut the Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s acquisition of eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) would be one of the most expensive ever events in the market place. eBay\u2019s market capitalization amounting to $70 billion. However, the deal would be still be a gain instead of loss even while Google is paying a premium of up to 50% of eBay\u2019s going rate, which would activate a purchasing price more than $100 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201ca thought exercise\u201d noted by an analyst in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Monday, but not an impossible execution. Google has the strength of resources and the robust engineering expertise to be able to put eBay and PayPal on their platform successfully. This year, Google achieved 1.7% to $526.74 Monday while its messaging service suffered its second major outage, and eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) rose 1.2% to $57.42 despite all the dubious requests from Icahn.\n\nNot a one way out\n\nBesides all the touting, Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is reportedly aiming for its flagship retail store in Manhattan\u2019s popular Soho neighborhood, just blocks away from where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has one of its biggest retail presence. As Crain reports, Google is at the finishing touch of signing a lease for retail space at 131 Greene St, where other high-end brands like Louis Vuitton, Tiffany\u2019s, etc., rival for their charm.\n\nAs estimated, Google\u2019s arrival could raise the rent on Greene Street even more, resembling what Apple\u2019s store did for Prince Street. The rent and property value in this location has already skyrocketed in recent years, and the participation of Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) will draw more foot traffic to the spot, which will in turn benefit the store fronts with more traffic growth.","357":"A Wall Street analyst thinks he has the solution to the \"eBay versus Carl Icahn\" debate over whether to spin off PayPal: he says Google should buy eBay. Colin Sebastian of RW Baird is muddying the waters with a new proposal that Google acquire eBay, though one that shareholders will not be voting on at eBay's annual meeting next month.\n\nSebastian explained in this CNBC video that Google lacks leadership in ecommerce, has struggled with payments, and has been losing the ecommerce search battle to rival Amazon. An acquisition of eBay and PayPal would be \"a powerhouse combination for Google,\" he said.\n\nIn a research note released on Monday, Sebastian wrote, \"With activist investors recommending the split of PayPal from eBay, we believe a potentially more attractive option is missing from the discussion: Google acquiring eBay\/PayPal would serve not only to \"unlock\" the value of the two segments, but also help solve two of Google's competitive shortcomings.\"\n\nHe was referring to Icahn's pressuring eBay to spinoff PayPal. Carl Icahn has been publicly berating eBay CEO John Donahoe and its Board of Directors to help draw attention to his shareholder proposal (it's working- the financial media are covering every move in the war of words).\n\nSebastian believes ecommerce and payments go together, but like many on Wall Street, he believes \"the sum of parts valuation for eBay is greater than the combined company market value.\"\n\n\"While we see potential benefits for PayPal operating independently, this scenario could prove very challenging for eBay, and as an alternative, a combination with Google could be a \"best of both worlds\" opportunity,\" he said. \"Together with eBay\/PayPal, Google would be in a much stronger position to fend off well-capitalized competitors. Specifically, we note that Larry Page has shown that he is open to large deals, and both companies would likely be stronger together in the significant technology and user arms race unfolding with Amazon, Apple and Facebook.\"\n\nAnother benefit to Google - the analyst said PayPal's transaction data, credit card database, mobile presence and risk management would provide a major boost to Google's advertising platform (e.g., enable more targeted ads, demonstrating advertiser return on ad spend (ROAS), among others).","358":"WATCH, LEARN AND LISTEN WITH IBD VIDEOS\n\nStay on top of the market with IBD's exclusive videos.
